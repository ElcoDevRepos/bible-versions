The term "Redeemer" is significant, as it denotes one who buys back or delivers from bondage, a concept rooted in the Hebrew word "goel," which refers to a kinsman-redeemer. This is reminiscent of the role Boaz played in the Book of Ruth. Zion, a term often used for Jerusalem, represents the spiritual center of God's people. The coming of the Redeemer to Zion is a fulfillment of numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which speak of a ruler coming from Bethlehem to shepherd Israel.<p><b>to those in Jacob who turn from transgression</b><br>This phrase highlights the condition for receiving the Redeemer's deliverance: repentance. "Jacob" is a metonym for the nation of Israel, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and His people. Turning from transgression implies a genuine repentance and a return to God's ways, as seen in the calls to repentance throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>. This turning away from sin is a prerequisite for experiencing the redemption offered by the Messiah, aligning with the New Testament message of repentance and faith in Christ (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that affirms the divine origin of the message. It assures the audience that the promise of redemption is not merely a human hope but a divine decree. This assurance is consistent with the character of God as faithful and true, as seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> and <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>, where God's promises are depicted as unchangeable and reliable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_redeemer.htm">The Redeemer</a></b><br>This refers to the Messiah, who Christians believe is Jesus Christ.

Job confessed, &#8220;I know that my Redeemer lives&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>), and Isaiah earlier described Him as &#8220;pierced for our transgressions&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>- New-Testament writers echo this identity: &#8220;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) and &#8220;you were redeemed&#8230;with the precious blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>- Reading <a href="/bsb/isaiah/59.htm">Isaiah 59</a>, the context shows human sin (vv. 1-15) answered by God&#8217;s own arm bringing salvation (v. 16). The Redeemer isn&#8217;t a concept but a Person who steps in when no one else can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will Come</b><p>- The verb is active and certain. God promises not a possibility but an arrival.<p>&#8226; Isaiah had already foretold: &#8220;For unto us a Child is born&#8230;of the increase of His government&#8230;there will be no end&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Malachi echoed, &#8220;The Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to His temple&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Covenant records the fulfillment in Bethlehem (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>) and anticipates the future return: &#8220;This same Jesus&#8230;will come back&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s timeline often spans centuries, yet His Word stands unchanged (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Zion</b><p>- Zion refers to Jerusalem, the geographical and spiritual heart of God&#8217;s dealings with Israel (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>).<p>- Paul cites this very verse: &#8220;The Deliverer will come from Zion&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>), linking Christ&#8217;s salvation to Israel&#8217;s future restoration.<p>- Revelation completes the picture: &#8220;I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>).<p>- Zion thus becomes the stage where redemption&#8217;s promise and consummation meet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Those in Jacob</b><p>- &#8220;Jacob&#8221; emphasizes the covenant nation&#8212;physical descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10-12</a>).<p>- God always preserves a faithful remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). Paul clarifies, &#8220;Not all who are descended from Israel are Israel&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-8</a>); the Redeemer&#8217;s blessing is for covenant people who truly believe.<p>- The verse affirms God&#8217;s continuing commitment to Israel even while the gospel also reaches the nations (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who Turn from Transgression</b><p>- Redemption is applied to repentant hearts, not rebellious ones.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter preached, &#8220;Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; John assures believers, &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>- Repentance is both a change of mind and direction. The Redeemer&#8217;s arrival brings power to turn, yet each person must respond.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declares the LORD</b><p>- The closing phrase underscores divine authority. When the LORD speaks, His word is final (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- This declaration anchors every promise above; God Himself stakes His name on the Redeemer&#8217;s mission and its guaranteed outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a> promises that a personal Redeemer&#8212;Jesus Christ&#8212;will certainly arrive in Jerusalem, extending salvation to the covenant people of Israel who repent of their sins. The verse ties together God&#8217;s unbreakable covenant, the necessity of repentance, and the assured triumph of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, all sealed by the authoritative word of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/59.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And the Redeemer shall come . . .</span>--The picture of the Theophany is continued--Jehovah comes as a Redeemer (Goel, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm" title="But now thus said the LORD that created you, O Jacob, and he that formed you, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name; you are mine.">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a>) to the true Zion, to those who have turned from their transgression.
