"That day" often signifies the Day of the Lord, a time of judgment and salvation. It connects to prophetic literature where God&#8217;s ultimate plan is revealed, such as in <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>. It indicates a specific moment when God's promises come to fruition.<p><b>Surely this is our God</b><br>This declaration of recognition and affirmation highlights the fulfillment of God's promises. It echoes the Israelites' acknowledgment of God&#8217;s deliverance, similar to the song of Moses in <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. It emphasizes a personal relationship with God, affirming His identity and faithfulness.<p><b>We have waited for Him</b><br>The act of waiting signifies faith and hope in God's promises. It reflects the patience and endurance of believers, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-26</a> and <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. This waiting is not passive but active trust in God's timing and sovereignty.<p><b>And He has saved us</b><br>This statement celebrates deliverance and salvation, central themes in Isaiah. It points to God's redemptive work, both historically in Israel's deliverance and eschatologically in the ultimate salvation through Christ. It aligns with the messianic prophecies of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and the New Testament fulfillment in Jesus.<p><b>This is the LORD for whom we have waited</b><br>Reiterating the identity of the LORD, this phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people. It reflects the assurance and fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5-6</a>. The repetition emphasizes the certainty and joy of the awaited salvation.<p><b>Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation</b><br>This call to rejoice is a response to God's deliverance, a common theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>). It signifies the joy and gratitude of the redeemed, celebrating the victory and peace brought by God's salvation.

Isaiah has just described the swallowing up of death and the wiping away of tears (<a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7-8</a>), echoing promises fulfilled fully in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. The &#8220;day&#8221; anticipates Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>) and the consummation of His kingdom (<a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12-13</a>). Until then, believers live in confident expectation (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Surely this is our God;</b><p>A shout of recognition and relationship. The people claim Him as &#8220;our God,&#8221; echoing the covenant refrain first heard in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and running through <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a> and <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>. The certainty (&#8220;Surely&#8221;) contrasts with the world&#8217;s idols (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>); when the Lord appears, every doubt disappears (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we have waited for Him,</b><p>Waiting is active trust, not passive resignation. Saints throughout Scripture model it: Noah building an ark (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), Abraham awaiting Isaac (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>), Simeon expecting Messiah (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-32</a>). Waiting trains faith (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), refines hope (<a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-26</a>), and separates genuine worshipers from the impatient world (<a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He has saved us.</b><p>The completed rescue proves waiting was worthwhile. Isaiah earlier celebrated God as &#8220;my salvation&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>). Here salvation is both physical (deliverance from enemies, <a href="/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2-3</a>) and spiritual (removal of the shroud of death, <a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7-8</a>). Ultimately this points to Jesus&#8217; atoning work (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>) and His coming triumph (<a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the LORD for whom we have waited.</b><p>Repetition underscores personal devotion. &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH) identifies the covenant-keeping God revealed to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). The people testify that no substitute satisfied them during the waiting period (<a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1-2</a>). Their patience honors His timetable (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>) and showcases steadfast faith (<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.&#8221;</b><p>Joy erupts naturally when redemption is experienced (<a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1-3</a>). The double call&#8212;&#8220;rejoice&#8221; and &#8220;be glad&#8221;&#8212;mirrors <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>. Salvation generates communal celebration (<a href="/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6-7</a>) and personal praise (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>). Notice the focus: not our effort, but &#8220;His salvation&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Worship becomes the only fitting response (<a href="/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a> captures the climactic moment when God's people, having trusted His promises through long seasons of waiting, finally see His deliverance manifested. Recognizing Him as their own covenant God, they proclaim the certainty of His identity, celebrate the faith-refining value of waiting, witness the completeness of His salvation, and erupt in joyful worship. The verse invites believers today to cling confidently to the Lord, endure with hope, and anticipate the day when faith turns to sight and rejoicing is unending.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">It shall be said in that day.</span>--The speakers are obviously the company of the redeemed, the citizens of the new Jerusalem.
