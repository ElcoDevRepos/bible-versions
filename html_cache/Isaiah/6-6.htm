The altar from which he took the "live coal "--literally, <span class= "ital">stone, </span>and interpreted by some critics of the stones of which the altar was constructed--is commonly thought of as belonging, like that of <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm" title="And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.">Revelation 8:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>, to the heavenly Temple which was opened to the prophet's view. There seems, however, a deeper meaning in the symbolism if we think of the seraph as descending from the height above the throne to the altar of incense, near which Isaiah actually stood. It was from that altar that the glowing charcoal was taken. What had seemed part of the material of a formal worship became quickened with a living power. The symbol became sacramental. So in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>, the prayer of the penitent is "Purge me with hyssop"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>make the symbol a reality.
