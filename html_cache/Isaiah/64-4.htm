It suggests a continuity of God's presence and work throughout history. The reference to "ancient times" connects to the understanding of God as eternal, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God being from everlasting to everlasting.<p><b>no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen</b><br>This highlights the uniqueness and incomprehensibility of God. It echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>, where Paul speaks of the things God has prepared for those who love Him, which are beyond human understanding. The sensory language underscores the limitations of human perception in grasping the fullness of God's nature and works.<p><b>any God besides You</b><br>This affirms the monotheistic belief central to the faith, distinguishing the God of Israel from the idols and false gods of surrounding nations. It reflects the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This exclusivity is a recurring theme in Isaiah, emphasizing God's sovereignty and singularity.<p><b>who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's active involvement in the lives of His people, particularly those who demonstrate faith and patience. The concept of "waiting" implies trust and hope in God's timing and plans. This is seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>, which states, "The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him."
