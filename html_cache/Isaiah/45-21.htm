It reflects the courtroom imagery often used by the prophets, where God calls the nations to present their arguments and defend their idols. This setting emphasizes God's sovereignty and the futility of idol worship. The call to "take counsel together" suggests a gathering of wisdom and strength, yet it underscores the inability of these false gods to deliver or predict the future.<p><b>Who foretold this long ago?</b><br>This question highlights God's omniscience and His ability to declare the end from the beginning. It refers to the prophecies given through His prophets, which have consistently come to pass. This is a direct challenge to the idols, which cannot predict or influence future events. The rhetorical nature of the question points to God's unique ability to reveal His plans to humanity, as seen in the fulfillment of prophecies throughout the Bible.<p><b>Who announced it from ancient times?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity and reliability of God's word throughout history. It suggests that God's plans and purposes have been consistent and unchanging from the beginning. The reference to "ancient times" connects to the longstanding tradition of prophecy in Israel, where God communicated His will through chosen messengers. This continuity is a testament to God's faithfulness and the trustworthiness of His promises.<p><b>Was it not I, the LORD?</b><br>Here, God asserts His identity as the one true deity who has revealed His plans. The use of "I, the LORD" is a declaration of His covenant name, Yahweh, which signifies His eternal existence and unchanging nature. This assertion distinguishes Him from the powerless idols and reinforces His role as the sovereign ruler of the universe. It is a reminder of His personal involvement in the affairs of the world and His commitment to His people.<p><b>There is no other God but Me,</b><br>This statement is a clear declaration of monotheism, central to the faith of Israel. It underscores the exclusivity of God, rejecting the existence of any other deities. This theme is prevalent throughout the book of Isaiah, where God repeatedly affirms His unique status as the only true God. It serves as a call to reject idolatry and recognize the LORD as the sole object of worship and devotion.<p><b>a righteous God and Savior;</b><br>This phrase highlights two key attributes of God: His righteousness and His role as Savior. God's righteousness refers to His moral perfection and justice, ensuring that His actions are always right and fair. As Savior, God is the deliverer and redeemer of His people, providing salvation from sin and oppression. This dual role is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's righteousness and offers salvation to all who believe.<p><b>there is none but Me.</b><br>The repetition of this assertion reinforces the exclusivity of God and His unparalleled nature. It serves as a final affirmation of His supremacy over all creation. This statement is a call to recognize God's unique authority and to place trust solely in Him. It echoes the Shema, a central declaration of faith in Judaism, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Yahweh is declaring His unique sovereignty and role as the only true God and Savior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Implicit in the call to "present your case" are the nations and their idols, which are being challenged by God to prove their divinity and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is speaking, delivering a message of monotheism and divine sovereignty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_times.htm">Ancient Times</a></b><br>Refers to the historical context and the longstanding revelation of God&#8217;s plans and purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Though not mentioned explicitly in this verse, the context involves a contrast between the living God and the powerless idols of the nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize and affirm the sovereignty of God in all aspects of life.

(Comp. <a href="/psalms/85-10.htm" title="Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.">Psalm 85:10</a>.) In virtue of that union the invitation of <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm" title="Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:22</a> is addressed to all the ends of the world. The offer of salvation is universal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell ye, and bring them near</span>. Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne understand the nations to be addressed, and told to "show" or "announce," and "bring forth" or "produce," any argument in favour of the divinity of their gods. But it is simpler and better, with our translators, to regard the address as made to the prophets of God, who are bidden to announce his message of mercy to the nations, and to bring them near to him (comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them take counsel together</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the nations consider one with another, whether God or the idols be the fitter object of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath declared this?</span> "This" must refer to the conquest of Babylon and deliverance of Israel by Cyrus. None but Jehovah had ever announced this - none but he could bring it to pass<span class="cmt_word">. From ancient time</span>; rather, from <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (Cheyne). The announcement cannot have been made very long before this prophecy was delivered. <span class="cmt_word">A just God and a Saviour</span>. A God in whom "mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other" (Psalm 85:16); who can be at once just, "acting stringently according to the demands of his holiness" (Delitzsch), and yet design and effect the salvation of sinners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/45-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Speak up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and present your case&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
