Mount Zion, historically the location of the Jebusite fortress captured by David, became synonymous with Jerusalem and the spiritual center of Israel. The LORD's creation over Mount Zion signifies His presence and favor, reminiscent of His covenant with David and the establishment of Jerusalem as the holy city. This also foreshadows the eschatological hope of a renewed Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<p><b>and over her assemblies</b><br>The term "assemblies" refers to the gatherings of God's people, possibly indicating both the physical gatherings for worship and the spiritual community of believers. This reflects the communal aspect of worship in ancient Israel, where the temple served as the focal point for religious life. The protection and presence of God over these assemblies highlight His role as the protector and leader of His people, ensuring their safety and unity.<p><b>a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night</b><br>This imagery directly recalls the Exodus narrative, where God led the Israelites through the wilderness with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). It symbolizes God's guidance, protection, and presence. The cloud and fire also represent the Shekinah glory, the visible manifestation of God's presence. This connection underscores God's faithfulness and His continuous guidance of His people throughout history.<p><b>For over all the glory there will be a canopy</b><br>The "glory" refers to the divine presence and majesty of God. The canopy, or "covering," suggests protection and shelter, akin to a bridal canopy (chuppah) in Jewish tradition, symbolizing God's covenant relationship with His people. This imagery points to a future time of peace and divine protection, where God's presence will be fully realized among His people, echoing the prophetic visions of a restored and glorified Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, Yahweh, who is the central figure in this prophecy, promising protection and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_zion.htm">Mount Zion</a></b><br>A significant hill in Jerusalem, symbolizing the city of God and His people, often representing the spiritual center of God's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/her_assemblies.htm">Her Assemblies</a></b><br>Refers to the gatherings of God's people, the community of believers who worship and serve Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloud_of_smoke_by_day_and_glowing_flame_of_fire_by_night.htm">Cloud of Smoke by Day and Glowing Flame of Fire by Night</a></b><br>These are symbols of God's presence and guidance, reminiscent of the Exodus when God led the Israelites through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canopy.htm">Canopy</a></b><br>A protective covering, symbolizing God's sheltering presence over His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_guidance.htm">God's Presence and Guidance</a></b><br>Just as God guided the Israelites with a cloud and fire, He continues to guide us today through His Word and Spirit.

It symbolized guidance, shade, and the continual presence of the LORD.<p>&#8226; Practically, a cloud shields from the scorching sun (<a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5-6</a>).

The verse looks back to the wilderness pillar, speaks to the believer&#8217;s present assurance of Christ&#8217;s nearness, and looks ahead to the eternal dwelling of God with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And the Lord will create </span>. . .--The verb "create" has all the solemn force with which we find it in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>. It is one of Isaiah's favourite words. The word for "dwelling-place" is almost invariably used for the tabernacle or temple, and would seem to have that meaning here. This determines the character of the "assemblies." They are not the meetings of the people for counsel or debate, as in a Greek <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>but their "gatherings," their "solemn assemblies," in the courts of the temple. The thoughts of the prophet travel back to the history of the Exodus, when the presence of Jehovah was manifested as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-14.htm" title="And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.">Numbers 14:14</a>). In that Presence there would be safety and peace. The image is a favourite one with Isaiah, possibly as connected with the vision of <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>, for God's protection of His people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon every dwelling-place</span> ("over the whole habitation," Revised Version). Mr. Cheyne translates "upon the whole site," and takes the "site" to be especially the temple. <span class="accented">Makon</span> seems certainly never to be used for anything but "God's dwelling-place" (<a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13, 39</a>, etc.; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-2.htm">2 Chronicles 6:2, 30</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-14.htm">Psalm 33:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>). Perhaps, however, <span class="accented">every</span> dwelling-place of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every Christian Church, is intended. On these, and on all Christian assemblies, there will rest a new presence of God - one which he will have "created;" recalling that of the pillar of fire and of cloud which rested in the wilderness on the Jewish tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">A cloud and smoke by day</span>.
