In the context of <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, this is directed towards Shebna, a steward or high official in the royal court of Judah. The removal signifies God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to depose leaders who do not align with His will. This act of removal is consistent with other biblical instances where God deposes leaders, such as Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>. It underscores the biblical principle that leadership is a stewardship accountable to God.<p><b>and you will be ousted from your position</b><br>The ousting from position further emphasizes the totality of the judgment. It is not merely a demotion but a complete removal from power. This reflects the seriousness of Shebna's offense, which is implied to be pride and self-aggrandizement, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a> where he builds a grand tomb for himself. The cultural context of the time placed great importance on burial practices, and Shebna's actions suggest a focus on personal legacy over service to God and His people. This removal can be seen as a type of Christ's teaching in <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>, where those who exalt themselves will be humbled.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shebna.htm">Shebna</a></b><br>The steward or treasurer of the palace in Jerusalem, who is the subject of God's judgment in this passage.
