Historically, this reflects the period of the Babylonian exile and the subsequent return under Persian rule, where foreign kings like Cyrus played a role in the restoration of Israel (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). It also foreshadows the future Messianic kingdom where earthly rulers will acknowledge the sovereignty of God and His people.<p><b>and their queens your nursing mothers</b><br>Queens, often seen as figures of nurturing and care, will provide sustenance and support. This imagery suggests a complete transformation in the relationship between Israel and the nations, where those who were once oppressors become caretakers. It highlights the nurturing role of Gentile nations in the restoration and growth of Israel, as seen in the support given by Persian queens like Esther.<p><b>They will bow to you facedown and lick the dust at your feet</b><br>This phrase signifies total submission and reverence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bowing facedown and licking the dust were acts of deep humility and acknowledgment of superiority. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a> and <a href="/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>, where nations submit to God's chosen people. It points to the ultimate victory and vindication of God's people in the eschatological future.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This statement emphasizes the recognition of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout the Bible, knowing the LORD is associated with experiencing His power and deliverance (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This knowledge comes through witnessing God's promises fulfilled, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>those who hope in Me will never be put to shame</b><br>This assurance is a recurring theme in scripture, affirming that trust in God leads to vindication and honor (<a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>, <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>). It contrasts the temporary shame of exile with the eternal honor of restoration.
