Moab, a nation east of Israel, frequently engaged in idolatrous practices at these sites. The high places were typically associated with the worship of deities like Chemosh, the national god of Moab. This phrase indicates Moab's reliance on pagan rituals and false gods, contrasting with the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel. The use of high places was condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), highlighting the spiritual apostasy of Moab.<p><b>when he wearies himself</b><br>This suggests a fervent but ultimately futile effort in religious practices. The weariness implies a sense of desperation or intense exertion in seeking divine favor or intervention. In the context of Moab, it reflects the nation's reliance on human effort and ritualistic practices rather than true faith or repentance. This can be contrasted with the biblical teaching that true rest and salvation come from God alone (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>and enters his sanctuary to pray</b><br>The sanctuary here refers to a sacred place dedicated to Moab's gods, likely a temple of Chemosh. Entering the sanctuary to pray indicates a formal act of worship and supplication. However, the act is portrayed as ineffective, highlighting the impotence of false gods. This contrasts with the biblical understanding of prayer as a powerful means of communication with the one true God (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>it will do him no good</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of Moab's religious practices. Despite their efforts, their prayers and rituals are ineffective because they are directed toward false gods. This serves as a warning against idolatry and a reminder of the sovereignty of the God of Israel, who alone can answer prayer and provide deliverance. The ineffectiveness of Moab's worship is a fulfillment of prophetic judgment, as seen in other parts of Isaiah and the prophets, where reliance on anything other than God leads to downfall (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Yet the Lord has already declared, &#8220;You shall destroy all their high places&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>). Centuries later He repeats the warning: &#8220;All the nations&#8217; gods are idols&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>). The scene in <a href="/isaiah/16-12.htm">Isaiah 16:12</a> shows Moab still trusting the very locations God condemns, illustrating stubborn allegiance to false worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he wearies himself</b><p>Isaiah sketches a frantic devotee who keeps going until exhaustion sets in. The prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel did the same&#8212;&#8220;they leaped about the altar&#8230; but there was no voice, no one answered&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26&#8211;29</a>). Isaiah earlier lamented, &#8220;You were wearied by your many intrigues&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>). Human effort, however intense, cannot secure divine favor when directed toward an idol. The more Moab strains, the more obvious the futility becomes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And enters his sanctuary to pray</b><p>Now the worshiper moves indoors, into Chemosh&#8217;s temple, expecting greater effectiveness. Jeremiah later echoes Isaiah, &#8220;Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-13.htm">Jeremiah 48:13</a>). Contrast this with the true sanctuary in Jerusalem, where God promised, &#8220;My eyes and My heart will be there for all days&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>). By showing Moab in its own &#8220;sanctuary,&#8221; Isaiah highlights a counterfeit refuge standing in opposition to the Lord&#8217;s chosen dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will do him no good</b><p>The verse finishes with a blunt verdict: all that climbing, labor, and pleading &#8220;will do him no good.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4&#8211;8</a> reminds us why&#8212;idols &#8220;have mouths, but cannot speak&#8230; those who make them become like them.&#8221; When judgment comes, &#8220;they will cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not save them at all&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>).
