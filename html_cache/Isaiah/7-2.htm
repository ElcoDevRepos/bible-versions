This phrase underscores the political and spiritual significance of the Davidic line, which is central to the messianic expectations fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>that Aram was in league with Ephraim</b><br>Aram, also known as Syria, was a neighboring kingdom often in conflict with Israel. Ephraim represents the northern kingdom of Israel, named after its dominant tribe. The alliance between Aram and Ephraim posed a significant threat to Judah, the southern kingdom, where the house of David ruled. This coalition aimed to dethrone Ahaz and replace him with a puppet king (<a href="/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), highlighting the political instability and the looming danger faced by Judah.<p><b>the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled</b><br>Ahaz, the king of Judah, was known for his lack of faith and reliance on foreign alliances rather than trusting in God (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>). The fear experienced by Ahaz and his people reflects their spiritual state and the dire circumstances they faced. This trembling indicates a lack of trust in God's promises to protect the Davidic line, contrasting with the faith shown by previous kings like David.<p><b>like trees in the forest shaken by the wind</b><br>This simile vividly describes the fear and instability felt by Ahaz and the people of Judah. The imagery of trees shaken by the wind conveys a sense of vulnerability and helplessness. Biblically, wind often symbolizes divine intervention or judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11-12</a>), suggesting that the fear experienced by Judah was not only due to the political threat but also a spiritual crisis. This sets the stage for God's reassurance through the prophecy of Immanuel (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who brings peace and stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>Refers to the royal lineage of King David, representing the kingdom of Judah.

The contrast between God&#8217;s enduring promise to David&#8217;s line and the current king&#8217;s unfaithfulness heightens the drama of the moment.<p>&#8226; Similar moments of royal peril occur in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1&#8211;3</a>, where Jehoshaphat seeks the Lord in crisis. The report here exposes whether Ahaz will trust the covenant-keeping God or react in fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Aram was in league with Ephraim</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;that Aram was in league with Ephraim&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Aram (Syria) under Rezin and Ephraim (the northern kingdom, Israel) under Pekah formed a military alliance to coerce Judah into joining a rebellion against Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; 16:5).<p>&#8226; Scripture often warns against ungodly alliances (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>). Judah is now threatened precisely because neighboring kingdoms are banding together apart from God&#8217;s will.<p>&#8226; The alliance fulfills earlier warnings that judgment would fall when God&#8217;s people rejected Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). Isaiah later affirms that these enemies, though frightening, will not ultimately prevail (<a href="/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Fear grips both king and populace; leadership&#8217;s anxiety spreads to the nation (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their trembling exposes a failure to rest in God&#8217;s promises. Contrast with David facing Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>) or Hezekiah facing Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s mission in the following verses is to call Ahaz from fear to faith (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>), showing God still offers grace even to a wavering king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like trees in the forest shaken by the wind</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The simile paints uncontrolled, widespread panic&#8212;an image echoed in <a href="/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>.<p>&#8226; Wind often symbolizes divine judgment or testing (<a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11&#8211;12</a>). The shaking here previews the shaking God will do among nations (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33&#8211;34</a>), yet Judah is shaking before God has even acted, proving their instability.<p>&#8226; When God&#8217;s people are anchored in Him, they are instead compared to trees firmly planted (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7&#8211;8</a>). The contrast invites Judah&#8212;and readers today&#8212;to move from swaying fear to rooted faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a> records Judah&#8217;s reaction when the Syrian-Israeli coalition threatens Jerusalem. Though heirs of David&#8217;s unbreakable covenant, King Ahaz and his people quake, revealing misplaced trust. The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s call through Isaiah: &#8220;Be calm, do not fear&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). Their trembling like wind-shaken trees contrasts sharply with the stability promised to those who rely on the Lord. The lesson endures: external threats expose internal faith; God invites His people to stand firm on His sure promises rather than be swept away by fear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Syria is confederate with Ephraim.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">rests upon </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> Ephraim stands, of course, as often elsewhere, for the northern kingdom of Israel as a whole.<p><span class= "bld">His heart was moved.</span>--There was a general panic. King and people alike asked, How could they resist? Would it not be better to join the confederacy, and take their chance with it in attacking the king of Assyria? The image of the trees is generic, but suggests something like the quivering of the aspen leaves.<p>(2) The other interpretation sets out from an entirely different starting-point. The words of <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a> are taken as, once for all, deciding the entire meaning of the Immanuel prophecy. The prophet is supposed to have passed into a state of ecstasy in which he sees clearly, and with a full consciousness of its meaning, the history of the incarnation and the marvel of the travail-pangs of the Virgin mother. The vision of the future Christ thus presented to his mind, colours all his after-thoughts, and forms the basis of his whole work. The article emphasises the definiteness of his visions. He sees "<span class= "ital">the </span>virgin mother" of the far-off future. And the prophet learns to connect the vision with the history of his own time. The growth of that Christ-child in the far-off future serves as a measure of time for the events that were passing, or about to pass, within the horizon of his earthly vision. Before the end of an interval not longer than that which separates youth from manhood, the Syro-Ephraiminitic confederacy should be broken up. So far, here also, we have a coherent and consistent view. It is attended, however, by some serious difficulties. A "sign," in the language of Hebrew prophets, is that which proves to the person to whom it is offered that there is a supernatural power working with him who gives it. If a prediction, it is one which will speedily be tested by a personal experience, the very offer of which implies in the prophet the certainty of its fulfilment. He stakes, as it were, his reputation as a prophet on the issue. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/37-30.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such as grows of itself; and the second year that which springs of the same: and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.">Isaiah 37:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-7.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;">Isaiah 38:7</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/4-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.">Exodus 4:8-14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-16.htm" title="Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.">1Samuel 12:16</a>.) But how could the prediction of a birth in the far-off distance, divided by several centuries from Isaiah's time, be a sign to Ahaz or his people? And what would be the meaning, we may ask again, of the words "butter and honey shall he eat," as applied to the Christ-child? Do not the words "Before the child shall know to refuse the evil <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" point, not to a child seen as afar in vision, but to one who was to be born and grow up among the men of that generation? Should we not have expected, if the words had implied a clear revelation of the mystery of the virgin-birth, that Isaiah himself would have dwelt upon it elsewhere, that later prophets would have named it as one of the notes of the Messiah, that it would have become a tradition of the Jewish schools of interpretation? As a matter of fact, no such allusion is found in Isaiah, nor in the prophets that follow him (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/31-22.htm" title="How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter? for the LORD has created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.">Jeremiah 31:22</a>, for the only supposed, one cannot say even "apparent," exception); the Jewish interpreters never include this among their notes of the Christ. It is indeed, as has been said in the New Testament portion of this <span class= "ital">Commentary, </span>one of the strongest arguments for the historical, non-mythical character of the series of events in Matthew 1, Luke 1, 2, that they were contrary to prevailing expectation. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was told the house of David</span>.

Under ordinary circumstances the kingdoms of Syria and Israel were hostile the one to the other (see <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3-36</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3, 22, 25</a>). But occasionally, under the pressure of a great danger, the relations were changed, and a temporary league was formed. The inscriptions of Shalmaneser II. show such a league to have existed in the time of Benhadad II. and Ahab ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. pp. 103, 104). The invasion of Pul, and the threatening attitude of Tiglath-Pileser. It had now once more drown the two countries together. On the use of the word "Ephraim" to designate the kingdom of Israel, see Hosea, <span class="accented">passim</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>His heart was moved</span>; or, <span class="accented">shook</span>. If the two kings had each been able separately to inflict on him such loss (see the introductory paragraph), what must he not expect, now that both were about to attack him together? It is not clear whether Ahuz had as yet applied to Assyria for help or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When it became known</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
