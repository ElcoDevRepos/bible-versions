In the context of <a href="/isaiah/17.htm">Isaiah 17</a>, it refers to the aftermath of judgment upon Damascus and Israel. The concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing hope and the preservation of God's people despite widespread devastation. This idea is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, where a remnant of Israel returns to the mighty God. Theologically, it underscores God's mercy and faithfulness to His covenant, ensuring that a faithful few will survive to continue His purposes.<p><b>like an olive tree that has been beaten</b><br>The imagery of an olive tree being beaten is drawn from the agricultural practice of harvesting olives by striking the branches to make the fruit fall. This metaphor illustrates the thoroughness of the judgment, leaving only a small amount behind. Olive trees were a significant part of the ancient Near Eastern economy, symbolizing prosperity and blessing. The beating of the tree signifies a stripping away of abundance, leaving only what is necessary for survival. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's discipline, where He removes excess to purify and refine His people.<p><b>two or three berries atop the tree</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the scarcity of what remains after judgment. The "two or three berries" represent the small, seemingly insignificant remnant that survives. In biblical numerology, the numbers two and three can signify witness and divine completeness, respectively. This remnant, though small, serves as a witness to God's ongoing work and faithfulness. It also reflects the idea that God often works through a faithful few, as seen in the stories of Noah, Gideon, and the early church.<p><b>four or five on its fruitful branches</b><br>The mention of "four or five" berries on the branches further highlights the limited nature of what remains. The numbers four and five can symbolize universality and grace, respectively. This suggests that even in judgment, God's grace is present, preserving a remnant for His purposes. The fruitful branches indicate that despite the reduction, there is still potential for future growth and restoration. This aligns with the biblical theme of hope and renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where a shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse.<p><b>declares the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority and sovereignty of God over the events described. The use of "declares" indicates a prophetic pronouncement, emphasizing that the message comes directly from God. Referring to God as "the God of Israel" reinforces His covenant relationship with His people and His commitment to their ultimate redemption. This title also serves as a reminder of God's historical acts of deliverance and judgment, as seen throughout the Old Testament. It assures the audience that the prophecy is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree that will surely come to pass.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Even so, the verse opens with a bright word, &#8220;Yet,&#8221; signaling God&#8217;s mercy that pierces the darkness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gleanings&#8221; recall the practice of leaving leftovers in the field (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). In harvest language, God always leaves something behind for life to continue.<p>&#8226; The remnant principle surfaces repeatedly: &#8220;Unless the LORD of Hosts had left us a few survivors&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>), and &#8220;So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Literal, devastating loss is coming, but not annihilation. God&#8217;s covenant promises to Israel remain intact because He keeps a remnant alive (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like an olive tree that has been beaten</b><p>&#8226; In ancient Israel olives were harvested by &#8220;beating&#8221; the branches (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-20.htm">Deuteronomy 24:20</a>). The image is an exact picture of chastening: the tree survives, the fruit is stripped.<p>&#8226; Judgment is purposeful, not vindictive. As with pruning (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>), beating the olive brings what is valuable to light and prepares the tree for more fruit in the future.<p>&#8226; The comparison roots the prophecy in everyday life; everyone had seen battered trees still standing, illustrating how Israel would look after Assyria&#8217;s invasion&#8212;shaken, but not uprooted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two or three berries atop the tree</b><p>&#8226; The topmost branches often held a few olives that were too high to reach. Likewise, only a tiny number of people will escape (see <a href="/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1</a> for similar scarcity language).<p>&#8226; Height suggests visibility and vulnerability; the survivors are unmistakable evidence of God&#8217;s sparing hand.<p>&#8226; Jesus later alludes to the principle when He says the days of tribulation are &#8220;cut short for the sake of the elect&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-19.htm">Mark 13:19-20</a>). God always counts and protects His own, even when they are few.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>four or five on its fruitful branches</b><p>&#8226; The wording underscores how shockingly small the remnant is&#8212;&#8220;four or five&#8221; on branches that used to teem with olives. <a href="/amos/5-3.htm">Amos 5:3</a> parallels this: a thousand soldiers become one hundred, a hundred become ten.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fruitful branches&#8221; hints that the tree&#8217;s best parts were hit hardest; nevertheless, fruit still clings. In the same way, even the tribes most decimated by invasion will preserve a thread of lineage and faith.<p>&#8226; The picture of lingering fruit testifies to future hope. What remains can sprout again; God&#8217;s story with Israel is not finished (<a href="/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD, the God of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The divine signature guarantees fulfillment: &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;God of Israel&#8221; reminds the covenant people that the One bringing judgment is also the One who chose, loves, and will restore them.<p>&#8226; His word endures beyond the devastation: &#8220;The word of our God stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). The remnant&#8217;s survival hinges on that unbreakable word, not on human resilience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> paints a vivid, literal scene: an olive tree stripped by harvesters, yet a handful of berries remain. God uses this everyday picture to explain how, after severe judgment on Damascus and Northern Israel, a small remnant will survive. The verse affirms God&#8217;s dual nature in judgment and mercy: He beats the tree, but He also preserves it. The scattered few&#8212;whether &#8220;two or three&#8221; or &#8220;four or five&#8221;&#8212;prove His covenant faithfulness and become the seed for future restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it.</span>--The idea of the "remnant" is still in the prophet's thoughts, even in the case of the northern kingdom.
