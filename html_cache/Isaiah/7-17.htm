The "you" refers to King Ahaz of Judah, and "your people" refers to the people of Judah. The "house of your father" signifies the Davidic dynasty, which Ahaz belongs to. This judgment is a consequence of Ahaz's lack of faith and reliance on foreign alliances rather than trusting in God. Historically, this period was marked by political instability and threats from surrounding nations, particularly Israel (Ephraim) and Syria. Theologically, it underscores the covenant relationship between God and the Davidic line, highlighting the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>a time unlike any since the day Ephraim separated from Judah</b><br>This phrase refers to the division of the united monarchy of Israel after the reign of Solomon, when the ten northern tribes, led by Ephraim, broke away to form the kingdom of Israel, leaving Judah and Benjamin as the southern kingdom. This division is recorded in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>. The separation was a significant event in Israel's history, leading to political and spiritual decline. The prophecy suggests that the coming judgment will be as momentous and devastating as that historical split, emphasizing the severity of the impending crisis.<p><b>He will bring the king of Assyria.</b><br>The king of Assyria represents the instrument of God's judgment. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and expansionist policies during the 8th century BC. The Assyrian kings, such as Tiglath-Pileser III and Sennacherib, were known for their campaigns against Israel and Judah. This prophecy was fulfilled when Assyria invaded the region, leading to the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel and significant threats to Judah. Theologically, this highlights God's sovereignty over nations and His use of foreign powers to accomplish His purposes. It also foreshadows the need for a faithful and righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would deliver His people not through political alliances but through divine intervention and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign and orchestrates events according to His divine plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/you_and_your_people.htm">You and your people</a></b><br>Refers to King Ahaz and the people of Judah, who are being addressed by the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_your_father.htm">The house of your father</a></b><br>This refers to the royal lineage of David, to which King Ahaz belongs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, which had separated from Judah after Solomon's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_assyria.htm">The king of Assyria</a></b><br>A foreign ruler who would become an instrument of God's judgment against Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God uses nations and rulers as instruments of His judgment.

He was bent on calling in the help of the king of Assyria. Isaiah warns him (reserving the name of the king, with all the emphasis of suddenness, for the close of his sentence) that by so doing he is bringing on himself a more formidable invasion than that of Syria and Ephraim, worse than any that had been known since the separation of the two kingdoms (we note the use of the event as a chronological era), than that of Shishak under Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,">2Chronicles 12:2</a>), or Zerah (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>), or of Baasha under Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a>), or of the Moabites and Ammonites under Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2Chronicles 20:1</a>), or of the Philistines and Arabians under Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:">2Chronicles 21:16</a>).

The perversity of Ahaz, already rebuked in ver. 13, is further punished by a threat, that upon him, and upon his people, and upon his father's house, shall come shortly a dire calamity. The very power whose aid he is himself bent on invoking shall be the scourge to chastise both king and people (vers. 17-20). The land shall be made bare as by a razor (ver. 20). Cultivation shall cease; its scant inhabitants will support themselves by keeping a few cows and sheep (ver. 21), and will nourish themselves on dairy produce, and the honey that the wild bees produce (ver. 22).

The construction is awkward, since "the King of Assyria' cannot well stand in apposition with "days." Hence many take the words for a gloss that has been accidentally intruded into the text (Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Cheyne). Others, however, see in the grammatical anomaly a grace of composition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1431;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
