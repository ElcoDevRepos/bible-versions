Hail is frequently associated with God's power and wrath, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18-26</a>) and the apocalyptic visions in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>). The forest may symbolize pride and human achievement, which God can easily bring low. In the context of Isaiah, this could refer to the Assyrian army or other nations that oppose God's people, indicating that no matter how formidable they appear, they are vulnerable to God's judgment.<p><b>and the city will sink to the depths</b><br>The city likely represents human civilization and its structures, which are subject to God's sovereign will. This imagery of sinking suggests total destruction or humiliation, akin to the fate of Babylon (Isaiah 13-14) or Tyre (Ezekiel 26). It may also foreshadow the ultimate downfall of earthly powers in the eschatological future, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a> with the fall of Babylon the Great.

Of such a judgment "hail" was the natural symbol. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm" title="And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.">Ezekiel 13:13</a>.) The "forest" stands in the symbolism of prophecy for the rulers and princes of any kingdom, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm" title="And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.">Isaiah 10:34</a> for those of Assyria, and here probably of Judah. Not a few commentators refer the words here also to Assyria, but the city that follows is clearly Jerusalem, and the interpretation given above harmonises accordingly better with the context. Of that city Isaiah says that it shall be "brought down to a low estate," its pride humbled even to the ground, in order that it may afterwards be exalted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but it shall hail in the coming down</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the destruction) <span class="accented">of the forest</span>. "The forest" has commonly been regarded as Assyria, on the strength of <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>.
