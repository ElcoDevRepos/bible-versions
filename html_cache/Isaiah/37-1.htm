The Assyrian army, led by King Sennacherib, had already conquered many cities in Judah and was now threatening Jerusalem. This report would have been alarming, as the Assyrians were known for their military might and brutality. The context is found in the preceding chapters, where the Assyrian Rabshakeh delivers a message of intimidation to Jerusalem.<p><b>King Hezekiah</b><br>Hezekiah was the 13th king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and religious reforms, including the removal of high places and the destruction of idols. His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat is a pivotal moment in his reign, showcasing his reliance on God rather than political alliances or military strength.<p><b>tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes was a traditional expression of grief, distress, or repentance in ancient Israel. This act signified Hezekiah's deep anguish and humility in the face of the Assyrian threat. It is a common biblical motif seen in other instances, such as when Jacob believed Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>) and when Job faced his trials (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>).<p><b>put on sackcloth</b><br>Sackcloth was a coarse material, often made from goat's hair, worn as a sign of mourning or penitence. By donning sackcloth, Hezekiah demonstrated his humility and repentance before God, seeking divine intervention. This act is consistent with other biblical figures who sought God's mercy, such as the people of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>and entered the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Hezekiah's decision to enter the temple signifies his turning to God in prayer and supplication during a national crisis. This action underscores the importance of seeking God's presence and guidance in times of trouble, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4-5</a>. The temple was not only a place of sacrifice but also a symbol of God's dwelling among His people, making it the appropriate place for Hezekiah to seek divine help.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during a time of great crisis, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sackcloth.htm">Sackcloth</a></b><br>A coarse material worn as a sign of mourning or repentance, symbolizing humility and penitence before God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites and the dwelling place of God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrian_threat.htm">The Assyrian Threat</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the impending invasion by the Assyrian army, led by King Sennacherib, which posed a significant threat to Jerusalem and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Isaiah plays a crucial role in the account as God's messenger, providing guidance and assurance to Hezekiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_crisis.htm">Humility in Crisis</a></b><br>Hezekiah's tearing of clothes and wearing sackcloth demonstrate a posture of humility and dependence on God during times of crisis.

In our lives, we should make it a priority to seek God's presence, especially in difficult times, through prayer and worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_faith.htm">Repentance and Faith</a></b><br>The act of wearing sackcloth is a sign of repentance.
