Historically, this is often interpreted as a reference to Cyrus the Great of Persia, who conquered Babylon and allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem. The "north" could refer to the direction from which Cyrus approached Babylon, as he came from the region of Media, which is north of Babylon. This demonstrates God's control over nations and history, fulfilling His purposes through chosen instruments.<p><b>one from the east who calls on My name.</b><br>The "east" further identifies the region associated with Cyrus, as Persia is located to the east of Babylon. Cyrus is notable for his decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>. This act aligns with calling on God's name, as it facilitated the restoration of worship in Jerusalem. Cyrus, though a pagan king, is used by God to fulfill His promises to Israel, illustrating how God can use anyone to accomplish His divine will.<p><b>He will march over rulers as if they were mortar,</b><br>This imagery of marching over rulers like mortar suggests ease and dominance. Mortar is a substance used in construction, easily manipulated and shaped. This indicates the effortless nature of Cyrus's conquests, as he subdued powerful kingdoms with remarkable swiftness. It reflects the idea that earthly powers are insignificant before God's chosen instrument, emphasizing God's ultimate authority over all rulers and nations.<p><b>like a potter who treads the clay.</b><br>The potter and clay metaphor is a common biblical image illustrating God's sovereignty and creative power (see <a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>). Just as a potter shapes clay according to his will, God shapes history and nations. This phrase underscores the ease with which Cyrus will accomplish his conquests, as well as the divine authority behind his actions. It also serves as a reminder of God's role as the ultimate creator and shaper of events, reinforcing the theme of divine sovereignty throughout the passage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_raised_up.htm">The One Raised Up</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as Cyrus the Great, the Persian king who conquered Babylon and allowed the Israelites to return to Jerusalem.

He adduces, as proof of his power in action, the fact of his raising up Cyrus; as proof of his ability to predict, the fact that he has announced his coming. <span class="cmt_word">One from the north... from the rising of the sun</span>. Both as a Persian, and as King of Elam, Cyrus might be considered to come from the east. In fact, however, when he attacked Babylon, he fell upon it mainly from the north. After his conquest of Astyages (Istivegu), he made Ecbatana his capital (Herod., 1:153); and it was from this comparatively northern city that he directed his attack upon Nabonidus. His march lay by way of Arbela ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 159) and Sippara (ibid., p. 165), through the district called Akkad to the Chaldean capital. Herodotus agrees with the monuments in bringing him to Babylon from the north. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he call upon my Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">shall he. proclaim my</span> Name.

Recent discoveries have raised the suspicion that Cyrus was a eyncretist, who was willing to accept the chief god of any nation as identical with his own Ormuzd. But it is to be borne in 'mind that the document which has produced this impression is one issued by the priestly authorities of Babylon in their own language, and may have been quite unknown to the Persian court. Cyrus may have been a better Zoroastrian than he is represented by the priests of Merodach. The Zoroastrian religion was, as Delitzsch observes, "nearest to the Jewish religion of all the systems of heathenism" (see . Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 93-117; and comp. Pusey, 'Lectures on Daniel,' pp. 530-550). <span class="cmt_word">He shall come upon princes as upon mortar</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall tread them underfoot, mortar being commonly mixed with the feet, as was also clay for bricks and pottery (Herod., 2:36).
