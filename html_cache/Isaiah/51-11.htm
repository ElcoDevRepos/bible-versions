The term "redeemed" signifies those who have been bought back or delivered by God, highlighting His role as a redeemer. This echoes the Exodus narrative where God redeemed Israel from Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who redeems believers from sin.<p><b>and enter Zion with singing</b><br>Zion is a term often used for Jerusalem, the city of God. Entering Zion with singing indicates a triumphant and joyful return, reminiscent of the Psalms of Ascent (Psalms 120-134) sung by pilgrims going to Jerusalem. This imagery also points to the eschatological hope of entering the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where believers will eternally dwell with God.<p><b>crowned with everlasting joy</b><br>The crown symbolizes honor and victory. Everlasting joy suggests a joy that is not temporary but eternal, reflecting the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises. This joy is a result of God's salvation and is a theme found throughout the prophetic literature, pointing to the Messianic age when Christ will reign.<p><b>Gladness and joy will overtake them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the overwhelming nature of the joy that the redeemed will experience. It suggests a complete transformation from their previous state of suffering and exile. The language here is reminiscent of the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>), where joy is a key characteristic of a life transformed by God.<p><b>and sorrow and sighing will flee</b><br>Sorrow and sighing represent the pain and suffering experienced by the Israelites during their exile. The promise that these will flee indicates a total reversal of their circumstances. This is a common prophetic theme, where God promises to turn mourning into joy (<a href="/jeremiah/31-13.htm">Jeremiah 31:13</a>). It also points to the ultimate hope in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God will wipe away every tear, and there will be no more death or mourning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_redeemed_of_the_lord.htm">The Redeemed of the LORD</a></b><br>This refers to those whom God has delivered or saved. In the context of Isaiah, it often points to the Israelites who are promised deliverance from exile, but it also has a broader application to all believers who are redeemed by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term that originally referred to a specific hill in Jerusalem, Zion came to symbolize the city itself and, more broadly, the people of God. It represents a place of divine presence and ultimate restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/singing_and_joy.htm">Singing and Joy</a></b><br>These are expressions of worship and celebration. In the context of Isaiah, they signify the response of the redeemed to God's salvation and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sorrow_and_sighing.htm">Sorrow and Sighing</a></b><br>These represent the suffering and lamentation experienced by the people, which will be replaced by joy and gladness upon their return to Zion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_redemption.htm">The Certainty of Redemption</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in God's promise of redemption. Just as the Israelites were assured of their return to Zion, Christians are assured of their ultimate salvation through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_salvation.htm">The Joy of Salvation</a></b><br>The joy and gladness described in <a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> should characterize the life of a believer. This joy is not dependent on circumstances but is rooted in the assurance of God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_of_sorrow.htm">Transformation of Sorrow</a></b><br>The promise that sorrow and sighing will flee is a powerful reminder that God is in the business of transforming our pain into joy. This transformation is both a present reality and a future hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response.htm">Worship as a Response</a></b><br>The singing and joy of the redeemed highlight the importance of worship as a response to God's work in our lives.

Redemption is the divine transaction that frees His people from bondage. Think of <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a> where God says, &#8220;I will redeem you with an outstretched arm,&#8221; or <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> which echoes this very verse. In the New Covenant, <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a> anchors the thought: &#8220;In Him we have redemption through His blood.&#8221; Whether Old Testament saints awaiting deliverance or believers today resting in Christ&#8217;s finished work (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>), the redeemed belong to God because He paid the price.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will return</b><p>- &#8220;...will return...&#8221; The prophecy first pictures Israel&#8217;s literal homecoming from Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/31-16.htm">Jeremiah 31:16-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>).

Paul even calls his converts &#8220;our crown of rejoicing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), underscoring the permanence of gospel-born gladness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gladness and joy will overtake them</b><p>- &#8220;Gladness and joy will overtake them...&#8221; God&#8217;s blessings don&#8217;t merely accompany His people; they run them down and surround them (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a> pictures mountains and hills bursting into song as His people go out with joy.
