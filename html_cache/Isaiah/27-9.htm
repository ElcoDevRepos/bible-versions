The concept of atonement is central to the Old Testament sacrificial system, where the shedding of blood was required for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This atonement foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides the final atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). The use of "Jacob" signifies the entire nation of Israel, emphasizing God's covenant relationship with His people despite their transgressions.<p><b>and the full fruit of the removal of his sin will be this:</b><br>The "full fruit" suggests a complete and transformative result of sin's removal, indicating not just forgiveness but also a change in behavior and worship practices. This transformation is a theme throughout the prophetic books, where true repentance leads to a return to God and His ways (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>). The removal of sin is not only a spiritual cleansing but also has tangible effects on the community and its practices.<p><b>When he makes all the altar stones like crushed bits of chalk,</b><br>This imagery of altar stones being crushed signifies the destruction of idolatrous practices. In ancient Israel, altars were often built for the worship of foreign gods, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The comparison to "crushed bits of chalk" implies total obliteration, leaving no trace of the former idolatry. This act of destroying altars is a physical demonstration of repentance and a return to the worship of Yahweh alone.<p><b>no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often erected alongside altars to Baal. Incense altars were used in various religious rituals, including those not sanctioned by God. The removal of these objects represents a purging of idolatry from the land, aligning with the first commandment to have no other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This cleansing is a necessary step for Israel to restore their covenant relationship with God and is echoed in other prophetic calls for the destruction of idols (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, often referred to as Jacob in prophetic literature, symbolizing the collective people of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_stones.htm">Altar Stones</a></b><br>Used in idol worship, these stones are to be destroyed as a sign of repentance and turning away from idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, which were prevalent in Israel's idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/incense_altars.htm">Incense Altars</a></b><br>Structures used for burning incense in worship, often associated with pagan rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process of making amends or reparation for sin, leading to reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_removal_of_idolatry.htm">Repentance and Removal of Idolatry</a></b><br>True repentance involves not only a change of heart but also the active removal of anything that stands between us and God.

The verse previews Israel&#8217;s future repentance under Messiah, illustrates the depth of true contrition, and invites believers today to respond with the same zeal, smashing every rival to Christ so that only His altar remains.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</span>--The pronoun may refer either to the chastisement of the previous verse as the instrument of purification (preferably), or to the destruction of idols which follows as the result and proof of that purification, the end contemplated by Jehovah in His chastisements.<p><span class= "bld">This is all the fruit to take away his sin.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">of taking away his sin. </span>The words repeat the thought of the previous clause. The fruit of repentance and forgiveness will be found in rooting out all vestiges of idol-worship. The LXX., "when I shall take away their sins," is quoted by St. Paul in <a href="/romans/11-27.htm" title="For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.">Romans 11:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The groves and images.</span>--Literally, as elsewhere, the <span class= "ital">Asherahs, </span>or <span class= "ital">the sun-images, </span>the two leading features of the <span class= "ital">cultus </span>which Israel had borrowed from the Ph?nicians. In the action of Josiah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/34-3.htm" title="For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.">2Chronicles 34:3-4</a>) we may, with little doubt, trace a conscious endeavour to fulfil the condition which Isaiah had thus proclaimed. He sought to "purge" Judah and Jerusalem from the <span class= "ital">"</span>groves and the carved (sun) images, and molten images."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By this</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by the punishment inflicted." God accepts punishment as an expiation of sin; and this punishment of Judah was especially intended to be expiatory, and to remove at once his guilt, and the evil temper which had led him into sin. Its fruit would be a revulsion from idolatry, which would show itself in a fierce determination to destroy all idolatrous emblems and implements, <span class="cmt_word">altars, groves,</span> <span class="cmt_word">images</span>, and the like. This spirit was strongly shown in the Maccabee period (see 1 Macc. 5:44, 68 1 Macc. 10:84 1 Macc. 13:47, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones</span>.
