In the context of Isaiah, it speaks to the impending judgment on Israel and Judah due to their disobedience and idolatry. The "day of reckoning" is a time when God holds nations and individuals accountable for their actions. This concept is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, where the day of the Lord is described as a time of darkness and distress.<p><b>when devastation comes from afar?</b><br>The devastation mentioned here is likely referring to the Assyrian invasion, which was a significant threat to Israel and Judah during Isaiah's time. Historically, the Assyrians were known for their military prowess and brutal conquests, which brought destruction to many nations. The phrase "from afar" emphasizes the foreign nature of the threat, highlighting the reach and power of the Assyrian empire. This serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty in using foreign nations as instruments of judgment, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.<p><b>To whom will you flee for help?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of relying on human alliances or false gods for deliverance. In Isaiah's time, Israel and Judah often sought help from neighboring nations like Egypt, rather than turning to God. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where reliance on anything other than God is shown to be inadequate (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). The question challenges the reader to consider their own sources of security and to recognize that true help comes only from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>).<p><b>Where will you leave your wealth?</b><br>This phrase highlights the temporary and insecure nature of material possessions in the face of divine judgment. In times of crisis, wealth cannot provide safety or salvation. This is a common biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, which states that riches do not profit in the day of wrath. The question serves as a warning against placing trust in material wealth, urging a focus on spiritual riches and a relationship with God, as emphasized in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to the people of Judah and Israel, warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience and injustice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, who were often warned by prophets like Isaiah about their unfaithfulness and the consequences thereof.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The foreign nation used by God as an instrument of judgment against Israel and Judah, representing the "devastation from afar."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_reckoning.htm">Day of Reckoning</a></b><br>A time of divine judgment and accountability for the people's actions, emphasizing the seriousness of God's justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth.htm">Wealth</a></b><br>Symbolizes the misplaced trust and false security of the people, who relied on material possessions rather than God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Inevitability of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's justice is certain, and a day of reckoning will come for all.

This verse applies that larger prophetic announcement specifically to Judah&#8217;s leaders who had oppressed the poor (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The question &#8220;What will you do?&#8221; exposes the futility of every human scheme when confronted with God&#8217;s tribunal (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). There will be no excuses, no negotiations, no appeals&#8212;only accountability before the righteous Judge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When devastation comes from afar</b><p>Isaiah continues, &#8220;when devastation comes from afar&#8221; (10:3b). God had already revealed the instrument of that devastation: Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes earlier covenant warnings: &#8220;The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>).<p>&#8226; History confirms the literal fulfillment: Assyria swept into the northern kingdom in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) and threatened Judah in 701 BC (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36&#8211;37</a>).<p>&#8226; The point is both historical and theological. When God&#8217;s patience expires, judgment arrives swiftly and from unexpected quarters (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). Human distance offers no buffer against divine reach (<a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom will you flee for help</b><p>&#8220;To whom will you flee for help?&#8221; (10:3c).

Yet God declares such partnerships powerless (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; True refuge is found only in the Lord, &#8220;our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament completes the picture: salvation is in Christ alone (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). On judgment day, any hope outside Him collapses (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where will you leave your wealth</b><p>&#8220;Where will you leave your wealth?&#8221; (10:3d). Oppressive leaders had amassed riches by exploiting the weak (<a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>), but judgment exposes the folly of trusting in material security.<p>&#8226; Wealth cannot ransom a soul (<a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6-9</a>) and offers no advantage in the courtroom of God (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus told of the rich fool whose abundance could not extend his life by a single night (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s verdict remains true: &#8220;Naked I came&#8230; and naked I will depart&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).

Had those corrupt judges asked themselves what they would do when the Supreme Judge should call them to account? Had they an ally who could protect them against Jehovah? Or had they found a hiding-place for the treasures which they had made their "glory"? Had they made a covenant with Hades and with death? (<a href="/isaiah/28-18.htm" title="And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.">Isaiah 28:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the day of visitation</span>? "The day of visitation" is the day when God reckons with his servants, and demands an account from each of the work done in his vineyard, being prepared to recompense the good and punish the bad (comp. <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>). It is oftenest used in a bad sense because, unhappily, so many more are found to deserve punishment than reward<span class="cmt_word">. The desolation which shall come from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the crashing ruin</span> (Cheyne). It is sudden, and complete destruction, rather than mere desolateness, that is threatened. Previous prophecies, especially <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>, had informed the Jews that it was to "come from far," "by them that were beyond the river." <span class="cmt_word">To whom will ye flee</span>? The prophet speaks in bitter irony. Is there any one to whom ye can flee? any one who can protect you from the wrath of God? Ye well know there is no one. <span class="cmt_word">Where will ye leave your glory</span>? With whom will ye deposit your riches, your magnificence, your jewels, your grand apparel? You cannot save them. They will all make to themselves wings, and "fly away like a bird" (<a href="/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
