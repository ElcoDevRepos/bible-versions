The events of <a href="/isaiah/39.htm">Isaiah 39</a> occur after Hezekiah's illness and miraculous recovery, which are detailed in the preceding chapter. This period is during the late 8th century BC, a time of significant political upheaval in the Near East.<p><b>Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon</b><br>Merodach-baladan was a historical figure known for his opposition to Assyrian dominance. He ruled Babylon intermittently and is noted for his attempts to assert Babylonian independence. His name, which includes the Babylonian god Marduk, reflects the religious and cultural milieu of Babylon. His interactions with Hezekiah highlight the geopolitical tensions of the era, as Babylon sought allies against Assyria.<p><b>sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah</b><br>The sending of letters and gifts was a common diplomatic practice in the ancient Near East, often used to establish alliances or express goodwill. This act by Merodach-baladan can be seen as an attempt to court Hezekiah's favor and possibly secure an alliance against their common enemy, Assyria. The gifts may have been intended to flatter Hezekiah and gain his trust.<p><b>for he had heard about Hezekiah&#8217;s illness and recovery</b><br>Hezekiah's illness and subsequent recovery were significant events, not only for Judah but also for surrounding nations. The miraculous nature of his recovery, as described in <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, would have been seen as a sign of divine favor. This would have made Hezekiah an attractive ally for Merodach-baladan, who was seeking to strengthen his position against Assyria.

God had just added fifteen years to Hezekiah&#8217;s life and turned back the shadow on the stairway; Judah&#8217;s king was basking in the afterglow of a supernatural intervention. The timing is crucial: victories and blessings often open the door to new tests (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon</b><p>&#8226; Scripture presents Merodach-baladan (also spelled &#8220;Berodach-baladan&#8221; in <a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>) as the ruling figure in Babylon who repeatedly fought Assyrian dominance.<p>&#8226; His appearance here signals Babylon&#8217;s growing importance; Isaiah will shortly prophesy that this same empire will carry Judah into exile (<a href="/isaiah/39-5.htm">Isaiah 39:5-7, 13</a>:1-19).<p>&#8226; The detail &#8220;son of Baladan&#8221; grounds the narrative in real history and underscores Scripture&#8217;s reliability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah</b><p>&#8226; Letters implied an invitation to join an anti-Assyrian coalition; the gift was diplomatic flattery.

In the wake of miraculous blessing, Babylon&#8217;s king sent emissaries to court Hezekiah&#8217;s favor. The moment reveals three truths: God&#8217;s past mercies do not free us from present vigilance; worldly alliances flatter only to ensnare; and pride after blessing invites discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXXIX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Merodach-baladan.</span>--The name is conspicuous in the Assyrian inscriptions of Sargon (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, ix.</span> 13), as having rebelled against him and set up an independent monarchy. He is described in them as <span class= "ital">son of Yakin, </span>but this is, probably, a dynastic appellative, just as Jehu is described in the Assyrian records (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 41) as "the son of Khumri" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Omri). The mission had two ostensible objects: (1) congratulation on Hezekiah's recovery; (2) to inquire and report as to the phenomenon of the sun-dial (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2Chronicles 32:31</a>). Really, we may believe the object of Merodach-baladan was to open negotiations for an alliance with Judah. The "present," interpreted after the manner of the East, would seem almost like an acknowledgment of Hezekiah's <span class= "ital">hegemony, </span>or even <span class= "ital">suzerainty, </span>in such a confederacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>, where it appears that a part of the business of the ambassadors was to inquire concerning the astronomical marvel which had recently occurred in the land). The embassy probably followed the illness of Hezekiah within a year. <span class="cmt_word">Merodach-Baladan</span>. This is a more correct form than the "Berodach-Baladan" of <a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>. The name is one common to several Babylonian kings, as to one who reigned about <span class="date">B.C. 1325</span>, to a second who is placed about <span class="date">B.C. 900</span>, and to a third who was contemporary with the Assyrian kings Sargon and Sennacherib. It is this last of whom we have a notice in the present passage. He appears first in the Assyrian inscriptions as a petty prince, ruling a small tract upon the seacoast, about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. Tiglath-Pileser takes tribute front him about <span class="date">B.C. 744</span>. In <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> we find him advanced to a more prominent position. Taking advantage of the troubles of the time, he shakes off the Assyrians yoke, and makes himself King of Babylon, where he has a reign of twelve years - from <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. This reign is recognized by Sargon in his inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and by the Greek chronologist, Ptolemy, in his 'Canon.' In <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> Sargon leads an expedition against him, and drives him out of Babylonia into the coast-tract, Chaldea, where he besieges him in his ancestral town Bit-Yakin, takes the city, and makes him prisoner (ibid., p. 15). On the death of Sargon, in <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, Merodach-Baladan escapes from confinement, and hastens once more to Babylon, where he is acknowledged as king, and has a second reign, which lasts six months (Alex. Polyhist. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1. 5. &sect; 1). He is then driven from the country by Sennacherib, and, after various vicissitudes, obliged to become a refugee in Elam (G. Smith, 'Hist. of Babylonia,' pp. 125-128). The name of Merodach-Baladau is composed of the three elements, <span class="accented">Merodach</span> (equivalent to "Mar-duk"), the god, <span class="accented">bal</span> or <span class="accented">pal</span>, "son," and <span class="accented">iddina</span>, "has given," and thus signifies "Merodach has given (me) a son." <span class="cmt_word">The son of Baladan</span>. "Baladan" is scarcely a possible Babylonian name. "Beladan" would, however, be quite possible, being a name formed on the model of Ishtardddin ('Eponym Canon,' p. 30), Ninip-iddin (p. 35), Ilu-iddin (p. 57), etc. And the corruption of Beladan into Baladan would be easy. Merodach-Baladan III. is called by Sargon "the son of Yakin;" but this is perhaps a tribal or local rather than a personal name. Compare Jehu's appellation of "son of Omri" (ibid., p. 114). <span class="cmt_word">Sent letters and a present to Hezekiah</span>. Hezekiah's fourteenth year was <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>. Merodach-Baladan had then been King of Babylon for eight years, and, knowing that he might at any time be attacked by Sargon, was naturally looking out for alliances with other powers, which Assyria equally threatened. He had recently concluded a treaty with Khumbanigas, King of Elam ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and had obtained the support of several of the Aramaean tribes on the Euphrates. He now apparently thought that Judaea, which Sargon was also threatening (ch. 38:6), might be induced to join him. Hezekiah's illness and "the wonder done in the land" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>) furnished him with pretexts for an embassy, which probably had more serious objects than either congratulation or scientific inquiry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/39-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1441;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;hi&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
