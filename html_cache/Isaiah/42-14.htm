Historically, God often allowed nations to follow their own paths, giving them time to repent. This silence can be seen in the intertestamental period, where prophetic voices were rare. Theologically, it reflects God's long-suffering nature, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish.<p><b>I have remained quiet and restrained.</b><br>God's restraint suggests His control over judgment and mercy. In the context of Israel, God often withheld immediate judgment to allow for repentance. This restraint is evident in the history of Israel's repeated cycles of sin and redemption. It also points to God's sovereignty, as He chooses the timing and manner of His interventions.<p><b>But now I will groan like a woman in labor;</b><br>The imagery of a woman in labor signifies an intense, unavoidable, and transformative event. This metaphor is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6-7</a>, to describe the coming of God's judgment and the birth of a new era. It suggests that God's intervention will be both painful and productive, leading to a new creation or order.<p><b>I will at once gasp and pant.</b><br>This phrase conveys urgency and intensity. It indicates that God's action will be swift and powerful, leaving no room for delay. The imagery of gasping and panting suggests a release of pent-up energy, similar to the suddenness of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who fulfills God's promises with decisive action, as seen in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His long-held silence and the impending action He is about to take.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, addressing the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, often in need of correction and encouragement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman_in_labor.htm">Woman in Labor</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe the intensity and inevitability of God's forthcoming actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_timing.htm">God's Patience and Timing</a></b><br>God's silence is not indicative of inaction or indifference.

But now I rebuke you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For generations He allowed nations to go their own way, as <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a> reminds us: &#8220;Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times, He now commands all people everywhere to repent.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His restraint flows from steadfast love, not weakness. Second Peter 3:9 underscores this: &#8220;The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise&#8230; but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have remained quiet and restrained</b><p>&#8226; Isaiah pictures the Lord holding back righteous anger, much like a parent giving repeated warnings.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a> assures us, &#8220;Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you&#8230; the LORD is a just God,&#8221; pairing His justice with grace.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-26</a> urges waiting quietly for His salvation. Even Rome-2:4 reminds us not to &#8220;disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience,&#8221; for continued sin invites eventual judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But now I will groan like a woman in labor</b><p>&#8226; The image shifts from stillness to the unavoidable anguish of childbirth. Pain signals imminent delivery; so God&#8217;s groan announces decisive action.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a> echoes the sound: &#8220;I hear a cry like a woman in labor&#8230; her hands stretched out.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus used the same picture in <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>&#8212;pain precedes joy.

Like a woman&#8217;s labor pains that signal a new birth, His groan, gasp, and pant announce decisive intervention&#8212;both judgment against persistent rebellion and salvation for those who trust Him.

(Comp. <a href="/matthew/24-8.htm" title="All these are the beginning of sorrows.">Matthew 24:8</a>.)

He has chafed, as it were, under the necessity of inaction, and has with difficulty refrained himself. Now he will refrain no longer. <span class="cmt_word">A travailing woman</span>. A woman in her travail, after long endurance, at last gives free vent to her natural feelings, and utters loud cries (compare the preceding verse). I will destroy and devour at once (so Gesenius, Kay, and the ancient versions).
