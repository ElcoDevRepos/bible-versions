It reflects the prophetic nature of Isaiah's writings, where God communicates His will and judgment through the prophet. This is a common formula in prophetic literature, underscoring the seriousness and authenticity of the message.<p><b>These people draw near to Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips:</b><br>This highlights the superficiality of the people's worship. They perform religious rituals and speak words of devotion, but it is not genuine. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where God desires sincere worship from the heart rather than mere external compliance (see <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> and <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). Jesus later quotes this passage in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a> and <a href="/mark/7-6.htm">Mark 7:6-7</a>, applying it to the Pharisees, showing its enduring relevance.<p><b>But their hearts are far from Me:</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This phrase indicates a disconnect between outward actions and inner reality. The people of Israel were engaging in religious practices without true devotion or love for God. This is a recurring issue in Israel's history, where external religiosity often masked internal rebellion (see <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>).<p><b>Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men:</b><br>This critique points to the human traditions and commandments that had supplanted genuine worship. It suggests that the people were more focused on following human traditions than on understanding and obeying God's commandments. This is a warning against legalism and the danger of elevating human traditions above divine revelation. Jesus' use of this passage in the Gospels criticizes the Pharisees for similar practices, emphasizing the need for worship that is rooted in truth and spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Side by side with the great commandments of the Law and with the incisive teaching of the prophets there was growing up even then a traditional system of ethics and religion, based upon wrong principles, ending in a dishonest casuistry and a formal devotion. Commentaries even then were darkening counsel by words without knowledge, as they did in the Mishna and the Gemara of the later days of Judaism (<a href="/matthew/15-3.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?">Matthew 15:3</a>; <a href="/mark/7-6.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.">Mark 7:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the Lord said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">moreover the Lord said</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>This people draw near me with their mouth.</span> Samaria had been punished for open idolatry and flagrant neglect of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-17</a>). Jerusalem had not gone these lengths. She still, in profession, clung to the worship of Jehovah, and had even recently accepted a purification of religion at the hand of Hezekiah, who had "removed the high places," and cut down the groves, and broken in pieces the brazen serpent," because the people burnt incense to it (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). But her religion was a <span class="accented">mere</span> lip-service, which God detested - it was outward, formal, hypocritical (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). Jerusalem, therefore, no less than Samaria, deserved and would receive a severe chastisement. But have removed their heart far from me. Here lies the gist of the charge. It was not that there was too much outward religion, but that there was no inward religion corresponding to it. Lip-service without inward religion is a mockery, though it is not always felt as such. <span class="cmt_word">Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men</span>. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that ritual books had been already published by the authority of the priests, and that these were followed, on account of the human authority which had issued them, without any reference to the Law. Thus ritual obedience became mere obedience to "the precept of men." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/29-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1434;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
