In biblical context, receiving a portion with the great implies honor and recognition. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the promise that those who humble themselves will be exalted (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The Servant's victory is not just spiritual but also involves a recognition of His authority and triumph over sin and death.<p><b>and He will divide the spoils with the strong</b><br>This imagery of dividing spoils is reminiscent of a victorious king sharing the plunder after a battle. It suggests that the Servant, having triumphed over sin and death, shares the benefits of His victory with His followers. This can be connected to <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ is described as having disarmed the powers and authorities, making a public spectacle of them.<p><b>because He has poured out His life unto death</b><br>The phrase indicates the voluntary and sacrificial nature of the Servant's death. "Poured out" suggests a complete and willing offering, akin to a drink offering in the Old Testament (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). This act of self-sacrifice is central to the Christian understanding of atonement, where Jesus' death is seen as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>and He was numbered with the transgressors</b><br>This phrase highlights the identification of the Servant with sinners. It is directly fulfilled in the New Testament when Jesus is crucified between two criminals (<a href="/mark/15-27.htm">Mark 15:27-28</a>). This identification with sinners is crucial for the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, where Jesus takes on the sins of humanity (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>Yet He bore the sin of many</b><br>The Servant's role as a sin-bearer is central to the prophecy. This phrase underscores the vicarious nature of His suffering, where He takes upon Himself the sins of others. This is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, which states that Jesus bore our sins in His body on the cross. The "many" indicates the vast scope of His redemptive work, encompassing all who believe.<p><b>and made intercession for the transgressors</b><br>The Servant's work does not end with His death; He continues to intercede for sinners. This intercession is seen in Jesus' prayer on the cross, "Father, forgive them" (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>), and is a continuing ministry as described in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, where He is said to always live to intercede for those who come to God through Him. This highlights the ongoing nature of Christ's priestly role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This is a prophetic reference to Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the suffering servant described in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. He is the one who bears the sins of many and makes intercession for transgressors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgressors.htm">Transgressors</a></b><br>These are the sinners for whom the Servant intercedes. In the New Testament context, this includes all of humanity, as all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_and_the_strong.htm">The Great and the Strong</a></b><br>These terms symbolize those who are victorious or honored. The Servant is promised a portion with them, indicating His ultimate victory and exaltation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/intercession.htm">Intercession</a></b><br>This refers to the act of intervening on behalf of another. In this context, it highlights Jesus' role as an intercessor for sinners, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spoils.htm">Spoils</a></b><br>This term is often associated with the rewards of victory in battle. Here, it symbolizes the triumph and reward of the Servant after His sacrificial death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_ultimate_sacrifice.htm">The Ultimate Sacrifice</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to pour out His life unto death is the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. Believers are called to reflect on this profound love and respond with gratitude and devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_through_suffering.htm">Victory Through Suffering</a></b><br>The promise of a portion with the great and the division of spoils signifies that true victory often comes through suffering and obedience to God's will. Christians are encouraged to persevere through trials, knowing that God honors faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_for_others.htm">Intercession for Others</a></b><br>Just as Jesus intercedes for us, we are called to intercede for others in prayer, lifting up those who are lost or struggling in their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identifying_with_the_transgressors.htm">Identifying with the Transgressors</a></b><br>Jesus' identification with sinners challenges us to reach out to those who are marginalized or deemed unworthy by society, sharing the message of redemption and hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_light_of_redemption.htm">Living in the Light of Redemption</a></b><br>Understanding that Jesus bore our sins should lead to a life of holiness and a commitment to living out the gospel in our daily interactions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_53_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 53:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_12_Jesus_as_sinners_intercessor.htm">How does Isaiah 53:12 highlight Jesus' role as an intercessor for sinners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_numbered_show_Jesus_humility.htm">What does "numbered with the transgressors" reveal about Jesus' humility and sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_emulate_Jesus_sacrifice.htm">How can we emulate Jesus' willingness to "bear the sin of many"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_53_12_to_Jesus_atonement.htm">Connect Isaiah 53:12 with New Testament teachings on Jesus' atoning work.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_53_12_show_Christ_s_love.htm">How does understanding Isaiah 53:12 deepen our appreciation for Christ's sacrificial love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_12_s_link_to_Jesus_role.htm">How does Isaiah 53:12 foreshadow the role of Jesus in Christian theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Isaiah_53_12_in_atonement.htm">Why is Isaiah 53:12 significant in understanding the concept of atonement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_12_fulfilled_in_NT_evidence.htm">What historical evidence supports the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:12 in the New Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_53.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/has_he_risen.htm">Has He risen?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_were_christ's_last_words.htm">What were Christ's final words on the cross?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/has_the_bible_been_corrupted.htm">Has the Bible been corrupted?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'cross_is_foolishness'_mean.htm">What is the Lord's oracle?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 53:12 Mean</div><b>Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great</b><p>&#8220;Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; links every promise here to the Servant&#8217;s obedience described in the earlier verses.
