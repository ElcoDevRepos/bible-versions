In the context of Isaiah, the "law" refers to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Jewish life and worship. The "testimony" likely refers to the prophetic messages that God delivered through His prophets. This call to the law and testimony underscores the authority of Scripture as the ultimate standard for truth and guidance. It reflects the Jewish understanding of the Torah as the foundation of their covenant relationship with God. This phrase also anticipates the New Testament emphasis on the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>If they do not speak according to this word,</b><br>This part of the verse warns against false teachings and prophecies that do not align with God's revealed word. In Isaiah's time, there were many false prophets and diviners who led people astray with messages that contradicted God's commands. The phrase serves as a litmus test for discerning truth from error. It highlights the necessity of measuring all teachings against the established word of God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to test the spirits and hold fast to what is good (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p><b>they have no light of dawn.</b><br>The imagery of "light" and "dawn" symbolizes understanding, truth, and divine revelation. Those who reject or distort God's word are described as being in darkness, lacking the illumination that comes from God's truth. In biblical symbolism, light often represents God's presence and guidance (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>). The absence of light signifies spiritual blindness and separation from God. This phrase foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), who brings true understanding and salvation to those who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Isaiah is reminding Judah that God has spoken clearly.<p>&#8226; Moses urged, &#8220;Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua was told, &#8220;This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>).<p>The prophet&#8217;s call presses us to run every teaching, dream, or cultural claim through the sieve of what God has already written. God&#8217;s law is not a moving target; it is the fixed standard by which all things are judged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to the testimony!</b><p>&#8220;Testimony&#8221; embraces the prophetic witness that accompanies the law. Isaiah ties his own words&#8212;and those of faithful prophets&#8212;to the covenant record.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a> the angel says, &#8220;The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy,&#8221; showing that true prophetic speech always lines up with God&#8217;s revealed character and redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Isaiah himself records earlier, &#8220;Bind up the testimony; seal the law among my disciples&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>), linking both strands.<p>The written law and the prophetic testimony together form a complete, harmonious revelation. Separate them, and you invite distortion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they do not speak according to this word</b><p>Here Isaiah sets an objective test. Speakers, teachers, visionaries&#8212;whoever they are&#8212;must be measured by &#8220;this word,&#8221; not by charisma, popularity, or apparent success.<p>&#8226; Paul uses the same yard-stick: &#8220;Even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The Bereans were praised because they &#8220;examined the Scriptures daily to see if these teachings were true&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>God never leaves His people to guess whether a message is from Him. Agreement with Scripture is the non-negotiable proof.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they have no light of dawn</b><p>Failing the test leaves a person in darkness, however impressive he may look.<p>&#8226; Jesus warned that &#8220;if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-23.htm">Matthew 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; John notes, &#8220;Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9</a>), showing that darkness reveals itself in both doctrine and practice.<p>To lack the &#8220;light of dawn&#8221; is to miss the rising Sun of righteousness (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>), to wander without guidance, hope, or life. The picture is stark: cling to Scripture&#8217;s authority or remain in spiritual night.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/8-20.htm">Isaiah 8:20</a> places the spotlight on God&#8217;s unchanging revelation.
