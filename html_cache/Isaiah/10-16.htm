This title underscores God's power and ability to execute judgment. In the context of Isaiah, it highlights God's control over nations, including Assyria, which He uses as an instrument of judgment against Israel but also holds accountable for its pride and cruelty.<p><b>will send a wasting disease among Assyria&#8217;s stout warriors</b><br>The "wasting disease" symbolizes a debilitating affliction that God will send upon the Assyrian army, rendering their strength ineffective. Historically, Assyria was known for its military might and conquests, but this prophecy foretells their downfall through divine intervention. This reflects the biblical theme that human power is ultimately subject to God's will. The "stout warriors" represent the pride and confidence of Assyria, which will be humbled by God's judgment.<p><b>and under his pomp will be kindled a fire like a burning flame</b><br>The "pomp" refers to the arrogance and splendor of Assyria, which will be consumed by God's judgment, depicted as a "burning flame." This imagery of fire is often used in the Bible to represent purification and destruction. It signifies the complete and consuming nature of God's judgment. The fire metaphor connects to other scriptures where God's judgment is likened to fire, such as in <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that comes through Christ, who is both a refiner's fire and a purifier.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god_of_hosts.htm">The Lord GOD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and command over the heavenly armies.

A continuation of ver. 12, showing what the nature of Assyria's punishment shall be. The prophet expresses it by two images - first, that of a wasting sickness; and secondly, that of a fire. The first image expresses that gradual decay of national spirit which saps the vital strength of a nation; the second is more suited to denote some external attack under which the weakened nation should succumb. There are traces, in the later history of Assyria, both of increasing internal weakness through luxury and effeminacy, and of violent external attacks culminating in the combined Median and Babylonian invasion, before which her power collapsed (Abyden. ap.
