The use of "Behold" serves as a call to attention, emphasizing the seriousness of the message. The LORD, Yahweh, is depicted as the sovereign judge over all the earth, not just Israel. This reflects the universal scope of God's authority and judgment, reminiscent of the flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, where God judged the entire world. The term "lays waste" suggests a complete and utter destruction, aligning with prophetic themes found in other books such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where God's judgment is portrayed as thorough and inescapable.<p><b>and leaves it in ruins.</b><br>The imagery of ruins indicates the aftermath of divine judgment, where the earth is left desolate. This can be seen as a reversal of creation, where order is turned into chaos. The prophetic literature often uses such imagery to convey the severity of God's judgment, as seen in the destruction of cities like Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). Theologically, this serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>He will twist its surface</b><br>The twisting of the earth's surface suggests a dramatic alteration of the natural order, possibly indicating earthquakes or other natural disasters as instruments of divine judgment. This imagery is consistent with apocalyptic literature, where cosmic disturbances often accompany the end times (e.g., <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12-14</a>). It underscores the power of God to reshape creation according to His will, reflecting His ultimate control over the physical world.<p><b>and scatter its inhabitants&#8212;</b><br>The scattering of inhabitants implies a forced dispersion, reminiscent of the Tower of Babel incident in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, where God confused the languages and scattered the people. This act serves as a judgment against human pride and self-sufficiency. In the context of Isaiah, it may also allude to the exile of Israel and Judah, where the people were scattered among the nations as a result of their disobedience. This scattering is both a physical and spiritual consequence, highlighting the disruption of community and covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is depicted as the one executing judgment upon the earth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Represents the physical world and its inhabitants, which are subject to God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_earth.htm">Inhabitants of the Earth</a></b><br>The people living on the earth who are affected by God's actions of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message of impending judgment, serving as God's mouthpiece.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_event.htm">Judgment Event</a></b><br>A prophetic declaration of a future time when God will bring desolation and upheaval to the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>Recognize that God is sovereign over all creation and has the authority to judge the earth and its inhabitants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Understand that divine judgment is a reality that affects all of creation, calling for a response of repentance and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live holy and godly lives in anticipation of God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>While judgment is certain, God&#8217;s ultimate plan includes restoration and renewal for those who are faithful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>The impending judgment should motivate us to share the gospel, urging others to seek salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_24_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 24:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_God_s_control_over_earth.htm">How does Isaiah 24:1 illustrate God's sovereignty over the earth's condition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_God_s_power_to_destroy_earth.htm">What actions in Isaiah 24:1 demonstrate God's power to "lay waste the earth"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_Inspire_righteousness.htm">How can Isaiah 24:1 inspire us to live righteously amid worldly chaos?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_show_God_s_creation_power.htm">What other scriptures emphasize God's authority over creation similar to Isaiah 24:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_God_s_judgment_mercy_today.htm">How should Isaiah 24:1 influence our understanding of God's judgment and mercy today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_on_God_s_earth_control.htm">What does Isaiah 24:1 reveal about God's sovereignty over the earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_24_1_and_divine_judgment.htm">How does Isaiah 24:1 align with the concept of divine judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Which_events_does_Isaiah_24_1_reference.htm">What historical events might Isaiah 24:1 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_isaiah_24's_global_ruin.htm">Where is the archaeological or historical evidence for the kind of worldwide ruin and upheaval described in Isaiah 24?

Of these Assyria was then the most prominent within the horizon of the prophet's view; but Moab appears in <a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a>, and the language, with that exception, seems deliberately generalised, as if to paint the general discomfiture in every age (and, above all, in the great age of the future Deliverer) of the enemies of Jehovah and His people. The Hebrew word for "earth" admits (as elsewhere) of the rendering "land"; but here the wider meaning seems to predominate, as in its union with the "world," in <a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm" title="The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.">Isaiah 24:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-20.</span> - GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON THE WORLD AT LARGE. From special denunciations of woe upon particular nations - Baby-loll, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria of Damascus, Egypt and Ethiopia, Arabia, Judea, Tyre - the prophet passes to denunciations of a broader character, involving the future of the whole world. This section of his work extends from the commencement of <a href="/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>. to the conclusion of <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, thus including four chapters. The world at large is the general subject of the entire prophecy; but the "peculiar people" still maintains a marked and prominent place, as spiritually the leading country, and as one in whose fortunes the world at large would be always vitally concerned (see especially <a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6, 9, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty</span>.

The mention of "the world" in ver. 4, and of "the-kings of the earth" in ver. 21, implies a wider field of survey than the Holy Land.
