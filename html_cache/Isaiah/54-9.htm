In <a href="/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11</a>, God made a covenant with Noah, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again. This reference to Noah's time highlights the seriousness and permanence of God's promise. The days of Noah were marked by judgment followed by a covenant of peace, symbolizing a new beginning for humanity. This sets the stage for understanding God's commitment to His people in Isaiah.<p><b>when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth</b><br>The swearing of an oath by God emphasizes the unbreakable nature of His promises. The floodwaters in Noah's time were a form of divine judgment, but God's promise to never again cover the earth with such waters signifies His mercy and faithfulness. This assurance is foundational for understanding God's character as one who keeps His word. The rainbow, as a sign of this covenant, serves as a continual reminder of God's mercy and faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13-17</a>).<p><b>So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you</b><br>This promise reflects God's commitment to His people, akin to the covenant with Noah. The assurance of no longer being angry or rebuking them indicates a shift from judgment to grace. This is a prophetic declaration of the new covenant, where God's relationship with His people is based on grace rather than wrath. It foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Jesus Christ, who bore God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>). This promise is a source of comfort and hope, emphasizing God's enduring love and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's prophecies often focus on themes of judgment and redemption.

Strictly speaking, <a href="/genesis/9-11.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.">Genesis 9:11</a> speaks of a "covenant," not an "oath," but it would be idle to find a difficulty in the use of words which, as referring to a Divine act, are almost or altogether interchangeable. It is obvious that the words have found their fulfilment not in any earthly city but in the heavenly Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/54.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is as the waters of Noah unto me</span>. The existing calamity - Israel submerged in the flood of Babylonian captivity-is as it were a repetition of the calamity of the Deluge in God's eyes. Its object is to purify his Church, as the object of the Flood was to purify the world. A righteous household survived in the one case; a righteous remnant would go forth in the other. And as God bound himself in Noah's time not to repeat the calamity of the Deluge, so now he binds himself not again to submerge his Church in a captivity like the Babylonian. It has been said that the promise was not kept, since the Jewish Church was, in A.D. , carried captive by the Romans. But the prophet views the Jewish Church as continued in the Christian, into which all its better and more spiritual members passed at the first preaching of the gospel; and the promise here made is thus parallel to that of our Lord, "Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). Much as the Christian Church has suffered from the world, it has never been in like cases with the Jewish Church in Babylon, and, as God is faithful, never will be reduced to such extremity. <span class="cmt_word">As I have sworn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pledged myself." It does not appear from <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20-22</a> or Genesis 9:8-17 that God actually bound himself by oath. <span class="cmt_word">So have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee</span>.
