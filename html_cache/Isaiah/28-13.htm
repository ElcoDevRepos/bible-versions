Historically, the Israelites had received clear instructions and prophecies from God through His prophets. However, due to their disobedience and hard-heartedness, the clarity of God's word becomes a source of confusion and judgment. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's word is a double-edged sword, offering both guidance and judgment depending on the heart of the listener (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line;</b><br>This repetition emphasizes the tedious and monotonous nature of the instruction that the people of Israel are receiving. It suggests a mocking tone, as if the people are being treated like children who need simple, repetitive lessons. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where the Israelites were often compared to children in their understanding and obedience (<a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9-10</a>). The phrase also highlights the people's failure to grasp the deeper spiritual truths, as they are stuck on the surface level of God's teachings.<p><b>a little here, a little there,&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse suggests fragmentation and a lack of coherence in the understanding of God's word. It implies that the people are only receiving bits and pieces of the truth, which leads to confusion and misinterpretation. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative where partial understanding often leads to error and misjudgment (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9-12</a>). The phrase also underscores the importance of seeking the full counsel of God rather than relying on isolated teachings.<p><b>so that they will go stumbling backward</b><br>The imagery of stumbling backward indicates a regression rather than progress. In the historical context, this can be seen as a consequence of the Israelites' refusal to heed God's warnings and instructions. Instead of moving forward in their spiritual journey, they are falling back into sin and disobedience. This is a common theme in the Old Testament, where the people's failure to follow God's commands leads to their downfall (<a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>).<p><b>and will be injured, ensnared, and captured.</b><br>This phrase outlines the consequences of the people's spiritual blindness and disobedience. Being injured, ensnared, and captured suggests both physical and spiritual repercussions. Historically, this can be linked to the impending judgment and exile that the Israelites would face due to their unfaithfulness. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the dangers of ignoring God's word, leading to spiritual captivity and separation from God. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, the ultimate Word of God, offers freedom and healing to those who accept Him, contrasting with the captivity that comes from rejecting God's message (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31-36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book and is delivering God's message to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is speaking through Isaiah to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often rebellious and disobedient to God's commands, is the primary audience of this message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, also addressed in Isaiah's prophecies, often warned through the example of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrian_threat.htm">The Assyrian Threat</a></b><br>The historical context includes the looming threat of Assyrian invasion, which serves as a backdrop for the warnings given by Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_spiritual_immaturity.htm">The Danger of Spiritual Immaturity</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were unable to grasp the deeper truths of God's word, we must strive for spiritual maturity to understand and apply God's teachings effectively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Ignoring God's instructions leads to spiritual stumbling and captivity.

God will now speak to them, not by his prophet, but by the Assyrian conqueror, who will do what they said Isaiah had done, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lay upon them command after command, rule alter rule, a constant series of minute injunctions, under which they will chafe and fret and at last rebel, but only to be "snared and taken." It is uncertain whether the reference is to the immediate future and to the Assyrians proper only, or whether the Babylonians are not taken into account also, and their oppression of Judaea pointed to. The yoke of Babylon was probably quite as difficult to endure as that of Assyria; and we find that, in the space of eighteen years, it produced at least three rebellions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/28-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
