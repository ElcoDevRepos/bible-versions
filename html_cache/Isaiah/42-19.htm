Despite being chosen to be a light to the nations, Israel frequently failed to see God's purposes and live according to His commands. This blindness is spiritual, indicating a lack of understanding and obedience. The servant's blindness contrasts with the role they were meant to play, highlighting their failure to fulfill their divine mission.<p><b>or deaf like the messenger I am sending?</b><br>The messenger here is also Israel, tasked with conveying God's message to the world. Deafness symbolizes an inability or unwillingness to hear and respond to God's voice. This reflects Israel's repeated disobedience and idolatry, as seen throughout their history, such as in the wilderness (Exodus 32) and during the time of the judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>).<p><b>Who is blind like My covenant partner</b><br>The term "covenant partner" underscores the special relationship between God and Israel, established through covenants with figures like Abraham (Genesis 15) and Moses (Exodus 19-24). Despite this privileged position, Israel's spiritual blindness is emphasized, showing their failure to uphold their side of the covenant. This blindness is a recurring theme in the prophets, who call Israel to repentance and renewal of their covenantal obligations.<p><b>or blind like the servant of the LORD?</b><br>This phrase reiterates the earlier point, emphasizing the servant's role and failure. The "servant of the LORD" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfills the role of the servant in later passages (Isaiah 53). Unlike Israel, Jesus is the faithful servant who sees and hears God's will perfectly, fulfilling the mission Israel could not. This typology is significant in understanding the messianic prophecies and the ultimate fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Israel has been granted the unmatched privilege of being God&#8217;s &#8220;servant,&#8221; yet no one appears more unaware of His glory than the very nation appointed to display it.<p>&#8226; God had earlier affirmed, &#8220;You are My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, instead of shining, the servant stumbles (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; 29:13&#8211;14).<p>&#8226; Their blindness is not physical but spiritual; they miss the obvious works of the Lord all around them (<a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; This blindness contrasts sharply with the servant of verses 1&#8211;4&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;who perfectly reveals God&#8217;s light (<a href="/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or deaf like the messenger I am sending</b><p>The same people called to hear God&#8217;s voice and relay it to the nations refuse to listen themselves.<p>&#8226; Israel had the Law, the prophets, and countless reminders (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>; 2 Chron 36:15&#8211;16), yet they &#8220;stopped their ears&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s messenger must be receptive before he can be effective; ignoring the message disqualifies the messenger (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;I am sending&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s ongoing plan; He perseveres with His people even when they resist (<a href="/romans/10-21.htm">Romans 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is blind like My covenant partner</b><p>&#8220;Covenant partner&#8221; recalls Sinai, where Israel vowed, &#8220;All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Covenant blindness is especially tragic, because it spurns known obligations (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-2.htm">Deuteronomy 29:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Old Covenant was designed to lead to blessing through obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3&#8211;13</a>), but blindness reversed the blessing (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even so, the covenant remains God&#8217;s framework for eventual restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31&#8211;34</a>; <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or blind like the servant of the LORD?</b><p>The repetition of &#8220;servant&#8221; drives the point home.
