In the context of <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, King Hezekiah is reflecting on his recovery from a terminal illness. The "such things" likely refer to God's interventions and decrees, which are essential for life. Biblically, this aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, where it is stated that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. This highlights the belief that spiritual sustenance is as crucial as physical sustenance.<p><b>and in all of them my spirit finds life</b><br>Hezekiah's spirit finds life in God's promises and actions. This reflects a deep spiritual truth that true life and vitality come from a relationship with God. In <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>, Jesus says, "The words I have spoken to you&#8212;they are full of the Spirit and life." This connection emphasizes that spiritual renewal and life are found in God's word and presence, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>You have restored me to health</b><br>This phrase is a direct acknowledgment of God's healing power. Hezekiah's illness and subsequent recovery are recorded in <a href="/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20:1-11</a>, where God extends his life by fifteen years. This miraculous healing serves as a testament to God's ability to intervene in human affairs and restore health. It also prefigures the healing ministry of Jesus Christ, who healed many as a sign of God's kingdom.<p><b>and have let me live</b><br>The extension of Hezekiah's life is a testament to God's mercy and grace. In the historical context, Hezekiah's recovery was significant not only for him personally but also for the nation of Judah, as his leadership was crucial during a time of Assyrian threat. This phrase underscores the biblical theme that life itself is a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, where it is stated that all the days ordained for us were written in God's book before one of them came to be.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who fell ill and prayed to God for healing.
