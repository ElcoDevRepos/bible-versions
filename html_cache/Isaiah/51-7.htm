In the biblical context, God often calls His people to listen as a prelude to delivering crucial instructions or promises. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where Israel is called to hear and obey the Lord. It underscores the authority of God and the necessity of obedience to His voice.<p><b>you who know what is right</b><br>This refers to those who have an understanding of God's righteousness and His standards. In the context of Isaiah, it is directed towards the faithful remnant of Israel who remain committed to God's covenant. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, personal relationship with God, aligning with the wisdom literature that emphasizes the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>you people with My law in your hearts</b><br>This phrase highlights the internalization of God's law, reminiscent of the new covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people. It signifies a transformation from external adherence to an internalized, heartfelt obedience. This is fulfilled in the New Testament through the work of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>, where the law is written on the hearts of believers.<p><b>Do not fear the scorn of men</b><br>Here, God encourages His people not to be intimidated by human opposition or ridicule. Historically, the faithful in Israel often faced persecution and mockery from both within and outside their community. This exhortation is relevant throughout Scripture, as seen in the New Testament where Jesus tells His disciples not to fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p><b>do not be broken by their insults</b><br>This phrase reassures believers that they should not be disheartened by verbal attacks or derision. The cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient Near East made insults particularly damaging, but God calls His people to find their identity and worth in Him rather than in human approval. This is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to rejoice in persecution for righteousness' sake (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
