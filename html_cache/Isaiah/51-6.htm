In biblical context, the heavens and the earth are often used to represent the entirety of God's creation (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>). This call to observe the heavens and the earth serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all creation. It also reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the cosmos, where the heavens were seen as the realm of the divine and the earth as the domain of humanity.<p><b>for the heavens will vanish like smoke,</b><br>This imagery of the heavens vanishing like smoke suggests the transient nature of the created order. Smoke is ephemeral and quickly dissipates, symbolizing the temporary nature of the physical universe. This aligns with other biblical passages that speak of the heavens being rolled up or changed (<a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-26</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>). It underscores the idea that while creation is temporary, God's promises and purposes are eternal.<p><b>the earth will wear out like a garment,</b><br>The metaphor of the earth wearing out like a garment conveys the idea of aging and decay. In ancient times, garments were valuable but eventually wore out and needed replacement. This reflects the biblical theme of the earth's temporality and the eventual renewal of creation (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>, <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). It emphasizes the contrast between the perishable nature of the world and the imperishable nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>and its people will die like gnats.</b><br>This phrase highlights the frailty and brevity of human life. Gnats are small, insignificant insects with short lifespans, symbolizing the fleeting nature of human existence (<a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). It serves as a humbling reminder of humanity's mortality and the need to rely on God's eternal promises rather than the transient things of this world.<p><b>But My salvation will last forever,</b><br>In contrast to the temporary nature of the heavens, earth, and human life, God's salvation is eternal. This assurance of everlasting salvation is a central theme in the prophetic writings, pointing to God's unchanging faithfulness and covenantal promises (<a href="/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). It foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, whose redemptive work secures eternal life for believers.<p><b>and My righteousness will never fail.</b><br>God's righteousness is depicted as enduring and unfailing, highlighting His moral perfection and justice. This assurance of God's unchanging righteousness provides hope and stability in a world marked by change and decay (<a href="/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>, <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>). It points to the fulfillment of God's righteous purposes through Christ, who embodies divine righteousness and offers it to humanity through faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Look to that which seems to you most stable and most certain to endure - the vast firmament of the heavens, and the solid earth beneath it, of which God "bears up the pillars" (Psalm l25:3). Both these, and man too, are in their nature perishable, and will (or may) vanish away and cease to be. But God, and his power to save, and his eternal law of right, can never pass away, but must endure for evermore. Let Israel be sure that the righteous purposes of God with respect to their own deliverance from Babylon, and to the conversion of the Gentiles, stand firm, and that they will most certainly be accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens shall vanish</span> <span class="cmt_word">away like smoke</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the earth shall wax</span> <span class="cmt_word">old like a garment.</span> So also in <a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>.

They that dwell therein shall die in like manner. Dr. Kay observes that the Hebrew text does not say, "in like manner," but "as in like manner." Man is not subject to the same law of perishableness as the external world, but to a different law. External things simply "pass away" and are no more. Man disappears from the earth, but continues to exist somewhere. He has, by God's gift, a life that is to be unceasing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/51-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Lift up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124;
