It reflects the biblical theme of God's revelation to all nations, not just Israel. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The phrase underscores God's intention for His glory and power to be acknowledged worldwide, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>from where the sun rises to where it sets</b><br>This expression signifies the entirety of the earth, from east to west. It highlights the universality of God's dominion and echoes <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>, which states, "From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised." The phrase suggests that God's authority and presence are not confined to a specific location but encompass the whole world. It also foreshadows the global spread of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus tells His disciples they will be His witnesses "to the ends of the earth."<p><b>that there is none but Me</b><br>This declaration affirms the monotheistic belief central to the faith of Israel. It stands in contrast to the polytheistic cultures surrounding Israel, such as the Babylonians and Egyptians, who worshipped multiple gods. This statement is a direct challenge to idolatry and emphasizes the uniqueness and exclusivity of the God of Israel. It is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Shema, which declares, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."<p><b>I am the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals indicates the divine name YHWH, which is considered sacred and signifies God's eternal, self-existent nature. This name was revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God says, "I AM WHO I AM." It conveys God's unchanging character and His covenant relationship with His people. The declaration "I am the LORD" serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and His role as the ultimate authority and ruler.<p><b>and there is no other</b><br>This phrase reinforces the exclusivity of God, emphasizing that He alone is worthy of worship and allegiance. It serves as a polemic against the false gods of the nations and underscores the futility of idolatry. This assertion is a recurring theme in Isaiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>, where God declares, "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god." It points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and through whom the fullness of God's revelation is made known.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

God uses Cyrus as an instrument to fulfill His purposes, demonstrating His sovereignty over nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is the primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies.

Here we have the third motive of the Divine action respecting Cyrus. The attention of all the world from the extreme east to the extreme west, would be drawn by the wonderful occurrences. Jehovah's hand in them would be perceived, and his sole Godhead would obtain acknowledgment. An impulse was doubtless given to monotheism by the victories of Cyrus and the favour which he showed the Jews; but it cannot be said to have been very marked. Idolatry and polytheism were to a certain extent discredited; but they maintained their ground nevertheless. It was not till the true "Anointed One" appeared - the antitype of whom Cyrus was the type - that the idols were "utterly abolished." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/45-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4616.htm">Strong's 4616: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purpose -- intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all may know,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the rising</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;miz&#183;ra&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
