The phrase indicates divine intervention where God actively orchestrates the rise of adversaries. Rezin was the king of Aram (Syria), and his reign is historically placed in the 8th century BC. The foes mentioned are likely the Assyrians, whom God uses as instruments of judgment against both Aram and Israel. This reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other instances like the Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's control over history and His ability to use even those outside the covenant community to fulfill His plans.<p><b>and joined his enemies together</b><br>This phrase suggests a coalition or alliance of adversaries against Rezin. Historically, this could refer to the Assyrian Empire's expansion under Tiglath-Pileser III, who conquered Damascus and executed Rezin around 732 BC. The uniting of enemies can be seen as a fulfillment of divine prophecy, where God brings together various forces to achieve His judgment. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where God often uses alliances, whether for or against Israel, to bring about His divine will (e.g., the coalition of nations in <a href="/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>). Culturally, alliances were common in the ancient Near East as smaller states often banded together for mutual defense against larger empires. This passage highlights the futility of relying on human alliances instead of trusting in God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is actively involved in the affairs of nations and individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) during the time of Isaiah, who was an adversary of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foes_of_rezin.htm">Foes of Rezin</a></b><br>These are the enemies that God raises up against Rezin, indicating divine intervention in geopolitical affairs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Refers to the collective adversaries that God uses to fulfill His purposes against Rezin and, by extension, against Israel for their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which is under judgment for its rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and uses them to accomplish His purposes, including judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Israel's rebellion leads to divine judgment, reminding us of the importance of obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention_in_world_affairs.htm">Divine Intervention in World Affairs</a></b><br>God actively intervenes in geopolitical events, demonstrating His power and authority over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_enemies_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Enemies in God's Plan</a></b><br>God can use even adversaries to fulfill His divine purposes, showing that nothing is outside His control.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_ultimate_plan.htm">Trust in God's Ultimate Plan</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's plan, even when circumstances seem dire, knowing He works all things for good.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_9_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 9:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_11_God_s_reply_to_Israel_s_pride.htm">How does Isaiah 9:11 illustrate God's response to Israel's pride and arrogance?

The "adversaries" of the text can hardly be any other than the Assyrians; yet the context that follows clearly points to an attack on Ephraim in which the armies of Rezin were to be conspicuous. The natural explanation is that Syria, after the conquest by the Assyrian king (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>), was compelled to take part in a campaign against Samaria. The reading of the text may be retained with this explanation, and the sentence paraphrased thus, "Jehovah will stir up the adversaries of Rezin (the Assyrians who have conquered Syria) against him (Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria), and shall join his enemies against him, and those enemies shall include the very nations on whose support he had counted, the Syrians and the Philistines" (<a href="/context/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7-8</a>). The latter people were, it is true, enemies to Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.">2Chronicles 28:18</a>), but their hostilities extended to the northern kingdom also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him</span>.
