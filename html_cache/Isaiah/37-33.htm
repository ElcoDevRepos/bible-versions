The king of Assyria, likely Sennacherib, represents a powerful empire known for its military conquests and brutality. This statement sets the stage for God's intervention, highlighting His control over historical events and His protection of His people.<p><b>He will not enter this city:</b><br>Jerusalem, the city in question, was the spiritual and political center of Judah. The assurance that the Assyrian king will not enter it underscores God's promise of protection. Historically, Assyrian armies were known for their successful sieges, making this divine promise particularly significant. This phrase also reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant with David, ensuring the preservation of Jerusalem.<p><b>or shoot an arrow into it:</b><br>The imagery of an arrow not being shot into the city signifies complete divine protection. In ancient warfare, archers were often the first line of attack, softening defenses before a full assault. The absence of even a single arrow indicates that the city will remain untouched by the enemy, showcasing God's miraculous intervention.<p><b>He will not come before it with a shield:</b><br>The shield, a defensive tool, suggests preparation for close combat. The assurance that the Assyrian king will not approach with a shield implies that there will be no need for defense, as the threat will be neutralized by God before it reaches the city. This highlights the futility of human efforts against divine will.<p><b>or build up a siege ramp against it:</b><br>Siege ramps were crucial in ancient warfare for breaching city walls. The promise that no siege ramp will be built signifies that the city will not face the typical threats of a siege. This phrase connects to other biblical instances where God intervenes to protect His people, such as the fall of Jericho. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Christ, who overcomes spiritual sieges against His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, assuring His people of His protection and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_assyria.htm">The King of Assyria</a></b><br>Refers to Sennacherib, the Assyrian king who threatened Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army but promised divine protection by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of assurance and deliverance to King Hezekiah and the people of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who sought the Lord's help in the face of the Assyrian threat and received assurance of deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and rulers.

(Comp. <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm" title="And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.">Habakkuk 1:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm" title="And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.">Ezekiel 4:2</a>.) Isaiah's prediction is not only that Jerusalem will not be taken, but that the enemy, though now encamped around it, will not even proceed to the usual operations of a siege.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, etc. A new clause is commenced - the concluding clause of the prophecy. For Hezekiah's satisfaction and consolation something more definite is needed than the vague assurances that "the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at Sennacherib" (ver. 22), and that God would "put a bridle in Sennacherib's mouth" (ver. 29). Accordingly, it is now declared, in the plainest terms, that he shall not even lay siege to the city, but shall return by the way by which he came - the coast route - leaving Jerusalem untouched, nay, unattempted. <span class="cmt_word">He shall not come into this city</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the city.</span> He was at Libnah, in the Shefeleh, thirty or forty miles from Jerusalem, when we last heard of him (ver. 8); and, having then been just informed of the advance of Tirhakah, he is likely to have proceeded on towards Egypt. There is, at any rate, not the slightest intimation of his having made a retrograde movement towards the Jewish capital. <span class="cmt_word">Nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it</span>. The main points of an Assyrian siege are happily seized. The first assailants were the archers. They boldly approached in large bodies, and strove to clear the battlements of the defenders. Then shields were brought into play. Under their cover the archers drew nearer; the scaling parties brought up their ladders; the miners attacked the foundations of the walls; and the torch-bearers endeavoured to fire the gates. Finally, if these tactics did not avail, banks were raised against the walls, which were then assailed with battering-rams till they were breached and the assailants could cuter.
