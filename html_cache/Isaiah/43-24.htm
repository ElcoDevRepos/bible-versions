Sweet cane, or calamus, was a valuable and fragrant spice used in sacred anointing oil (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>). Its mention here signifies the absence of heartfelt offerings. The Israelites were neglecting the true spirit of worship, focusing instead on ritual without sincerity. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires obedience and love over mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p><b>nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices</b><br>The fat of sacrifices was considered the best part and was to be offered to God (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). This phrase indicates that the Israelites' offerings were insufficient and insincere. The sacrificial system was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. However, without genuine repentance and faith, these sacrifices were meaningless (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>, <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>). This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and offered Himself as the perfect atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<p><b>But you have burdened Me with your sins</b><br>Here, God expresses the weight of Israel's sins, which have become a burden to Him. This imagery conveys the seriousness of sin and its impact on the relationship between God and His people. Sin is often depicted as a burden in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>), and this phrase underscores the need for repentance and divine forgiveness. The burden of sin is ultimately lifted through Christ, who invites believers to find rest in Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>you have wearied Me with your iniquities</b><br>The repetition of the idea of weariness emphasizes God's patience and long-suffering nature. Iniquities refer to moral corruption and injustice, which were prevalent among the Israelites. This weariness is not due to God's limitations but highlights His righteous indignation towards persistent disobedience. The prophetic literature often calls for repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, <a href="/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>). This weariness is resolved in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Christ, who reconciles humanity to God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His disappointment with the Israelites' lack of genuine worship and their burdening Him with sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience being addressed, who have failed to honor God with true devotion and have instead burdened Him with their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sweet_cane.htm">Sweet Cane</a></b><br>A valuable spice used in offerings, symbolizing the Israelites' neglect in offering their best to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The ritual offerings that were meant to honor God, which the Israelites have failed to perform sincerely.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sins_and_iniquities.htm">Sins and Iniquities</a></b><br>The moral failures and transgressions of the Israelites that have wearied God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship_over_rituals.htm">True Worship Over Rituals</a></b><br>God desires genuine worship and devotion rather than mere ritualistic offerings.

God reminds His people that they had not been willing to part with their silver to secure this costly aroma for Him.<p>&#8226; The point is not that He needed perfume, but that genuine worship values Him above possessions (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; He is exposing a heart that calculates expense rather than love (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p>&#8226; True devotion gladly brings the best, knowing that &#8220;where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices</b><p>The fat was the richest portion, reserved exclusively for the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). By saying He is unsatisfied, God reveals that even when sacrifices were offered, they lacked sincerity.<p>&#8226; He desires obedience over ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; He values brokenness and contrition above outward ceremony (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; He is never impressed by quantity alone (<a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12-14</a>).

"Sweet cane" is mentioned in the Law only in connection with the "holy anointing oil" (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>). But the present passage raises a suspicion that it was practically used in the burnt offerings of private persons (see the next clause). That it was anciently used in Babylonia in sacrifice, appears from the Deluge Tablets ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3. p. 559, 1. 48). <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast made me to serve with thy sins</span>. "The sins of Israel," as Delitzsch observes, "pressed upon Jehovah, as a burthen does upon a servant." This is a part of the fundamental idea running through the third part of Isaiah, closely connected with the mediatorial office of the "Servant of the Lord," who "bare the sin of many" (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>), and on whom "the Lord laid the iniquity of us all" (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). Israel, both during the Captivity and before, had accumulated a heavy load of sin, not merely by negligence, but by overt acts of guilt (see <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4, 15, 21-23</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/43-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have bought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7069.htm">Strong's 7069: </a> </span><span class="str2">To erect, create, to procure, by purchase, to own</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
