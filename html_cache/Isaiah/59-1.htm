The "arm of the LORD" is a metaphor for His power and might, often used throughout the Old Testament to describe His ability to intervene in human affairs (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>). In the context of Isaiah, this statement reassures the Israelites that despite their current circumstances, God's power to save is not diminished. Historically, the Israelites were facing threats from surrounding nations, and this assurance would have been crucial. Theologically, it points to God's unchanging nature and His ability to fulfill His promises, as seen in the deliverance from Egypt and the anticipated coming of the Messiah, who is the ultimate expression of God's saving power (<a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>).<p><b>nor His ear too dull to hear</b><br>This phrase highlights God's attentiveness and willingness to listen to the cries of His people. It counters any belief that God is indifferent or unresponsive to their prayers. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, gods of other nations were often seen as distant or needing to be appeased to gain their attention. In contrast, the God of Israel is portrayed as actively listening and engaged with His people. This assurance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states that the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their cry. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that God hears and answers prayer through Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

God is not speculating; He is declaring.<p>&#8226; Isaiah often uses firm language to remind Israel that the Lord&#8217;s promises never wobble (see <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>: &#8220;so My word&#8230; will not return to Me empty&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Because every promise of God is &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;Amen&#8221; in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>), we may read the rest of the verse with settled confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the arm of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Arm&#8221; pictures God&#8217;s active power. Isaiah has already asked, &#8220;To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), tying God&#8217;s strength to His saving work.<p>&#8226; From Egypt onward, the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;outstretched arm&#8221; accomplished real, historical deliverance (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not mere poetry; it is the literal, sovereign ability of God to intervene in human affairs whenever He chooses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is not too short</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s reach knows no geographical or spiritual limit. When Moses doubted provision in the wilderness, the Lord asked, &#8220;Is the LORD&#8217;s arm too short?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-23.htm">Numbers 11:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist echoes the same boundlessness: &#8220;Even there Your hand will guide me; Your right hand will hold me fast&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-10.htm">Psalm 139:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah adds, &#8220;Is anything too difficult for Me?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-27.htm">Jeremiah 32:27</a>). The expected answer is an emphatic &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to save</b><p>&#8226; Salvation here includes rescue from danger, exile, sin, and death. God declares, &#8220;Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>).<p>&#8226; In Jesus, that saving power is perfected: &#8220;He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>; see also <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Whenever we cry out in faith, we tap into an unshortened arm that can still lift, heal, and restore.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor His ear too dull</b><p>&#8226; God does not suffer hearing loss. &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; From Israel&#8217;s groans in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>) to the church&#8217;s petitions today (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>), His listening has never dimmed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a> puts it plainly: &#8220;He who affixed the ear, does He not hear?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to hear</b><p>&#8226; If prayers seem unanswered, the problem is never divine deafness. The very next verse explains: &#8220;Your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God&#8230; so that He will not hear&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeats the theme: &#8220;The LORD is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>; see also <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The solution is repentance and humility: &#8220;Then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a> insists that God&#8217;s power still reaches and His ears still listen.
