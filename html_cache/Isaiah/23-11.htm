The imagery of God stretching out His hand is reminiscent of His actions during the Exodus, where He parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). It underscores His control over natural elements and nations, emphasizing His ability to execute judgment and bring about His purposes. The sea here may also represent the Mediterranean, highlighting the reach of God's influence over the maritime powers, such as Tyre and Sidon, which were significant in trade and commerce.<p><b>He has made kingdoms tremble.</b><br>This indicates the fear and instability that God's judgment brings upon nations. The trembling of kingdoms suggests a divine intervention that disrupts the political and social order. Historically, this can be linked to the fall of powerful city-states like Tyre, which was a dominant maritime power. The trembling of kingdoms is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, where God's judgment is portrayed as a force that humbles the proud and mighty (<a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/50-46.htm">Jeremiah 50:46</a>). It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human power compared to God's eternal sovereignty.<p><b>He has given a command that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.</b><br>This phrase reflects God's direct intervention in the affairs of nations, particularly those in Canaan, which includes the Phoenician cities like Tyre and Sidon. The strongholds represent fortified cities and centers of power that are subject to God's judgment. Historically, this can be seen in the conquests by Assyrian and Babylonian empires, which were instruments of God's judgment. The destruction of these strongholds fulfills prophecies against nations that opposed God's people and purposes (<a href="/joshua/11-12.htm">Joshua 11:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/26-3.htm">Ezekiel 26:3-4</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ, who will destroy all spiritual strongholds and establish His kingdom (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who exercises authority over nations and seas.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Often symbolic of chaos and nations in biblical literature, representing the vast and uncontrollable forces of the world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdoms.htm">Kingdoms</a></b><br>Refers to the nations surrounding Israel, particularly those involved in trade and commerce, such as Tyre and Sidon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, representing the pagan nations and their strongholds that stand against God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/strongholds.htm">Strongholds</a></b><br>Fortified places or centers of power that are resistant to God's will, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their destinies.
