It indicates a time when the knowledge of God and His righteousness will be acknowledged universally. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of the end times when all nations will recognize the sovereignty of God, as echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where people from every nation worship God.<p><b>&#8220;Glory to the Righteous One.&#8221;</b><br>The "Righteous One" refers to God, highlighting His perfect justice and holiness. This title is also associated with Jesus Christ, who is seen as the embodiment of God's righteousness (<a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>). The declaration of glory to the Righteous One signifies a recognition of His divine authority and moral perfection, which is a central theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>But I said, &#8220;I am wasting away! I am wasting away! Woe is me.&#8221;</b><br>This expression of personal lament contrasts with the global praise. It reflects the prophet's awareness of the judgment and destruction that precedes the ultimate redemption. The repetition emphasizes the depth of despair and the physical and spiritual toll of witnessing such calamity. This mirrors the lamentations found in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Lamentations, where the prophets express sorrow over the sin and suffering of their people.<p><b>The treacherous betray; the treacherous deal in treachery.</b><br>This highlights the pervasive nature of sin and betrayal among people, even in times of divine revelation. It underscores the moral decay and unfaithfulness that characterize humanity, as seen throughout the history of Israel and in the broader biblical narrative. This treachery is often linked to the covenant unfaithfulness of Israel, as well as the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, serving as a reminder of the need for divine intervention and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_one.htm">The Righteous One</a></b><br>A reference to God, highlighting His holiness and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of the entire world, indicating the global recognition of God's glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_treacherous.htm">The Treacherous</a></b><br>Those who act deceitfully, betraying trust and causing destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_singing.htm">The Singing</a></b><br>Represents the praise and acknowledgment of God's glory by people worldwide.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/global_recognition_of_god's_glory.htm">Global Recognition of God's Glory</a></b><br>Despite the chaos and treachery in the world, God's glory will be acknowledged universally.

Two facts militate, however, against this view. The word translated "glory" is not that commonly used in doxologies, but rather "honour" or "praise," such as is applied to men (<a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-9.htm" title="The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.">Isaiah 23:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/28-4.htm" title="And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.">Isaiah 28:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm" title="The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!">2Samuel 1:19</a>). (2) The term "the Righteous One "is never used absolutely as a name of 'God. On these grounds, therefore, it seems better to render "honour to the righteous" (comp. <a href="/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>), to the true Israel of God as a righteous people.

The righteous remnant perceive that the calamities which have come upon the earth are ushering in a time of honor and glory for themselves; and they console themselves by making this fact the burden of some of their songs. Their honor, it must be remembered, is bound up with God's glory; which will not shine forth fully till their salvation is complete, and they "reign with him" in glory (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But I said, My leanness</span>. The thought of this joyful time, when the saints shall reign with their Lord in a new heaven and a new earth, recalls the prophet (contrast being one of the laws of the association of ideas) to the misery of the present, and his own participation therein. A time of suffering, of wasting, and pining away must be endured - for how long he knows not - before the joyous consummation, towards which he stretches in hope and confident expectancy, can be reached. This is the period of his "leanness." The <span class="cmt_word">treacherous dealers</span>, or ungodly of the earth, will bear sway during this period, and will <span class="cmt_word">deal treacherously</span> and cruelly with God's saints, persecuting them incessantly in a thousand ways. <span class="cmt_word">Have dealt</span>. The perfect of prophetic certainty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/24-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the ends</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#601;&#183;nap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
