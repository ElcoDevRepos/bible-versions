The oppression and affliction refer to the unjust treatment and physical suffering He experienced, particularly during His trial and crucifixion. This aligns with the New Testament accounts of Jesus' passion, where He faced false accusations and brutal treatment (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67-68</a>, <a href="/john/19.htm">John 19:1-3</a>). The Hebrew words used here convey a sense of being harshly treated and humiliated, reflecting the depth of His suffering.<p><b>yet He did not open His mouth</b><br>This emphasizes the Servant's silent submission in the face of suffering. In the Gospels, Jesus remains largely silent during His trials before the Sanhedrin and Pilate, fulfilling this prophecy (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>, <a href="/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3-5</a>). His silence can be seen as a demonstration of His obedience to God's will and His role as the sacrificial Lamb. This silence also contrasts with the natural human inclination to defend oneself, highlighting His unique character and mission.<p><b>He was led like a lamb to the slaughter</b><br>The imagery of a lamb is significant, as it connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where lambs were offered for atonement (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-32.htm">Leviticus 4:32-35</a>). This foreshadows Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The phrase suggests a willing submission to God's plan, as lambs were led without resistance. This typology underscores the sacrificial nature of Christ's death.<p><b>and as a sheep before her shearers is silent</b><br>This simile reinforces the idea of meekness and submission. Sheep are known for their docility, especially when being sheared. The Servant's silence before His accusers and executioners is a powerful testament to His humility and acceptance of His role as the suffering Messiah. This imagery would resonate with an agrarian society familiar with sheep shearing, emphasizing the Servant's peaceful acceptance of His fate.<p><b>so He did not open His mouth</b><br>Reiterating the earlier statement, this phrase underscores the deliberate and prophetic nature of the Servant's silence. It serves as a fulfillment of the prophecy and a testament to His character. The repetition highlights the importance of this aspect of the Servant's suffering, drawing attention to His fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through His willing sacrifice. This silence is a profound expression of His trust in God's justice and His commitment to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Christians traditionally interpret as a prophecy about Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who suffers for the sins of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book of Isaiah, delivering messages from God to the people of Israel, often foretelling the coming of the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Symbolically represents innocence and sacrifice.

In our Lord's silence before the Sanhedrin and Pilate it is allowable to trace a conscious fulfilment of Isaiah's words (<a href="/matthew/26-62.htm" title="And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?">Matthew 26:62</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-14.htm" title="And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor marveled greatly.">Matthew 27:14</a>).

The contrast of the Servant's silence and passivity with men's ordinary vehemence of self-assertion under ill usage is most striking. Who was ever silent but he under such extremity of provocation? (For a contrast, see the account of the Jewish martyrdoms in 2 Macc. 7.) <span class="cmt_word">He is brought as a lamb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as the lamb.</span> The Paschal lamb is, perhaps, intended, or, at any rate, the lamb of sacrifice.
