The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and had conquered many nations, each with its own deities. The rhetorical question highlights the perceived impotence of these gods against the might of Assyria. Historically, the Assyrians had a reputation for defeating nations and their gods, which they saw as proof of their own gods' superiority. This statement challenges the power of Yahweh, the God of Israel, by comparing Him to the defeated gods of other lands. It reflects the common ancient Near Eastern belief that military success was a sign of a god's power. This sets the stage for a demonstration of Yahweh's unique sovereignty and power, contrasting with the false gods of the nations.<p><b>How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?&#8221;</b><br>This challenge directly questions the ability of Yahweh to protect His people, Jerusalem, from the Assyrian threat. The use of "LORD" (Yahweh) is significant, as it is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His special relationship with Israel. The Assyrian's taunt is not just against the city but against the God of Israel Himself. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where God's power and faithfulness are tested in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Theologically, this sets up a test of faith for Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem, as well as an opportunity for God to demonstrate His power and faithfulness. The eventual deliverance of Jerusalem, as recorded later in <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>, serves as a powerful testament to God's sovereignty and His ability to save His people, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. This event is also a fulfillment of prophecy, as Isaiah had previously assured Hezekiah of God's protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered the message of intimidation to the people of Jerusalem, challenging their faith in the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Assyrian army, representing the focal point of God's promise and protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire of the time, known for its military might and conquests, posing a significant threat to Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose power and faithfulness are being challenged by the Assyrian envoy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the threats and intimidation from powerful forces, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate control and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>The challenge posed by Rabshakeh highlights the impotence of false gods compared to the living God, encouraging believers to examine where they place their trust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>The historical context underscores God's commitment to His covenant with Israel, reminding us of His faithfulness to His promises today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_response_to_crisis.htm">Prayer as a Response to Crisis</a></b><br>Hezekiah's response to seek God in prayer serves as a model for how believers should respond to challenges and threats.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_deliverance.htm">The Power of God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The eventual deliverance of Jerusalem serves as a testament to God's ability to save, encouraging believers to have faith in His power to intervene in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_36_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 36:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_36_20_God_s_rule_questioned.htm">How does Isaiah 36:20 challenge our understanding of God's sovereignty over nations?
