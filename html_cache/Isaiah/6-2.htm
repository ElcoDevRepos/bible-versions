Their position "above Him" signifies their role in the heavenly hierarchy, serving and worshiping God. The term "seraphim" is derived from a Hebrew root meaning "to burn," indicating their fiery nature and purity. This vision of seraphim is unique to Isaiah, emphasizing the holiness and majesty of God. In the broader biblical context, angels often appear in significant moments of divine revelation, such as in <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>.<p><b>each having six wings</b><br>The six wings of the seraphim symbolize their readiness and ability to serve God. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, where the living creatures around God's throne also have six wings. The number six, often associated with imperfection in biblical numerology, here highlights the completeness of their service and worship, as they are fully equipped to fulfill their divine roles.<p><b>With two wings they covered their faces</b><br>Covering their faces signifies reverence and humility before God's overwhelming holiness and glory. Even these exalted beings cannot gaze directly upon the divine presence, underscoring the transcendence and otherness of God. This act of covering is reminiscent of Moses covering his face after speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33-35</a>), illustrating the profound respect required in the presence of the divine.<p><b>with two they covered their feet</b><br>Covering their feet suggests modesty and the acknowledgment of their creatureliness before the Creator. In the ancient Near Eastern context, feet were often considered unclean or a symbol of one's earthly journey. By covering their feet, the seraphim demonstrate their awareness of their position as created beings, despite their exalted status.<p><b>and with two they were flying</b><br>The act of flying indicates their readiness to act on God's commands, symbolizing swift obedience and service. This imagery reflects the biblical theme of angels as messengers and servants of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, where angels are described as mighty ones who do God's bidding. The continuous motion of flying also suggests the ceaseless nature of their worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision of the Lord seated on a high and exalted throne.

John later describes &#8220;four living creatures&#8230; each with six wings&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>), echoing Isaiah&#8217;s report and reinforcing its accuracy.<p>&#8226; The multiplicity of wings points to specialized service&#8212;different pairs for different purposes&#8212;rather than careless excess. God equips His servants precisely for their assigned roles (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>,14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With two they covered their faces</b><p>&#8226; Even sinless seraphim shield their eyes from the blazing holiness of God. Moses had to hide in the cleft of the rock (<a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22&#8211;23</a>); here, the seraphim do the same with their wings.<p>&#8226; The gesture highlights God&#8217;s unapproachable light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). If holy angels cannot gaze fully upon Him, how much more should redeemed people approach with reverence (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underscores that true worship begins with awe rather than familiarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with two they covered their feet</b><p>&#8226; Feet often symbolize creatureliness and activity. By veiling their feet, the seraphim acknowledge the difference between Creator and creation (<a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; This echoes God&#8217;s command to Moses: &#8220;Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Covering their lower parts proclaims, &#8220;Nothing about us is worthy to stand exposed before You.&#8221; Their humility models the posture every believer should adopt (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with two they were flying</b><p>&#8226; The final pair of wings stays in motion&#8212;ready service.

Likewise, believers offer their bodies &#8220;as living sacrifices&#8221; while remaining eager to serve (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> pulls back the curtain on the throne room of heaven. Real seraphim hover above the Sovereign Lord, equipped with six wings: two for veiling their faces in awe, two for covering their feet in humility, and two for active, obedient service. Their posture teaches that genuine worship unites reverence, humility, and readiness to obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Above it stood the seraphims . . .</span>--It is noticeable that this is the only passage in which the seraphim are mentioned as part of the host of heaven. In <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm" title="And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.">Numbers 21:6</a>, the word (the primary meaning of which is <span class= "ital">the burning ones</span>) occurs as denoting the fiery serpents that attacked the people in the wilderness. Probably the brazen serpent which Hezekiah afterwards destroyed (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>) had preserved the name and its significance as denoting the instruments of the fiery judgments of Jehovah. Here, however, there is no trace of the serpent form, nor again, as far as the description goes, of the animal forms of the cherubim of <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-5.htm" title="Also out of the middle thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.">Ezekiel 1:5-11</a>, and of the "living creatures<span class= "ital">" </span>of <a href="/context/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7-8</a>. The "burning ones" are in the likeness of men, with the addition of the six wings. The patristic and mediaeval distinction between the seraphim that excel in love, and the cherubim that excel in knowledge, rests apparently on the etymology of the former word. The "living creatures" of <a href="/context/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7-8</a>, seem to unite the forms of the cherubim of Ezekiel with the six wings of the seraphim of this passage. Symbolically the seraphim would seem to be as transfigured cherubim, representing the "flaming fire" of the lightning, as the latter did the storm-winds and other elemental forces of nature (<a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Above it stood the seraphims</span>; rather, <span class="accented">above him were standing seraphim</span>. The "seraphim" are introduced, not as well known, with the article, but without it, as unknown. The word means "fiery ones," and is supposed to denote the burning love of the blessed spirits spoken cf. They appeared to the prophet as standing above the King as he sat upon his throne - "standing" to show their readiness to minister; but why "above him" is not so clear. Perhaps, simply, as those that stand are "above" those that sit; perhaps as ready to fly through infinite space at the bidding of him who was seated in his palace, as it were upon the ground. Their form, as seen by the prophet, appears to have been human, and only distinguished from ordinary humanity by the wings. Thus, though in name they resembled those other "fiery ones," which had punished the Jews in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6-9</a>), there is nothing to show that Isaiah in any way connected the two. <span class="cmt_word">Each one had six wings</span>. Gesenius is mistaken in saying that there are at Persepolis any six-winged figures ('Thesaurus,' p. 1342). The Persians not infrequently represented their genii with four wings ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 353, 354); but no six-winged figures have been found, so far as I know, among the Persian remains. <span class="cmt_word">With twain he covered his face</span>, etc. The general idea of the six wings was probably rapid flight, the carrying out of God's behests "with speed swiftly." But, in the Divine presence, the wings were applied to a different use. One pair veiled the seraph's head from the intolerable effulgence of the Divine glory; another concealed the feet, soiled in their various ministrations, and unmeet for the all-pure presence; the third pair alone sustained the seraph in mid-air, as he hovered in readiness to depart on any errand on which Jehovah aright send him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Above</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
