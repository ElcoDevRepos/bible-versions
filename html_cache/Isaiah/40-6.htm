The "voice" is often interpreted as a prophetic voice, possibly Isaiah's, or a heavenly messenger. This command reflects the urgency and importance of the message, emphasizing the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces. The imperative to "cry out" suggests a public declaration, aligning with the prophetic tradition of delivering God's word to the people.<p><b>And I asked, &#8220;What should I cry out?&#8221;</b><br>This response shows a willingness to obey but also a need for clarity. It reflects the prophet's humility and dependence on God for guidance. The question indicates a readiness to serve but also a recognition of the weight of the message. This interaction mirrors other biblical instances where prophets seek specific instructions from God, highlighting the relational aspect of divine communication.<p><b>&#8220;All flesh is like grass,</b><br>This metaphor emphasizes the transience and frailty of human life. In the biblical context, "flesh" refers to humanity in its mortal state. The comparison to grass, which withers quickly, underscores the temporary nature of human existence. This imagery is common in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>, reinforcing the theme of human mortality contrasted with God's eternal nature.<p><b>and all its glory like the flowers of the field.</b><br>The "glory" of humanity, representing achievements, beauty, and strength, is likened to flowers, which are beautiful but short-lived. This highlights the fleeting nature of human accomplishments and status. In the cultural context, flowers were often used to symbolize beauty and prosperity, yet their impermanence serves as a reminder of the limitations of human glory. This imagery points to the need for reliance on God's eternal promises rather than human endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who received and conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel.

The truth which he is to enforce thus solemnly is the ever-recurring contrast between the transitoriness of man and the eternity of God and of His word, taking that term in its highest and widest sense. Two points of interest may be noted: (1) that this is another parallelism with Job (<a href="/job/14-2.htm" title="He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not.">Job 14:2</a>); (2) the naturalness of the thought in one who, like Isaiah, was looking back, as Moses looked (<a href="/context/psalms/90-5.htm" title="You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which grows up.">Psalm 90:5-6</a>) in extreme old age upon the generations whom he had survived, and forward to the fall of mighty monarchies one after another. The marginal references show how dominant the thought is in the mind of Isaiah. Isaiah himself had uttered it in <a href="/isaiah/2-22.htm" title="Cease you from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?">Isaiah 2:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice said, Cry;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">voice of else that sayeth</span>, <span class="accented">Cry.</span> It is a second voice, distinct from that of ver. 3, that now reaches the prophet's ear - a voice responded to by another. The speakers seem to be angels, who contrast the perishable nature of man with the enduringness and unchangingness of God. The point of their discourse is that "the Word of the Lord endureth for ever" (ver. 8), and therefore the preceding promises (vers. 2, 5) are sure. <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and one said.</span> A second voice answered the first, and asked what the proclamation was to be.
