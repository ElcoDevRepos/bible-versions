In ancient times, highways were significant for trade and communication, often built by kings to connect their territories. Spiritually, this highway represents God's intervention to remove obstacles, ensuring safe passage for His people. It echoes the theme of God making a way where there seems to be none, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where a voice cries out to prepare the way of the Lord.<p><b>for the remnant of His people</b><br>The term "remnant" refers to a small, faithful group preserved by God through trials and judgment. Throughout the Bible, God consistently preserves a remnant to fulfill His promises, as seen in the stories of Noah, Elijah, and the return from Babylonian exile. This remnant is a testament to God's faithfulness and mercy, ensuring the continuation of His covenant people.<p><b>who remain from Assyria</b><br>Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and cruelty, often used by God as an instrument of judgment against Israel. The mention of Assyria highlights the historical context of Israel's captivity and the subsequent promise of deliverance. This deliverance from Assyria serves as a type of the ultimate deliverance from sin and oppression through Christ.<p><b>as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase draws a parallel to the Exodus, the foundational event of Israel's history, where God delivered His people from slavery in Egypt. The miraculous crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) is a powerful image of God's saving power and faithfulness. This comparison emphasizes that just as God provided a way for Israel in the past, He will do so again for His people, reinforcing the theme of redemption and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's prophecies often focus on the coming Messiah and the restoration of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_his_people.htm">Remnant of His People</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful Israelites who survive the judgment and exile, symbolizing hope and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire during Isaiah's time, known for conquering the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often depicted in the Bible as being delivered from oppression and exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites in the Exodus, symbolizing liberation and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_deliverance.htm">God's Faithfulness in Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as God provided a way for Israel out of Egypt, He promises to deliver His people from all forms of bondage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_as_a_symbol_of_hope.htm">The Remnant as a Symbol of Hope</a></b><br>The concept of a remnant assures believers that God always preserves a faithful group, even in times of widespread unfaithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_highway_as_a_path_of_righteousness.htm">The Highway as a Path of Righteousness</a></b><br>The "highway" symbolizes a clear path to God, emphasizing the importance of walking in His ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_fulfillment_and_future_promise.htm">Historical Fulfillment and Future Promise</a></b><br>While the prophecy had historical fulfillment, it also points to the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's plan and timing, knowing He is sovereign over nations and history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_11_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_11_16_Christ_as_Deliverer.htm">How does Isaiah 11:16 foreshadow Christ's role as a deliverer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_11_16_Historical_event.htm">What historical event does "a highway for the remnant" in Isaiah 11:16 reference?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_11_16_Hope_in_God_s_promises.htm">How can Isaiah 11:16 inspire hope in God's promises today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_11_16_Exodus_14_29_Similar.htm">Connect Isaiah 11:16 with Exodus 14:29.
