The "fear of the LORD" is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The Messiah's delight in this fear indicates His perfect alignment with God's will, contrasting with human leaders who may act out of self-interest. This delight is not burdensome but a source of joy and fulfillment, reflecting the intimate relationship between the Messiah and God. The Hebrew word for "delight" can also imply a sense of pleasure or satisfaction, suggesting that the Messiah finds His greatest joy in honoring and obeying God.<p><b>He will not judge by what His eyes see,</b><br>This phrase highlights the Messiah's ability to judge beyond mere appearances. Unlike human judges who can be swayed by external factors or deception, the Messiah possesses divine insight. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The Messiah's judgment is based on truth and righteousness, not superficial observations. This ability to see beyond the surface is a divine attribute, underscoring the Messiah's role as a just and fair ruler. It also points to His omniscience, a quality that sets Him apart from all other leaders.<p><b>and He will not decide by what His ears hear,</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this indicates that the Messiah's decisions are not influenced by hearsay or false testimony. In ancient times, as today, leaders could be misled by rumors or biased reports. The Messiah, however, discerns the truth with perfect clarity. This ability to judge rightly is prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, where the Servant of the LORD brings forth justice. The Messiah's decisions are based on divine wisdom and understanding, ensuring that His judgments are fair and just. This characteristic is essential for establishing a kingdom of peace and righteousness, as described in the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Isaiah 11 is a prophetic passage about the coming Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
