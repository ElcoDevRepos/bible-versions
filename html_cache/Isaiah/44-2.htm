As "Maker," God is acknowledged as the Creator of all things, including Israel. This highlights His authority and power, as well as His intimate involvement in the creation and sustenance of His people. The concept of God as Creator is foundational in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> and is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-14</a>, where God&#8217;s role in forming individuals is celebrated.<p><b>who formed you from the womb</b><br>This phrase underscores God's intimate knowledge and care for His people from the very beginning of their existence. It reflects the personal relationship God has with Israel, akin to a potter shaping clay, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>. The imagery of being formed in the womb is also found in <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God speaks of knowing and consecrating Jeremiah before his birth, indicating divine purpose and election.<p><b>and who will help you</b><br>God's promise to help signifies His ongoing commitment to His people. This assurance of divine assistance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where God promises to never leave nor forsake His people. It reflects God's faithfulness and His role as a protector and provider, reinforcing the covenant relationship.<p><b>Do not be afraid, O Jacob My servant</b><br>The command "Do not be afraid" is a common biblical exhortation, often given in times of uncertainty or fear. "Jacob" refers to the patriarch whose name was later changed to Israel, symbolizing the nation as a whole. As "My servant," Israel is reminded of their role and identity in God's plan. This phrase reassures them of God's presence and protection, similar to the encouragement given to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>.<p><b>Jeshurun, whom I have chosen</b><br>"Jeshurun" is a poetic name for Israel, meaning "upright one," used in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15 and 33</a>:5, 26. It reflects an idealized vision of Israel as righteous and faithful. The phrase "whom I have chosen" emphasizes God's sovereign election of Israel as His people, a theme central to the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>. This choice is not based on Israel's merit but on God's love and purpose, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the Creator and Sustainer of all things. He is the one speaking in this verse, offering assurance and help.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, who was renamed Israel. Jacob is often used to refer to the collective people of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeshurun.htm">Jeshurun</a></b><br>A poetic name for Israel, meaning "upright one" or "beloved one."

"Jacob" marks them simply as descendants of the patriarch - the people to whom the promises were made. "Israel" marks their militant character - that as "God's soldiers" they fought his battles and maintained his cause in the midst of a hostile world. The third name, "Jeshurun," which is very rarely used (only here and in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5, 26</a>), designates them as "righteous," being a derivative from the root <span class="accented">yashar</span> (or <span class="accented">joshar</span>), equivalent to "upright," and points to that standard of moral excellence which it was their duty to set forth, and which to some extent they did set forth, in a world that "lay in wickedness."
