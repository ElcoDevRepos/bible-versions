In the context of Isaiah, it points to a period when God will act decisively in history. The phrase is used throughout the prophetic books to denote a time when God's purposes will be fulfilled, often associated with both judgment and restoration.<p><b>men will look to their Maker</b><br>The term "Maker" emphasizes God as the Creator, reminding the people of their dependence on Him. This looking to God signifies a turning away from idolatry and self-reliance, a theme prevalent in Isaiah. It reflects a return to acknowledging God&#8217;s sovereignty and a recognition of His role as the ultimate source of life and sustenance.<p><b>and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel</b><br>The "Holy One of Israel" is a title frequently used in Isaiah, highlighting God's holiness and His special relationship with Israel. This turning of eyes suggests repentance and a renewed focus on God. It implies a shift from false gods and worldly distractions to a sincere devotion to the true God. This phrase also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, embodying holiness and divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel and Judah, who are being called to repentance and recognition of God as their Creator.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/maker.htm">Maker</a></b><br>This term refers to God as the Creator of all things, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority over creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_one_of_israel.htm">Holy One of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God that underscores His holiness, separateness, and unique relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/that_day.htm">That Day</a></b><br>A prophetic term often used to denote a future time of judgment or redemption, depending on the context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often used in prophetic literature to represent God's people collectively.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_god_as_creator.htm">Recognition of God as Creator</a></b><br>Acknowledge God as the ultimate authority and source of life.
