The "anguish" signifies the depth of His suffering, both physically and spiritually, as He bore the sins of humanity. This aligns with the New Testament accounts of Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-39</a>) and His cry of abandonment on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>).<p><b>He will see the light of life and be satisfied</b><br>This phrase is often understood as a reference to the resurrection. "The light of life" symbolizes the victory over death and the new life that follows. The satisfaction comes from the fulfillment of His mission to redeem humanity. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' resurrection is seen as the ultimate triumph over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><b>By His knowledge My righteous Servant will justify many</b><br>The "knowledge" here can be interpreted as the experiential knowledge of suffering and obedience that the Servant gains through His trials. "My righteous Servant" emphasizes the sinless nature of the Servant, who is able to justify many because of His righteousness. This justification is a legal term, meaning to be declared righteous, and is a central theme in Paul's writings, particularly in <a href="/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18-19</a>, where the obedience of Christ leads to justification for many.<p><b>and He will bear their iniquities</b><br>This phrase highlights the substitutionary atonement, where the Servant takes upon Himself the sins of others. The concept of bearing iniquities is rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where a lamb or goat would bear the sins of the people (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21-22</a>). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Jesus, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_servant.htm">The Righteous Servant</a></b><br>This refers to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is prophesied to suffer and bear the sins of many.

Without that knowledge He could not have led them to know God as He knew.

Nothing is so effectual in turning men to righteousness as teaching them the true knowledge of God - his nature, his purposes with regard to them, his feelings towards them. Christ, from his own knowledge, gave men this knowledge, and so did all that could be done to draw them to his Father. And his efforts were not without result. The fruit of his teaching has been the justification of many - ay, of "the many," as both Isaiah and St. Paul (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>) testify. For he shall bear their iniquities; rather, <span class="accented">and their iniquities he himself shall bear.</span> The initial part of the clause is not "causal," but merely connective. There are two main things which Christ does for his people - he makes them righteous by infusing into them of his own righteousness; and he bears the burden of their iniquities, taking them upon himself, and by his perpetual intercession obtaining God's forgiveness of them. As Delitzsch says, "His continued taking of our trespasses upon himself is merely the constant presence and presentation of his atonement, which has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of his one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute the blessings which he has acquired" ('Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2:p. 338). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/53-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After the anguish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;mal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
