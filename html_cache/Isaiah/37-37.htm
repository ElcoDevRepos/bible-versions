Sennacherib, the powerful king of Assyria, had previously threatened Jerusalem, boasting of his conquests and mocking the God of Israel. The withdrawal signifies a miraculous deliverance for Jerusalem, as recorded earlier in <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>, where an angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. This event underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to protect His people against seemingly insurmountable odds. Historically, Assyrian records, such as the Taylor Prism, corroborate Sennacherib's campaign in Judah but notably omit the capture of Jerusalem, aligning with the biblical account of his retreat.<p><b>He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.</b><br>Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, a city known for its grandeur and later for its wickedness, as described in the book of Jonah. Sennacherib's return to Nineveh signifies a retreat to his stronghold, marking a shift from his aggressive expansionist policies. This phrase also foreshadows Sennacherib's eventual assassination by his own sons, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/37-7.htm">Isaiah 37:7</a>. Theologically, Nineveh's mention serves as a reminder of God's judgment and mercy, as the city would later be the focus of Jonah's reluctant mission and eventual repentance. The Assyrian Empire, despite its might, was subject to the divine will, illustrating the transient nature of earthly powers in contrast to God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, known for his military campaigns and attempts to conquer Jerusalem.

For believers, the line is a concise testimony that God keeps His promises, defends His people, and turns the mightiest armies away with a word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">So Sennacherib . . .</span>--We have to remember that the Assyrian king had been engaged in the siege of Libnah, probably also in an Egyptian expedition, which from some cause or other was unsuccessful.

Sennacherib lived some eighteen or twenty years from the probable date of his discomfiture, dying in <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. His ordinary residence was at Nineveh, which he greatly adorned and beautified ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. pp. 55-57). His father, Sargon, on the contrary, dwelt commonly at Khorsabad (Dur-Sargina), and his son, Esarhaddon, dwelt, during the latter part of his reign, at Babylon. We must not suppose, however, that Sennacherib was shut up in Nineveh during the remainder of his life. On the contrary, he made frequent expeditions towards the south, the east, and the north. But he made no farther expedition to the south-west, no further attack on Jerusalem, or attempt on Egypt. The Jews had peace, so far as the Assyrians were concerned, from the event related in ver. 36 to a late date in the reign of Esarhaddon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Sennacherib</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(san&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;r&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5576.htm">Strong's 5576: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sennacherib -- a king of Assyr</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Assyria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">broke camp</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;sa&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
