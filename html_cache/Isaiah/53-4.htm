In the context of Isaiah, this is a prophetic reference to the Messiah, who would take upon Himself the physical and spiritual ailments of the people. The Hebrew word for "infirmities" can also mean sicknesses, suggesting a comprehensive bearing of human frailty. This is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Jesus is seen healing the sick and casting out demons, as in <a href="/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>, which directly quotes this passage to describe Jesus' healing ministry.<p><b>and carried our sorrows;</b><br>The Servant not only takes on physical ailments but also the emotional and spiritual burdens of humanity. The term "sorrows" encompasses grief and pain, indicating a deep empathy and identification with human suffering. This reflects the compassionate nature of the Messiah, who is intimately acquainted with the human condition. In the Gospels, Jesus is portrayed as one who weeps with those who mourn (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>) and offers rest to the weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>yet we considered Him stricken,</b><br>Despite His role as a bearer of burdens, the Servant is misunderstood and misjudged by those He came to save. The term "stricken" implies being struck down or afflicted, often associated with divine punishment. This reflects the cultural and religious misunderstanding of the time, where suffering was often seen as a result of personal sin or divine displeasure. This misjudgment is evident in the crucifixion of Jesus, where He was mocked and scorned as one cursed by God (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-43</a>).<p><b>struck down by God,</b><br>This phrase suggests that the Servant's suffering was perceived as a direct act of divine judgment. In the historical context, being "struck down by God" would imply that the individual was under God's curse or wrath. However, the prophetic insight here is that the Servant's suffering was part of God's redemptive plan, not a result of His own sin. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' crucifixion is understood as a necessary part of God's plan for salvation (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><b>and afflicted.</b><br>The term "afflicted" denotes a state of being oppressed or humiliated. This highlights the depth of the Servant's suffering and the extent of His identification with human pain. The affliction of the Servant is a key theme in the passion narratives of the Gospels, where Jesus endures mockery, torture, and ultimately death. This affliction is not without purpose, as it leads to the ultimate victory over sin and death, fulfilling the redemptive mission foretold by Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This is a prophetic reference to Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the prophecy in the New Testament.

Having set forth at length the fact of the Servant's humiliation (vers. 2, 3), the prophet hastens to declare the reason of it. Twelve times over within the space of nine verses he asserts. with the most emphatic reiteration, that all the Servant's sufferings were vicarious, borne for him, to save him from the consequences of his sins, to enable him to escape punishment. The doctrine thus taught in the Old Testament is set forth! with equal distinctness in the New (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50-52</a>; <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.), and forms the hope, the trust, and the consolation of Christians. and carried our sorrows.

Christ's sufferings were the remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to. <span class="cmt_word">Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God</span>. They who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. Hence they scoffed at him and reviled him, even in his greatest agonies (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). To one only, and him not one of God's people, was it given to see the contrary, and to declare aloud, at the moment of the death, "Certainly this was a righteous Man" (<a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/53-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_403.htm">Strong's 403: </a> </span><span class="str2">Firmly, surely, but</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our infirmities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1459;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1433;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;o&#183;l&#257;&#183;y&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
