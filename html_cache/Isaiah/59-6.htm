In the ancient Near East, clothing was a basic necessity, symbolizing protection and dignity. Cobwebs, being delicate and insubstantial, represent the ineffectiveness of their efforts to cover their spiritual nakedness. This imagery echoes <a href="/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14-15</a>, where the hope of the godless is compared to a spider's web. The use of cobwebs suggests that their attempts to justify themselves or find security in their own works are as ineffective as trying to make clothing from spider silk.<p><b>and they cannot cover themselves with their works</b><br>The inability to cover themselves with their works highlights the insufficiency of human efforts to achieve righteousness. This reflects the broader biblical theme that salvation and righteousness cannot be attained through human deeds but are gifts from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The imagery of covering oneself is reminiscent of Adam and Eve's attempt to cover their nakedness with fig leaves (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>), which was inadequate until God provided garments of skin (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>), symbolizing divine provision and grace.<p><b>Their deeds are sinful deeds</b><br>This phrase underscores the nature of the people's actions as inherently sinful. The repetition emphasizes the pervasive corruption and moral failure of the society. In the context of Isaiah, this reflects the broader theme of Israel's rebellion against God and the resulting judgment. The concept of sin as a pervasive problem is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<p><b>and acts of violence are in their hands</b><br>The mention of violence indicates the tangible and destructive nature of their sin. In the historical context of Isaiah, violence was a common issue, often associated with injustice and oppression. This phrase connects to the broader biblical condemnation of violence and injustice, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> and <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>. The imagery of violence being "in their hands" suggests active participation and responsibility, highlighting the need for repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
