In the context of Isaiah, this underscores God's sovereignty and the inadequacy of human efforts in achieving divine purposes. The imagery of God looking for help but finding none is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, where God sought someone to stand in the gap but found no one. It emphasizes the theme of divine initiative and the futility of relying on human strength.<p><b>I was appalled that no one assisted.</b><br>The term "appalled" conveys a sense of astonishment and disappointment at the lack of support. This reflects God's righteous indignation at the failure of humanity to uphold justice and righteousness. Historically, this can be seen in the context of Israel's repeated failures to live up to their covenantal responsibilities. The cultural backdrop of ancient Near Eastern societies often involved gods needing assistance from humans or other deities, but here, the God of Israel stands alone, highlighting His uniqueness and self-sufficiency.<p><b>So My arm brought Me salvation,</b><br>The "arm" of God is a metaphor for His power and might, often used in the Old Testament to describe His intervention in history (e.g., <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This phrase indicates that salvation is achieved solely through God's power, without human aid. It foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the "arm of the Lord" (<a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), who brings ultimate salvation through His death and resurrection. This typology points to the messianic fulfillment in Christ, who accomplishes what humanity cannot.<p><b>and My own wrath upheld Me.</b><br>God's wrath here is not capricious anger but a righteous response to sin and injustice. It is His zeal for holiness and justice that sustains His actions. This phrase suggests that God's wrath is an integral part of His character, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled. In the broader biblical narrative, God's wrath is often a precursor to redemption, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the ultimate salvation through Christ. Theologically, it underscores the necessity of divine judgment as a prelude to salvation, a theme echoed in the eschatological visions of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His disappointment at the lack of assistance and His decision to act alone.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arm_of_the_lord.htm">The Arm of the Lord</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and intervention, often associated with deliverance and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The deliverance or rescue that God brings about through His own power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrath.htm">Wrath</a></b><br>The righteous anger of God, which supports His actions and judgments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The implied recipients of God's salvation and judgment, though not directly mentioned in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is fully capable of executing His plans without human assistance.

Like a watchman on the wall, He surveys every heart and every nation to see who will stand with Him. Scripture repeatedly portrays God &#8220;looking&#8221; in this way: &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a> He says, &#8220;These are the ones I will look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit.&#8221; The divine gaze is thorough and intentional, revealing that God never acts blindly but always out of perfect knowledge of every situation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but there was no one to help</b><p>Here comes the heartbreaking discovery: no ally, no advocate, no defender arises. Humanity, riddled with sin, offers no worthy champion. The same refrain appears earlier: &#8220;He saw that there was no one, He was amazed that there was no one to intercede&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>). We sense the echo of <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a> where God &#8220;sought a man to stand in the gap&#8230;but found none.&#8221; The absence is not accidental; it exposes the total inability of fallen people to rescue themselves or others from God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was appalled that no one assisted</b><p>The word &#8220;appalled&#8221; lets us feel the emotional weight of this vacancy. God is not indifferent&#8212;He is grieved by our failure to respond. Think of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>) or mourning the hardness of hearts in <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>. God&#8217;s astonishment is moral, not ignorant surprise; He is expressing righteous indignation that, despite abundant revelation and opportunity, no one steps forward in faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So My arm brought Me salvation</b><p>When no human helper appears, God acts alone. &#8220;The LORD has made His salvation known and revealed His righteousness to the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1-3</a>). The &#8220;arm&#8221; symbolizes His own strength, His direct intervention. <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD has bared His holy arm in the sight of all nations,&#8221; prefiguring the incarnation of Christ, who is called &#8220;the arm of the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>. At the cross and through the empty tomb, God single-handedly accomplished the rescue we could never achieve, fulfilling His covenant promises without human aid.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and My own wrath upheld Me</b><p>God&#8217;s wrath is not a loss of control; it is His settled, righteous opposition to sin. That wrath &#8220;upholds&#8221; Him in the sense that His justice undergirds His actions. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a> explains that God displayed Christ &#8220;to demonstrate His righteousness&#8230;so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.&#8221; Divine wrath and divine love converge at Calvary: judgment poured out on sin, salvation provided to sinners. The same wrath that once threatened us is spent on Christ, securing everlasting deliverance for all who believe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a> paints a vivid picture of God searching, finding no human partner, and therefore stepping in with His own mighty arm to accomplish salvation while His righteous wrath sustains the moral integrity of the act. We are reminded of our complete dependence on the Lord, the sufficiency of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, and the awe-inspiring harmony of divine love and justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/63.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">I looked . . .</span>--As in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>, the absolute isolation of the avenger and redeemer is emphasised again and again.
