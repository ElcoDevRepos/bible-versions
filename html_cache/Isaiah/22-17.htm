In the historical context, Shebna was a high-ranking official in King Hezekiah's court, responsible for the royal household. The term "mighty man" underscores his authority and the respect he commanded. However, the address also carries a tone of irony, as his power is about to be challenged by God. This serves as a reminder of the biblical theme that human strength and status are ultimately subject to divine authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a> and <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>.<p><b>The LORD is about to shake you violently.</b><br>This imagery of shaking suggests a dramatic upheaval or removal from a position of power. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, such language would evoke the idea of instability and judgment. The shaking signifies God's direct intervention, a common motif in prophetic literature where God disrupts the status quo to bring about His purposes. This can be compared to <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>, where God promises to shake the heavens and the earth. Theologically, it reflects the sovereignty of God over nations and leaders, emphasizing that no earthly power can withstand His will.<p><b>He will take hold of you,</b><br>The phrase indicates a personal and decisive action by God. In the biblical narrative, when God "takes hold" of someone, it often signifies a change in their circumstances or a redirection of their path, as seen in the calling of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). This action implies that Shebna's fate is now in God's hands, highlighting the theme of divine control over human affairs. It also foreshadows the removal of Shebna from his position, as God appoints Eliakim in his place (<a href="/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20-21</a>). This serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's righteous leadership, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>, where Christ holds the key of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
