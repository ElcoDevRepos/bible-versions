Hezekiah was known for his faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-7</a>, where he is described as a king who trusted in the Lord. The Assyrian strategy was to sow doubt and fear among the people, encouraging them to abandon their leader. This tactic is reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where doubt is cast on God's word.<p><b>for this is what the king of Assyria says:</b><br>The king of Assyria, likely Sennacherib at this time, represents the world powers that often stand in opposition to God's people. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and brutal conquests. The Assyrian king's words are a direct challenge to the authority of God, similar to Goliath's defiance in <a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>.<p><b>Make peace with me and come out to me.</b><br>This invitation to make peace is a deceptive offer, as true peace cannot be found in submission to a pagan king. The phrase echoes the temptation of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8-9</a>, where Satan offers the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship. The call to "come out" suggests leaving the protection of God, akin to Lot's wife looking back at Sodom in <a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>.<p><b>Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree,</b><br>The imagery of the vine and fig tree symbolizes prosperity and security, as seen in <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>, where it describes a time of peace under God's rule. However, the Assyrian promise is a counterfeit, offering material comfort in exchange for spiritual compromise. This reflects the false peace offered by the world, contrasting with the true peace found in Christ (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>and drink water from his own cistern,</b><br>Water is a symbol of life and sustenance in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of the living water He provides. The promise of drinking from one's own cistern suggests self-sufficiency, but it is ultimately a false security. <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> condemns forsaking God, the "spring of living water," for broken cisterns that cannot hold water.

Yet <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> warns of &#8220;broken cisterns that cannot hold water,&#8221; contrasting them with the &#8220;spring of living water&#8221; found only in the LORD.<p>&#8226; Isaiah had already invited Judah to &#8220;draw water from the springs of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>), so Assyria&#8217;s offer again twists a divine gift into a bargaining chip.<p>&#8226; Ultimately, real security flows from trusting the LORD, not from accepting terms set by enemies (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16</a> records a sophisticated assault on faith: discredit God&#8217;s leader, exalt human authority, promise peace through surrender, and cloak it all in language that mimics God&#8217;s own blessings. The verse exposes a perennial temptation&#8212;to abandon confident trust in the LORD for immediate but hollow guarantees. Judah&#8217;s choice, and ours today, is clear: heed deceptive voices that promise comfort on their terms or stand firm on the unfailing word of God who alone secures true peace and provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make an agreement with me by a present</span>; literally, <span class="accented">make a blessing with me.</span> Delitzsch paraphrases, "Enter into a connection of mutual good wishes with me." Vance Smith translates boldly, "Make <span class="accented">peace</span> with me;" and Mr. Cheyne, "Make a treaty with me." There seems to be no doubt that <span class="accented">b'rakah</span>, besides its primary sense of "blessing," had two secondary senses, "present" and "treaty." Here "treaty" is no doubt intended.

They would be safe front the terrible extremities hinted at in ver. 12, and might confidently await the great king's ultimate disposal of them, which would be determined widen the war in these parts was over.
