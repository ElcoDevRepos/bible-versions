In ancient Near Eastern culture, the bond between a mother and her nursing child was considered one of the strongest human connections. The rhetorical question implies that it is almost unthinkable for a mother to forget her nursing child, emphasizing the depth of God's love and commitment to His people. This imagery is used to illustrate God's unwavering faithfulness, contrasting human forgetfulness with divine remembrance.<p><b>or lack compassion for the son of her womb?</b><br>The phrase underscores the deep-seated compassion a mother has for her child, which is rooted in the very act of giving birth. In biblical times, the womb was often seen as a place of life and blessing, and the relationship between a mother and her child was sacred. This comparison serves to highlight the intensity of God's compassion for His people, suggesting that even if human compassion fails, God's compassion is steadfast. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, which speaks of God's compassion being like that of a father for his children.<p><b>Even if she could forget</b><br>Here, the hypothetical scenario is presented where a mother might forget her child, which is highly unlikely but not impossible. This serves to emphasize the contrast between human frailty and divine constancy. The possibility of a mother forgetting her child, though rare, is used to highlight the certainty of God's memory and care. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8-9</a>, where God's love persists despite Israel's waywardness.<p><b>I will not forget you!</b><br>This declaration is a powerful assurance of God's eternal remembrance and commitment to His people. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises never to abandon or forsake them. This promise is consistent with the overarching narrative of the Bible, where God remains faithful to His promises despite human failure. The assurance of God's remembrance is a source of hope and comfort, echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>, where God promises never to leave nor forsake His people. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate expression of God's faithfulness in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's eternal commitment to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
