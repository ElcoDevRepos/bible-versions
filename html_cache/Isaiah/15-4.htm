Heshbon was a major city of the Amorites before being conquered by the Israelites under Moses (<a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25-26</a>). Elealeh was nearby and often mentioned alongside Heshbon (<a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 37</a>). The cry from these cities signifies distress and impending doom, reflecting the judgment pronounced by God through Isaiah. This lamentation is a response to the invasion and destruction prophesied against Moab, a nation often in conflict with Israel.<p><b>their voices are heard as far as Jahaz.</b><br>Jahaz was a location where Israel fought and defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, during their journey to the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). The mention of Jahaz indicates the extent of the outcry, suggesting widespread panic and fear. This geographical reference underscores the severity of the situation, as the cries reach far beyond the immediate vicinity, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the judgment.<p><b>Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out;</b><br>The soldiers of Moab, known for their strength and valor, are depicted as crying out in fear and despair. This reaction is significant, as it shows that even the mighty warriors are unable to withstand the coming calamity. The Moabites were historically known for their military prowess, yet here they are portrayed as vulnerable and overwhelmed, emphasizing the power of divine judgment.<p><b>their souls tremble within.</b><br>The trembling of their souls indicates profound fear and internal turmoil. This phrase captures the emotional and psychological impact of the impending disaster. It reflects a deep-seated dread that goes beyond physical defeat, touching on the spiritual and existential crisis faced by the Moabites. This trembling can be seen as a metaphor for the ultimate judgment that all nations face before God, pointing to the need for repentance and reliance on divine mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Moab, often associated with the Amorites before being conquered by the Israelites.

It must have been in the vicinity of Dibon, since Mesha, on taking it from the Israelites, annexed it to the territory of that city (Moabite Stone, II. 19-21). It was the scene of the great battle between Sihon and the Israelites under Moses (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His life shall be grievous unto him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his soul shall be grieved within him</span>.
