It reflects God's protective nature and His desire to guide and preserve His chosen ones. The term "my people" is often used throughout the Old Testament to denote Israel, God's covenant nation (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). It emphasizes the special status and responsibility of being God's people, as well as the assurance of His care and guidance.<p><b>enter your rooms</b><br>The instruction to enter rooms suggests a place of safety and refuge. In biblical times, homes were often seen as sanctuaries from external threats. This imagery can be connected to the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where the Israelites were instructed to stay inside their homes marked with lamb's blood to be spared from the plague. It symbolizes a call to seek God's protection and to trust in His provision during times of judgment or calamity.<p><b>and shut your doors behind you</b><br>Shutting the doors signifies a complete separation from the outside world and its impending dangers. It implies an act of faith and obedience, trusting that God will protect those who follow His instructions. This action can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual separation from sin and the world, aligning with New Testament teachings on being set apart for God (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>Hide yourselves a little while</b><br>The phrase suggests a temporary period of concealment and protection. It indicates that the coming wrath is not permanent and that God's people will be preserved through it. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the end times, where believers are called to endure and remain faithful until God's final deliverance (<a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a>). It also reflects the biblical theme of waiting on God's timing and trusting in His ultimate plan.<p><b>until the wrath has passed</b><br>This refers to God's judgment, which is often depicted as His wrath against sin and unrighteousness. The concept of divine wrath is prevalent throughout the Bible, emphasizing God's holiness and justice (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). The assurance that the wrath will pass highlights God's mercy and the promise of restoration for His people. It echoes the deliverance themes found in the Psalms and the prophetic books, where God's judgment is followed by renewal and hope (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name. He prophesied during a time of great turmoil and change in Israel and Judah, delivering messages of both judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often the primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies. During Isaiah's time, Judah faced threats from surrounding nations and internal spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wrath.htm">God's Wrath</a></b><br>Refers to the divine judgment and punishment that God brings upon nations or individuals due to sin and disobedience.
