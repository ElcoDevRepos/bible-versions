His inquiry reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek confirmation or assurance from God. This mirrors Gideon's request for a sign in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>, demonstrating a human desire for tangible evidence of divine promises.<p><b>&#8220;What will be the sign</b><br>In biblical times, signs were often requested as confirmation of God's promises or actions. Signs served as divine assurances, as seen with Moses and the burning bush (Exodus 3) or the rainbow after the flood (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>). Hezekiah's request for a sign is consistent with this tradition, seeking assurance of God's promise of healing and extended life.<p><b>that I will go up</b><br>The phrase "go up" is significant in biblical language, often indicating a journey to a place of worship or significance. In this context, it implies a return to normalcy and religious duty, as Hezekiah anticipates being well enough to visit the temple. This reflects the importance of the temple in Jewish worship and the king's dedication to his faith.<p><b>to the house of the LORD?&#8221;</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. It symbolizes God's presence among His people and is a focal point for religious life. Hezekiah's desire to return to the temple underscores his commitment to worship and the centrality of the temple in Jewish religious practice. This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who fell ill and was granted an extension of life by God.

<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine reversal: God answers immediately, adding fifteen years to his life and promising deliverance from Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Takeaway: The request that follows springs from a faith already rewarded&#8212;he simply wants added assurance, not because God&#8217;s word is doubtful but because the moment is weighty (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What will be the sign</b><p>&#8226; Biblical pattern: Gideon asked for a fleece (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>); Jonathan looked for a signal (<a href="/1_samuel/14-9.htm">1 Samuel 14:9-10</a>); even the disciples asked Jesus for a sign of His coming (<a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God often supplies tangible confirmation when it will strengthen genuine faith (<a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>; <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The sign granted here&#8212;turning the shadow ten steps backward (<a href="/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8-11</a>)&#8212;is a literal miracle, underscoring the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty over time itself, much as He halted the sun for Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I will go up</b><p>&#8226; Purpose of the healing: not merely extended life, but restored ability to ascend the temple mount.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Go up&#8221; echoes the pilgrim songs of ascent (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s first ambition after recovery is worship, not political gain.<p>&#8226; Application: God&#8217;s gifts are meant to propel us toward deeper fellowship and service, never mere self-preservation (<a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the house of the LORD?</b><p>&#8226; Centrality of the temple: the chosen place where God set His Name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41-43</a>).<p>&#8226; For a king responsible for temple reform (<a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29&#8211;31</a>), returning there would publicly display God&#8217;s mercy and reinforce national faith.<p>&#8226; The question highlights a heart aligned with <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>&#8212;desiring God&#8217;s presence above all.<p>&#8226; Significance: when the shadow retreated, every onlooker knew the covenant God still ruled Jerusalem, securing both the king&#8217;s life and the city&#8217;s future (<a href="/isaiah/37-35.htm">Isaiah 37:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a> shows a faithful king seeking a concrete pledge that his promised healing will culminate in renewed worship. God answers with a literal, cosmic sign, affirming His word and directing Hezekiah&#8212;and all who witness or read the account&#8212;back to the temple, the place of communion and praise. The verse reminds us that when God restores, He restores for relationship, and He is willing to bolster sincere faith with unmistakable evidence of His power and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah also had said</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Hezekiah said.</span> Our translators, both in this verse and at the commencement of ver. 21, have endeavoured to conceal the awkwardness of the <span class="accented">nexus</span>, or rather want of <span class="accented">nexus</span>, with what precedes, by a modification of the rendering.
