It is likely a small village or settlement near Jerusalem. The mention of Madmenah fleeing indicates the fear and panic spreading among the inhabitants due to the advancing Assyrian army. This reflects the historical context of the Assyrian campaigns under King Sennacherib, who threatened the southern kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Hezekiah. The flight of Madmenah's inhabitants symbolizes the broader fear and chaos experienced by the people of Judah as they faced a formidable enemy. This phrase highlights the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in earlier chapters of Isaiah.<p><b>the people of Gebim take refuge.</b><br>Gebim is another location mentioned in the context of the Assyrian threat. Like Madmenah, it is likely a small settlement near Jerusalem. The people of Gebim seeking refuge suggests a desperate attempt to find safety from the impending danger posed by the Assyrian forces. This action underscores the urgency and seriousness of the situation, as the inhabitants seek protection from the overwhelming military power of Assyria. The historical context of this event is crucial, as it demonstrates the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecies regarding the judgment and deliverance of Judah. The mention of taking refuge can also be seen as a metaphor for seeking divine protection, a theme prevalent throughout the book of Isaiah, where God is portrayed as a refuge and strength for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/madmenah.htm">Madmenah</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the context of the Assyrian invasion.

This sequence reads like a live news report, underscoring the literal threat (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The rapid flight fulfills God&#8217;s earlier warning that &#8220;the whole land is full of terror&#8221; when He wields Assyria as &#8220;the rod of My anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even as Assyria advances, the Lord sets boundaries: &#8220;He will not enter this city&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>). Madmenah&#8217;s panic does not cancel God&#8217;s promise to preserve Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; Cross-references echo the same pattern: in <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-17</a> Sennacherib overruns Judah&#8217;s towns, but <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a> reminds the remnant, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people of Gebim take refuge</b><p>&#8220;The people of Gebim take refuge&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a>) shows inhabitants hiding rather than fleeing.<p>&#8226; Gebim&#8217;s name means &#8220;cisterns,&#8221; suggesting scarce resources. Isaiah paints them scrambling for cover, perhaps in the dry gullies around their village, illustrating the helplessness of human defenses (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their decision to dig in contrasts with Madmenah&#8217;s flight, yet both responses expose the same fear. Safety ultimately rests not in strategy but in the Lord who says, &#8220;In repentance and rest is your salvation&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God will soon turn the tide: &#8220;The Lord of Hosts will lop off the boughs with terrifying power&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>), cutting down Assyria like a forest. <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a> records the literal fulfillment when the angel of the Lord strikes down 185,000 soldiers, proving His sovereignty and care for His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a> captures the panic of two tiny Judean villages as the Assyrian juggernaut closes in. Madmenah runs; Gebim hides. Both highlight the immediate, literal threat and set the stage for God&#8217;s dramatic deliverance of Jerusalem. The verse warns against trusting human solutions while urging confident rest in the Lord who keeps His promises and defeats every enemy in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Madmenah...Gebim</span>.
