Tarshish is often associated with the western extremities of the known world, possibly modern-day Spain. The directive to "cross over" implies a significant journey, indicating the severity of the situation in Tyre. Historically, Tyre was a major Phoenician port city, and its merchants would have been familiar with long sea voyages. The call to go to Tarshish may symbolize seeking refuge or continuing trade elsewhere due to impending disaster. This reflects the broader biblical theme of judgment and exile, as seen in other prophetic books.<p><b>wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!</b><br>The call to "wail" is a common prophetic expression of lamentation and mourning in response to divine judgment. The "inhabitants of the coastland" refers to the people living in the coastal regions, particularly those associated with Tyre and its surrounding areas. These coastal inhabitants were heavily reliant on maritime trade, and the fall of Tyre would have had devastating economic and social impacts. The imagery of wailing underscores the depth of loss and despair. This lamentation is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where the downfall of cities and nations leads to widespread mourning. The call to wail also serves as a warning to heed the consequences of pride and reliance on wealth, themes prevalent throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tarshish.htm">Tarshish</a></b><br>A distant port city, often associated with wealth and trade.

The Tyrians are told to go to Tarshish, the extreme point of their commerce; not, as before, to bring back their wealth, but to seek safety there as exiles. No nearer asylum would give them safety. So, in the siege of Tyre by Alexander the Great, the Tyrians sent their old men, women, and children to Carthage (Diod. Sic. xvii. 41). So Layard (<span class= "ital">Nineveh, </span>plate 71) represents enemies of the Assyrians taking refuge in ships (Cheyne). The "isle" or "coast" is, as before, Tyre, and. its neighbourhoods.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye over to Tarshish</span>. The advice was good, and may, perhaps, have been followed to some extent. When Sennacherib attacked Elulaeus of Sidon ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), that monarch fled across the sea ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 35), probably to Cyprus. When Alexander finally ruined Tyre, a part of the population made its escape on shipboard to Carthage (Arrian,' Exp. Alex.,' 2:24, &sect; 8). An escape of the kind is represented in the Assyrian sculptures (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 7l). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/23-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Cross over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;i&#7687;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Tarshish;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tar&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8659.htm">Strong's 8659: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tarshish -- a son of Javan, also a port on the Mediterranean, also a Benjamite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wail,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3213.htm">Strong's 3213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To howl, make a howling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O inhabitants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the coastland!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_339.htm">Strong's 339: </a> </span><span class="str2">A habitable spot, dry land, a coast, an island</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/23-6.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 23:6 Pass over to Tarshish!
