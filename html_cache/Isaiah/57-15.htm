The imagery of being "high and lifted up" is reminiscent of Isaiah's vision in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where he sees the Lord seated on a high and exalted throne. This highlights God's transcendence and majesty, setting Him apart from all creation. It also foreshadows the exaltation of Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a> as being highly exalted by God.<p><b>who inhabits eternity</b><br>God's eternal nature is underscored here, indicating that He exists beyond time and space. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God being from everlasting to everlasting. It reassures believers of God's unchanging nature and eternal presence, providing a foundation for trust and faith.<p><b>whose name is Holy</b><br>The holiness of God is a central theme in Scripture, signifying His purity, righteousness, and separateness from sin. In <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>, God calls His people to be holy as He is holy, reflecting His character. The name "Holy" signifies God's unique and perfect nature, which is worthy of reverence and worship.<p><b>I dwell in a high and holy place</b><br>This phrase indicates God's dwelling in heaven, a place of purity and perfection. It reflects the biblical understanding of heaven as God's throne, as seen in <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>. The high and holy place signifies God's separation from sin and His position of authority over the universe.<p><b>and with the oppressed and humble in spirit</b><br>Despite His exalted position, God is intimately concerned with the lowly and humble. This reflects the biblical theme of God's care for the marginalized and oppressed, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>, where God is near to the brokenhearted. It also prefigures the ministry of Jesus, who associated with the humble and downtrodden, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p><b>to restore the spirit of the lowly</b><br>God's purpose is to bring restoration and healing to those who are humble and contrite. This aligns with the message of hope and redemption found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, where God heals the brokenhearted. It emphasizes God's desire to lift up those who are spiritually low.<p><b>and revive the heart of the contrite</b><br>Revival and renewal are central to God's work in the lives of believers. The contrite heart, one that is repentant and sorrowful for sin, is met with God's grace and forgiveness. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, where a broken and contrite heart is described as pleasing to God.

When we approach Him in humility, we discover that the God who is infinitely high is also infinitely close, eager to restore and revive us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">For thus saith the high and lofty . . .</span>--The central truth for the comfort of God's people is that the infinitely Great One cares even for the infinitely little. The truth of the greatness of lowliness manifested in the life of Christ was but the reflection of the permanent law of the Divine government. The "high and holy place" is, of course, the heavenly temple, the "light inaccessible." The verse, as a whole, combines the truths of <a href="/2_chronicles/6-18.htm" title="But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!">2Chronicles 6:18</a>, and <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm" title="The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.">Psalm 51:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-21.</span> - A PROMISE OF SALVATION TO THE HUMBLE AND PENITENT, WITH A FURTHER THREAT AGAINST THE WICKED. The prophet, in this portion of his discourse, whereof "comfort" is the key-note (<a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>), can never continue threatening long without relapsing into a tone of tenderness and pity. He now sets against his long denunciation (in vers. 3-12) an ample promise (vers. 15-19), and against his brief encouragement (in vers. 13, 14) a short menace (vers. 20, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The ground of the promise of salvation in ver. 15 is God's combined might and mercy, which are now set forth. <span class="cmt_word">The high and lofty One</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where the same words are translated "high and lifted up"). In God's loftiness are included at once his exalted majesty and his almighty power. He is "high" in himself, transcending thought, and "lofty" or "lifted up" in that he is absolute Lord of his creatures, and therefore high above them. <span class="cmt_word">That inhabiteth eternity</span>. So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> But the Hebrew is less abstract, and would perhaps be best translated "that liveth eternally." <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the high and holy place</span>. Solomon's "heaven of heavens" (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), which, however, "cannot contain him;" St. Paul's "light which no man can approach unto" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); Zechariah's "holy habitation" (<a href="/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). With him also that is of a contrite - literally, <span class="accented">crushed -</span> and humble spirit. "Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly "(<a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>); "He humbleth himself to consider the things that are in heaven and earth" (<a href="/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>). He is not an Epicurean Deity, too far exalted above man to have any regard for him, or concern himself with man's welfare (see <a href="/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12, 13</a>). On the contrary, he condescends to "dwell with" man, only let man have a "humble" and "crushed," or "bruised," spirit. <span class="cmt_word">To revive the spirit of the humble</span>. When God condescends to visit the contrite and humble spirit, the immediate effect is to comfort, console, revive.
