The term "house of Jacob" is often used to refer to the entire nation of Israel, highlighting their shared ancestry and covenant relationship with God. This call to listen is a common prophetic device, urging the people to heed God's words, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."<p><b>all the remnant of the house of Israel</b><br>The "remnant" refers to the portion of Israel that remains faithful or survives after judgment or calamity. This concept is significant throughout the prophetic books, where God promises to preserve a faithful group despite widespread unfaithfulness. The idea of a remnant is also seen in <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, where Paul speaks of a remnant chosen by grace, indicating God's ongoing plan for His people.<p><b>who have been sustained from the womb</b><br>This phrase underscores God's providential care and faithfulness from the very beginning of Israel's existence. The imagery of being sustained from the womb suggests a nurturing, parental relationship, similar to God's care for individuals like Jeremiah, who was known by God before birth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). It highlights God's intimate involvement in the life of His people.<p><b>carried along since birth</b><br>The metaphor of being "carried" suggests protection and guidance, akin to a parent carrying a child. This imagery is consistent with God's actions throughout Israel's history, such as leading them out of Egypt and through the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who carries the burdens of humanity (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), fulfilling the ultimate role of the divine shepherd and caretaker.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_jacob.htm">House of Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel.
