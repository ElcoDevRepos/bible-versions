Historically, the Israelites entered the land under Joshua's leadership, and the temple was later established by Solomon. However, due to disobedience and idolatry, their hold on the land and the temple was often disrupted. This temporary possession can be seen as a consequence of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The "holy place" refers to the temple, a central symbol of God's presence among His people. The brevity of their possession underscores the recurring theme of exile and return throughout Israel's history.<p><b>but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the desecration and destruction of the temple by foreign powers, a significant event in Israel's history. The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, destroyed Solomon's Temple in 586 BC, an event that marked a profound spiritual and national crisis for the Jewish people. The trampling of the sanctuary symbolizes not only physical destruction but also spiritual defilement. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as Lamentations and Ezekiel, where the destruction of the temple is lamented. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the vulnerability of sacred spaces when God's protection is withdrawn. The trampling also foreshadows future desecrations, including those mentioned in Daniel's prophecies and the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the destruction of the temple (<a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_people.htm">God's People (Israelites)</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Promised Land and the temple as a place of worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_place/sanctuary.htm">Holy Place/Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where God's presence dwelled among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The foreign nations and powers that invaded and desecrated the temple, often seen as instruments of God's judgment due to Israel's disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment and offering hope for future restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical event where the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and took many Israelites into captivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The desecration of the temple serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

<a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-43</a>).<p>&#8226; God had granted the nation moments of rest&#8212;under Joshua, David, Solomon&#8212;yet they were temporary because disobedience cut them short (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underlines God&#8217;s patience: though sin swiftly forfeits blessing, He still allows even a &#8220;short while&#8221; of possession so His promises remain visible (<a href="/nehemiah/9-31.htm">Nehemiah 9:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This brevity heightens the lament: &#8220;Lord, we tasted Your goodness, but our unfaithfulness made it fleeting.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your people possessed Your holy place</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Your people&#8221;

The statement is factual and literal: there was a period when the people truly occupied God&#8217;s sanctuary, offering daily worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-2.htm">2 Chronicles 31:2, 20</a>-21).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary</b><p>&#8226;

Compared with that promise, the period of possession, from Joshua and David to the fall of the monarchy, was but as a "little while." (Comp. <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>.)
