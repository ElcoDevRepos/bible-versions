The Assyrians were known for their psychological warfare, aiming to sow doubt and fear among their enemies. Hezekiah, the king of Judah, was a reformer who trusted in the LORD, and the Assyrian official sought to undermine that trust. This reflects the broader biblical theme of faith versus fear, as seen in other instances where leaders are challenged to trust God despite overwhelming odds (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><b>when he says, &#8216;The LORD will deliver us.&#8217;</b><br>Hezekiah's faith in the LORD's deliverance is a central theme in the narrative. The Assyrian official's challenge is not just against Hezekiah but against the power and faithfulness of the God of Israel. This echoes earlier biblical accounts where God's deliverance is promised and fulfilled, such as the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the eventual miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem, as recorded later in <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>.<p><b>Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land</b><br>The Assyrian official's rhetorical question is designed to instill doubt by pointing to the apparent success of Assyria over other nations and their gods. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the power of national deities, where military success was often attributed to the superiority of one nation's god over another's. However, the biblical narrative consistently emphasizes that the LORD is not like other gods, being the one true God with sovereign power over all nations (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>).<p><b>from the hand of the king of Assyria?</b><br>The Assyrian Empire, under kings like Sennacherib, was a dominant military power in the ancient Near East, known for its conquests and brutal tactics. The phrase highlights the historical context of Assyrian expansion and the fear it instilled in surrounding nations. However, the biblical account ultimately demonstrates that the power of earthly kings is limited and subject to the will of God, as seen in the eventual defeat of the Assyrian army (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>).

His opening line is a warning against their own king. It is a classic tactic of the enemy&#8212;undermine the leader who is pointing people to trust God. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-10.htm">2 Chronicles 32:10-12</a> shows the same speech, underscoring how seriously the Assyrians took psychological warfare. Jesus later cautions, &#8220;See that no one deceives you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4</a>), reminding us that voices challenging our faith are not confined to ancient walls. Paul writes in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a> about standing against the devil&#8217;s schemes, echoing the need to recognize deception and hold the line.<p>Bullet points for today&#8217;s walk:<p>&#8226; Expect challenges to spiritual leadership that calls for faith.<p>&#8226; Test every message against God&#8217;s word, not against the intimidation of circumstance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he says, &#8216;The LORD will deliver us.&#8217;</b><p>The Rabshakeh ridicules Hezekiah&#8217;s confidence in the covenant-keeping God. Yet Hezekiah&#8217;s assurance came straight from promises like <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble,&#8221; and from prophetic words already spoken by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6-7</a>). Deliverance was not wishful thinking but rooted in God&#8217;s unchanging character (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-6.htm">2 Kings 19:6-7</a>). The taunt therefore attacks the very heart of biblical faith: trusting God to act in real history.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Faith rests on revealed truth, not on visible odds.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past acts of rescue (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>) fuel present confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land</b><p>Now the field commander broadens his argument: no other nation&#8217;s deity has halted Assyria, so why think Judah&#8217;s God will? This lumps the LORD in with idols of wood and stone (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). Yet Scripture insists, &#8220;The LORD is the true God; He is the living God&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10-11</a>). The challenge unintentionally spotlights the uniqueness of Israel&#8217;s God&#8212;He alone is Creator, not created.<p>Points to remember:<p>&#8226; False gods are powerless; the living God acts (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The world&#8217;s track record with idols cannot measure God&#8217;s capability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the hand of the king of Assyria?</b><p>Assyria&#8217;s empire seemed unstoppable; cities from Hamath to Samaria had fallen (<a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>). The rhetorical question carries an unspoken boast: &#8220;Our king is invincible.&#8221; Yet Isaiah had already prophesied Assyria&#8217;s downfall once its purpose as God&#8217;s instrument was complete (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12-19</a>). Within a short time God would send His angel, and 185,000 Assyrian soldiers would lie dead (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>). <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a> declares God laughs at arrogant rulers; <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a> affirms He does as He pleases with the armies of heaven and the peoples of earth.<p>Encouragement for us:<p>&#8226; Earthly power, however intimidating, is subject to God&#8217;s sovereign limit.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s deliverance may come at the eleventh hour, but it is never late.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a> records the enemy&#8217;s attempt to erode faith by mocking Hezekiah&#8217;s trust in God, equating the LORD with impotent idols, and exalting Assyria&#8217;s might. The verse reminds us that deception often appears logical when it measures God by human standards. Yet the living God stands incomparable, faithful to His word, and sovereign over every empire. When circumstances taunt, &#8220;Has anyone ever been rescued from this?&#8221;, Scripture answers, &#8220;The LORD rescues His people&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).

Sennacherib claims to be entitled to the people's allegiance, and represents Hezekiah as a rebel, who seeks to draw them away from their duty. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land? The successes of the Assyrians, and the religious character of their wars, justified this boast. The pervading idea of the inscriptions is that wars arc undertaken for the glory of the Assyrian deities, particularly of Asshur, for the chastisement of his enemies, and with the object of establishing in each country, as it is brought under subjection, the laws and worship of Asshur (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 322-324 and 531). The nations fight under the protection of their own gods, and thus each war is a struggle between the Assyrian deities and those of the nation with which they arc contending. Hitherto, undoubtedly, Assyria had met with almost uniform success (see <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/36-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not let</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pen-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6435.htm">Strong's 6435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Removal, lest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mislead</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(yas&#183;s&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5496.htm">Strong's 5496: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prick, stimulate, to seduce</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you when he says,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
