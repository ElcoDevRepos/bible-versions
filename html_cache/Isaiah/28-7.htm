The use of "stagger" and "stumble" metaphorically represents their inability to lead effectively due to intoxication. In the ancient Near East, wine was a common part of daily life, but excessive consumption was condemned (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The leaders' drunkenness symbolizes their lack of spiritual discernment and failure to uphold God's law.<p><b>Priests and prophets reel from strong drink and are befuddled by wine:</b><br>Priests and prophets were expected to be spiritual guides and mediators between God and the people. Their intoxication signifies a corruption of their sacred roles. <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a> explicitly warns priests against drinking wine when entering the tent of meeting, emphasizing the need for sobriety in spiritual matters. The prophets, who were supposed to convey God's messages, are depicted as confused and ineffective, failing in their divine mission.<p><b>They stumble because of strong drink, muddled in their visions and stumbling in their judgments:</b><br>The repetition of "stumble" underscores the severity of their impairment. Visions and judgments were crucial for guiding the nation according to God's will. The leaders' inability to see clearly or make sound decisions due to drunkenness reflects a broader spiritual blindness and moral failure.

He has painted the drunkards of Ephraim; now he turns and paints in yet darker colours the drunkards of Judah. Priests were seen reeling to their services, prophets reeling in the very act of their counterfeit inspiration. The threefold iteration of the word for "reel" emphasises the scandals of the scene.

Prophets might have been expected to act in the spirit of the command given to priests.
