The mention of "going up" suggests a pilgrimage or a ritualistic ascent to a place of worship, indicating the city's religious practices. The "temple" and "high places" refer to locations where the Moabites worshiped their gods, such as Chemosh. This act of weeping signifies mourning and desperation, likely due to impending judgment or calamity. The high places were often associated with idolatry, which was condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>).<p><b>Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba.</b><br>Nebo and Medeba were prominent locations in Moab. Nebo is known for its association with Mount Nebo, where Moses viewed the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/34.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). Medeba was a city on the plateau east of the Jordan River. The wailing over these locations indicates widespread distress and lamentation throughout Moab. This mourning reflects the cultural practice of expressing grief through loud cries and public displays, often seen in the ancient Near East (<a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>).<p><b>Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.</b><br>Shaving the head and cutting off the beard were traditional signs of mourning and humiliation in the ancient Near East. These acts symbolized deep sorrow and were often performed in response to national disaster or personal loss (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). In the context of Moab, this imagery underscores the severity of the judgment they faced. The shaving of the head and beard also signifies a loss of identity and dignity, as hair was considered a symbol of honor and strength (<a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dibon.htm">Dibon</a></b><br>A city in Moab, known for its high places and temples.

Instead of joyful sacrifice, they now bring tears.<p>&#8226; High places were built in defiance of God&#8217;s command that worship be centered on His chosen altar (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). By returning there under distress, Moab looks to powerless idols rather than to the LORD who alone controls nations.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah echoes this coming judgment: &#8220;Come down from your glory, O Daughter who dwells in Dibon&#8230; Moab&#8217;s destroyer has come against you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The people &#8220;go up&#8221; geographically, but spiritually they are bankrupt. <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a> already hinted at Dibon&#8217;s vulnerability; Isaiah now announces its fulfillment.<p>&#8226; Their weeping confirms God&#8217;s word that idols cannot save (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9&#8211;20</a>). The literal tears on those heights dramatize the emptiness of false worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba</b><p>The lament spreads from Dibon to two more Moabite centers, showing that no town is spared.<p>&#8226; Nebo&#8212;named after a pagan deity&#8212;was once included in Israel&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>). Its loss shows Moab&#8217;s collapse and the reversal of old border victories. Jeremiah repeats the warning: &#8220;Woe to Nebo, for it is devastated&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Medeba lay on a strategic plain; Isaiah&#8217;s mention underlines that economic advantages cannot shield from divine judgment (compare <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a> where Ar and Kir are struck).<p>&#8226; The single word &#8220;wails&#8221; conveys continual, loud grief. Like Egypt in <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>, the whole land cries out under God&#8217;s hand.<p>&#8226; By naming multiple sites, the verse affirms a literal, nationwide calamity&#8212;not mere symbolism&#8212;showing that every promise of God&#8217;s prophets comes to pass exactly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off</b><p>Personal appearance becomes an outward sign of inward despair.<p>&#8226; Shaving the head was a public act of mourning (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). Micah commands similar action when judgment draws near (<a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah describes the same scene among Moab: &#8220;For every head is shaved and every beard clipped&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>). Isaiah and Jeremiah therefore corroborate one another, underscoring the certainty of the event.<p>&#8226; For Israelite men, beards symbolized dignity; cutting them off represented humiliation (<a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4&#8211;5</a>). Moab experiences that shame because of persistent pride (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a> foretells national grief expressed by baldness. <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> shows the prophecy lived out in real time&#8212;mourning so intense that cultural norms are abandoned.<p>&#8226; The detail highlights how sin ultimately strips away honor and identity, a timeless lesson that rebellion brings ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of Moab&#8217;s downfall: idol worshippers climbing their own high places in tears, the cry spreading from city to city, and even personal appearance testifying to grief. The Holy Spirit records each place name and mourning custom to show that God&#8217;s warnings are precise and unfailing.

This place is situated in the country east of the Dead Sea, about three miles north of the river Arnon, on the old Roman road connecting Rabbath-Moab with Hesh-bob. The town seems to have gained in importance from the fact that it was the birthplace of Chemosh-Gad, Mesha's father (Moabite Stone, 1. 2). Mesha added to its territory (ibid., 1.21). It is extremely probable that it was the site of one of the Moabite "high places," and was therefore naturally one of the places whereto the Moabites, when afflicted, went up" to weep." <span class="cmt_word">Over Nebo, and over Medeba</span>. Nebe and Medeba were also ancient Moabite towns. Nebo is mentioned in <a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 38</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1, 22</a>. It seems to have lain almost midway between Beth-baal-meon (Main) and Medeba, about three or four miles south-east of Heshbon. Medeba obtains notice in <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>. Mesha says that it was taken from the Moabites by Omri, King of Israel, but recovered by himself at the end of forty 'years (Moabite Stone, 11. 7-9). It lay south-east of Hesh-ben, at the spot which still retains the old name <span class="accented">- Madeba</span>. It has been suggested that there was at Nebo a shrine of the Baby-Ionian god so named; but this is to assume a resemblance which the facts at present known do not indicate, between the Moabite and Babylonian religions. <span class="cmt_word">On all their heads shall be baldness</span>. The practice of cutting off the hair in mourning was common to the Jews (<a href="/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>) with various other nations; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the Persians (Herod., 9:24), the Greeks, the Macedonians (Pint., 'Vit. Pelop.,' &sect; 34), the primitive Arabs (Krehl, 'Religion der voris-lamit. Araber,' p. 33, note 1), and the North American Indians (Bancroft,' Native Races of America'). It was probably intended, like lacerations, and ashes on the head, as a mere disfigurement, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/15-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Dibon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1465;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
