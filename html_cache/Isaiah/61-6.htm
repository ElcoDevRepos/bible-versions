In the Old Testament, the priesthood was limited to the tribe of Levi, specifically the descendants of Aaron. However, this prophecy extends the priestly role to a broader group, indicating a future where God's people collectively serve as priests. This aligns with the New Testament concept found in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are described as a "royal priesthood." The role of a priest involves mediating between God and people, offering sacrifices, and teaching the law, which suggests a future where God's people are deeply involved in spiritual leadership and service.<p><b>they will speak of you as ministers of our God;</b><br>The term "ministers" here implies service and dedication to God's work. In the historical context, ministers were those who served in the temple, assisting the priests. This phrase suggests a recognition by others of the spiritual authority and service of God's people. It reflects a future where the people of God are acknowledged for their devotion and service to Him, fulfilling roles that were once exclusive to a select few. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant, where all believers have direct access to God and are called to serve Him.<p><b>you will feed on the wealth of nations,</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes and a blessing of abundance. Historically, Israel often faced oppression and exploitation by surrounding nations. The promise here is one of restoration and provision, where the wealth of the nations will be brought to God's people. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to bless those who bless Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also points to a future time of prosperity and peace, possibly in the Messianic age, where God's people will experience material and spiritual abundance.<p><b>and you will boast in their riches.</b><br>Boasting in the riches of the nations suggests a time when God's people will have reason to celebrate and take pride in the blessings they receive. This is not a prideful boasting but a recognition of God's provision and faithfulness. It reflects a future where the wealth and resources of the world are used for God's glory and the benefit of His people. This can be connected to the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, where the nations bring their glory and honor into the New Jerusalem, symbolizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_of_the_lord.htm">Priests of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to those who are set apart to serve God, traditionally from the tribe of Levi in the Old Testament, but here it signifies a broader calling for God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/ministers_of_our_god.htm">Ministers of our God</a></b><br>Indicates a role of service and representation of God to others, emphasizing a spiritual leadership and responsibility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth_of_nations.htm">Wealth of Nations</a></b><br>Symbolizes the resources and blessings that will be available to God's people, indicating a reversal of fortunes and divine provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered this message, speaking to the people of Israel during a time of expectation for future restoration and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of this prophecy, who were looking forward to a time of redemption and restoration after periods of exile and hardship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_identity_in_christ.htm">Priestly Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to embrace our identity as priests, serving God and representing Him to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/service_as_ministers.htm">Service as Ministers</a></b><br>Our role as ministers involves active service and dedication to God's purposes, impacting those around us with His love and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision_and_blessing.htm">Divine Provision and Blessing</a></b><br>Trust in God's provision, knowing that He will supply our needs and enable us to thrive spiritually and materially.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_nations.htm">Witness to the Nations</a></b><br>Our lives should be a testimony to others, drawing them to the richness of life in Christ and the blessings of His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_leadership.htm">Spiritual Leadership</a></b><br>Embrace the responsibility of spiritual leadership, guiding others in their faith journey and fostering a community centered on God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_61_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 61:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_be_daily_priests_of_the_LORD.htm">How can we serve as "priests of the LORD" in our daily lives?
