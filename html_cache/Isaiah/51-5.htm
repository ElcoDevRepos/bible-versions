In the context of Isaiah, righteousness often refers to God's faithfulness to His covenant and His moral perfection. The nearness of God's righteousness implies that His promises are about to be fulfilled. This can be connected to the messianic prophecies, where the coming of the Messiah is seen as the ultimate expression of God's righteousness. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often identified as the embodiment of God's righteousness (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-22</a>).<p><b>My salvation is on the way</b><br>Here, salvation is portrayed as an active force approaching humanity. In the historical context, this would have been a message of hope to the Israelites, who were often in distress due to exile or oppression. Salvation in the Old Testament frequently involves deliverance from physical or political enemies, but it also has spiritual dimensions. This phrase foreshadows the New Testament understanding of salvation through Jesus Christ, who brings deliverance from sin and eternal death (<a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>).<p><b>and My arms will bring justice to the nations</b><br>The "arms" of God symbolize His power and might. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the arm was a symbol of strength and authority. This phrase suggests that God's power will establish justice not just for Israel, but for all nations. This universal scope is a recurring theme in Isaiah, pointing to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan. The fulfillment of this prophecy is seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the spread of the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>The islands will look for Me</b><br>The mention of "islands" indicates distant lands, emphasizing the global reach of God's salvation. In the ancient world, islands were often seen as remote and isolated, representing the farthest reaches of the known world. This phrase suggests that even those in the most distant places will seek God. It aligns with the prophetic vision of all nations turning to the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>) and is echoed in the New Testament with the spread of Christianity beyond the Jewish world (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>and wait in hope for My arm</b><br>Waiting in hope implies a confident expectation of God's intervention. This reflects a theme of trust and patience in God's timing, which is prevalent throughout the Bible. The "arm" of God, as previously noted, represents His power and ability to save. This hope is not passive but is rooted in faith in God's promises. In the New Testament, believers are encouraged to wait for the return of Christ with similar hope and expectation (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and. a thousand years as one day" (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). Isaiah always speaks as if the Messianic kingdom was to supervene almost immediately on the return of the exiles to Palestine. It was not revealed to him that there would be an interval of from five hundred to six hundred years between the two events. By God's "<span class="accented">righteousness"</span> here we must understand his righteous plans for the redemption of his people through Christ, and for the punishment of those who resist his will and remain impenitent.
