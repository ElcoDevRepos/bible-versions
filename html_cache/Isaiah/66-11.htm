In the context of <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66</a>, Jerusalem is often personified as a mother, and the people of God are her children. This reflects the intimate relationship between God and His people, where He provides for their needs and offers comfort. The idea of nursing and satisfaction suggests a deep, fulfilling relationship with God, where spiritual needs are met. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe God&#8217;s nurturing nature, such as <a href="/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a>, where the psalmist compares his soul to a weaned child with its mother. The comforting breasts symbolize the sustenance and peace found in God's presence, echoing the promise of spiritual fulfillment and contentment.<p><b>you may drink deeply and delight yourselves in her glorious abundance.</b><br>The phrase "drink deeply" implies an invitation to fully partake in the blessings and prosperity that God provides. This abundance is not just material but also spiritual, reflecting the richness of life in communion with God. The term "glorious abundance" suggests a superlative state of blessing, reminiscent of the promises of restoration and prosperity found throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, where the wealth of nations is brought to Jerusalem. This abundance can also be seen as a type of the eternal blessings found in Christ, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>) and promises life in abundance (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The delight in this abundance points to the joy and satisfaction that come from a relationship with God, fulfilling the deepest desires of the human heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry was primarily to the Kingdom of Judah.

God pledges abundance that quiets every hunger (<a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>).<p>- The &#8220;comforting breasts&#8221; underline tenderness. Jerusalem&#8212;ultimately the place where God dwells with His people&#8212;becomes the center of consolation (<a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- When the exiles returned from Babylon they tasted a measure of this promise, but the prophecy reaches its peak when Messiah reigns and every believer finds complete rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You may drink deeply</b><p>- The verb pictures long, unhurried draughts of blessing. No rationing is needed; the supply is limitless (<a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>- Jesus echoes this invitation: &#8220;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>). He is the living water who channels Zion&#8217;s bounty to every heart.<p>- Deep drinking means personal appropriation. We do not merely observe God&#8217;s goodness; we internalize it until it becomes part of us (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And delight yourselves in her glorious abundance</b><p>- Delight is active joy, the spontaneous response to God&#8217;s overflowing gifts (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>).<p>- &#8220;Glorious abundance&#8221; points to both material prosperity restored to the land (<a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5&#8211;7</a>) and the radiant presence of God Himself (<a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>).<p>- The climax is worship. As Zion flourishes, the nations stream in with praise (<a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18&#8211;20</a>), and God&#8217;s people exult in the splendor that reflects His own glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/66-11.htm">Isaiah 66:11</a> assures God&#8217;s children of nurturing care, complete satisfaction, inexhaustible provision, and joyful abundance flowing from Jerusalem&#8212;ultimately from the Lord who dwells there. The verse looks ahead to the full restoration in Christ&#8217;s kingdom, while offering every believer present comfort and delight in God&#8217;s unfailing provision today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">That ye may suck . . .</span>--The figure takes a new and bolder form.
