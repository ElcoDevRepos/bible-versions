In the context of <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, God is executing judgment on the nations, particularly Edom, and assigning the land to creatures of desolation. The concept of God allotting portions is reminiscent of the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel in the book of Joshua (Joshua 13-21). It underscores the belief that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, determining the fate of nations and peoples.<p><b>His hand has distributed it by measure.</b><br>The imagery of God's hand distributing by measure suggests precision and intentionality in His actions. This reflects the biblical theme of God's meticulous care and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-5</a>, where God measures the earth. The use of "measure" implies that God's judgments are not arbitrary but are carefully weighed and executed according to His perfect wisdom and justice.<p><b>They will possess it forever;</b><br>The phrase "possess it forever" speaks to the permanence of God's decrees. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, it refers to the desolation of Edom, which will be inhabited by wild animals and unclean creatures as a perpetual sign of judgment. This contrasts with the eternal inheritance promised to God's people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>, where the righteous are promised to inherit the land forever. It highlights the enduring nature of God's promises and judgments.<p><b>they will dwell in it from generation to generation.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the lasting impact of God's judgment. The desolation of Edom is not temporary but will continue through successive generations, serving as a testament to God's power and justice. In a broader biblical context, the idea of dwelling from generation to generation is often associated with the blessings of covenant faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, where God keeps His covenant to a thousand generations. Here, however, it underscores the irrevocable nature of divine judgment on those who oppose God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign ruler who determines the fate of nations and peoples.

By the time we reach verse 17, the prophet pictures God carving up that once-proud territory for owls, jackals, and other unclean animals (vv. 11&#8211;15).<p>&#8226; The takeaway is plain: no nation can cling to land or power once God reassigns it (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His hand has distributed it by measure</b><p>&#8220; His hand has distributed it by measure &#8221; assures us that the allotment is neither random nor careless.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a> asks, &#8220;Who fixed its measurements&#8212;surely you know!&#8221; The same divine precision that laid earth&#8217;s foundations now doles out Edom&#8217;s ruins by exact &#8220;measure.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a> pictures God &#8220;measuring the waters in the hollow of His hand,&#8221; underscoring meticulous control. Judgments are not emotional outbursts but carefully calibrated to fit the crime (<a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; does the measuring, the decision is irreversible; no human treaty or alliance can redraw the map He has finalized (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will possess it forever</b><p>&#8220; They will possess it forever &#8221; shifts focus to duration.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;they&#8221; refers to the scavenging creatures listed in verses 11-15. God is granting them permanent title to Edom&#8217;s land, just as He once gave Israel the Promised Land (<a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forever&#8221; means the devastation will not be quickly repaired; Edom&#8217;s prideful cities will remain a haunt of beasts (<a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The same word &#8220;forever&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s covenant blessings (<a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>). If His promises of mercy are eternal, so are His decrees of judgment&#8212;both flow from the same faithful character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will dwell in it from generation to generation</b><p>The closing phrase nails down the idea of continuous occupancy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27-28</a> celebrates the LORD who remains &#8220;the same,&#8221; and &#8220;the children of Your servants will dwell securely.&#8221; Here, however, the principle is applied in reverse: unclean animals will inherit Edom &#8220;from generation to generation,&#8221; confirming total and lasting desolation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a> uses the same expression of God&#8217;s memorial name &#8220;throughout all generations,&#8221; stressing that His word endures longer than any kingdom or dynasty.<p>&#8226; The line also implies a warning: if God can perpetuate judgment through successive generations, there is no safe harbor in merely &#8220;waiting out&#8221; His anger (<a href="/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19</a>). Only repentance can alter the future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/34-17.htm">Isaiah 34:17</a> caps a chapter of stark judgment by highlighting four realities: God alone decides territorial destinies, He does so with deliberate precision, His verdicts stand forever, and they are upheld across generations.
