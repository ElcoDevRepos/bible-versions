It emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the message. In the context of Isaiah, God often communicates directly with His prophets to guide, warn, or comfort His people. This underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages that are not their own but from the Almighty.<p><b>Like a lion roaring or a young lion over its prey&#8212;</b><br>The imagery of a lion is powerful and conveys strength, dominance, and fearlessness. In the ancient Near East, lions were symbols of power and were often associated with royalty and divinity. This metaphor suggests God's might and His protective nature over His people. The lion's roar signifies authority and the certainty of its actions, much like God's assured intervention.<p><b>and though a band of shepherds is called out against it,</b><br>Shepherds in biblical times were protectors of their flocks, often facing threats from predators like lions. This phrase suggests a collective human effort to confront a powerful force. It highlights the futility of human attempts to oppose God's will, as shepherds would be ineffective against a determined lion. This can be seen as a metaphor for nations or powers that attempt to thwart God's plans.<p><b>it is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their clamor&#8212;</b><br>The lion's indifference to the shepherds' noise illustrates God's unshakeable resolve and sovereignty. Human efforts, no matter how loud or numerous, cannot deter God's purposes. This reflects the biblical theme of God's omnipotence and the futility of resisting His will, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations' plots are in vain against the Lord.<p><b>so the LORD of Hosts will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and its heights.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme command over the heavenly armies, indicating His unmatched power and authority. Mount Zion, a central location in Jerusalem, holds significant spiritual and historical importance as the site of the Temple and God's dwelling place among His people. This phrase prophesies God's direct intervention and protection of Jerusalem, symbolizing His commitment to His covenant people. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over His enemies, a theme echoed in eschatological passages like <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ returns as a conquering King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is depicted as a powerful and fearless lion in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lion/young_lion.htm">Lion/Young Lion</a></b><br>Symbolizes strength, power, and fearlessness.

Homer<span class= "ital">, Il.,</span> 18:161.)<p><span class= "bld">To fight for Mount Zion.</span>--The preposition has been differently rendered as <span class= "ital">for, on, against. </span>The lion in the last case is claiming the sheep as his own prey, and will not suffer interference from without. Jehovah, using the Assyrian armies as His instruments, will fight against Jerusalem, and will not allow the Egyptian allies to interfere with His chastisements. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/29-7.htm" title="And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her fortification, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.">Isaiah 29:7-8</a>.) The second clause simply marks Jerusalem as the scene of the conflict, but agrees in substance with the first. Looking to the verse that follows, the idea of protection seems more natural than that of hostility. The thought of supreme ownership, however, includes both; Jerusalem belonged to Jehovah to protect or to chastise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - A PROMISE OF PROTECTION, AND OF THE DISCOMFITURE OF ASSYRIA. In the promise of protection (vers. 4, 5) there is nothing new but the imagery, which is of remarkable beauty. The promise is followed by a brief exhortation (vers. 6, 7); and then the discomfiture of Assyria is declared in the plainest terms, and her flight before the avenging sword of God (vers. 8, 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as the lion</span>, etc. The resemblance of this simile to Hem., 'Iliad,' 18:11. 161, 162, has been often noticed. In both, the lion has seized his prey, and is crouching over it; the shepherds gather themselves together against him, and seek to scare him away; but he remains firm, undaunted by their threats and cries, never for a moment relinquishing the body of which he has made himself the master. The image is best explained as representing Jehovah, standing over and keeping guard on Jerusalem, which he will allow, no one to rend from him. <span class="cmt_word">And the young lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the young lion</span> (Lowth). A single animal must be intended. <span class="cmt_word">Roaring on his prey</span>; rather, <span class="accented">growleth over his prey</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so shall the Lord of hosts descend</span>, <span class="accented">to fight</span>, <span class="accented">on Mount Zion</span>. If we connect the concluding words of the clause with <span class="accented">tsaba</span>, to fight, the meaning must be "fight against," as Delitzsch shows conclusively. But we may connect them with the more distant <span class="accented">yered</span>, will descend, in which case they will mean "on," or "<span class="accented">upon</span> Mount Zion" (comp. <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>). The best commentators are of opinion that this <span class="accented">must be</span> the sense. The words are a promise, not a threat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/31-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
