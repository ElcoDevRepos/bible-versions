Throughout the Bible, there is a recurring theme that emphasizes the fallibility and limitations of humanity. In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were often tempted to trust in political alliances and human leaders rather than in God. This warning echoes similar sentiments found in Psalms 118:8-9, which advises that it is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man or princes. The historical context of Isaiah includes the looming threat of Assyrian invasion, which led many to seek security in human alliances rather than divine protection.<p><b>who has only the breath in his nostrils</b><br>This phrase highlights the frailty and temporary nature of human life. The breath in one's nostrils is a metaphor for life itself, which is given and sustained by God. <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> describes God breathing life into Adam, underscoring that life is a divine gift. The imagery here serves to remind the reader of the transient and dependent nature of human existence. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, breath was often associated with life force, and its cessation marked death, reinforcing the idea that humans are not self-sufficient.<p><b>Of what account is he?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the insignificance of humans in comparison to the divine. It invites reflection on the futility of placing ultimate trust in human beings who are inherently limited and mortal. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3-4</a>, where David questions the significance of man, whose days are like a fleeting shadow. Theologically, this points to the necessity of placing trust in God, who is eternal and omnipotent, rather than in fallible human beings. The prophetic context of Isaiah often contrasts the sovereignty of God with the impotence of idols and human leaders, urging a return to faith in God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings in Judah.

In light of that coming humbling:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8&#8211;9</a> reminds us, &#8220;It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man&#8230;princes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a> echoes the danger: &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a> shifts the focus: &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart.&#8221;<p>The verse therefore calls believers to exchange self-reliance and hero-worship for wholehearted confidence in the Lord alone. Human leaders, however gifted, cannot provide the security, wisdom, or salvation God offers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has only the breath in his nostrils</b><p>The reason not to rely on people is their frailty. Humanity&#8217;s life-support system boils down to borrowed breath:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> shows God as the source: He &#8220;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14&#8211;15</a> points out how fragile that gift is: if God withdrew His breath, &#8220;all flesh would perish together.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;4</a> warns, &#8220;Do not put your trust in princes&#8230;when his breath departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.&#8221;<p>People may appear strong, but every inhalation proves their absolute dependence on God&#8217;s moment-by-moment sustenance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of what account is he?</b><p>Since mankind is so transient, Scripture asks, &#8220;Of what account is he?&#8221; The implied answer: next to nothing, apart from God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15, 17</a> says nations are &#8220;a drop in a bucket&#8230;less than nothing and empty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a> wonders, &#8220;What is man that You are mindful of him?&#8221; God values people, yet we must remember our smallness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> underscores life&#8217;s brevity: &#8220;You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&#8221;<p>The verse humbles arrogance, dismantles celebrity culture, and re-centers worth on the Creator rather than the creature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> urges God&#8217;s people to stop leaning on fallible humans and start leaning fully on the Lord. Because every person&#8217;s life depends on a single, fragile breath, human strength offers no lasting security. By exposing humanity&#8217;s fleeting nature, the verse redirects confidence toward the eternal, all-sufficient God&#8212;the only One worthy of absolute trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Cease ye from man </span>. . .--The verse is wanting in some MSS. of the LXX. version, and is rejected by some critics, as of the nature of a marginal comment, and as not in harmony with the context. The first fact is the most weighty argument against it, but is not decisive. The other objection does not count for much. To "cease from man" as well as from "idols" is surely the natural close of the great discourse which had begun with proclaiming that men of all classes and conditions should be brought low. The words "whose breath is in his nostrils" emphasise the frailty of human life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-22.htm" title="All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.">Genesis 7:22</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/146-3.htm" title="Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.">Psalm 146:3-4</a>). Looking to that frailty, the prophet asks, as the psalmist had asked, "What is man? (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm" title="O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.">Psalm 8:1</a>). What is he to be valued at?" If it could be proved that the verse was not Isaiah's, it is at least the reflection of a devout mind in harmony with his.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cease ye from man</span>.
