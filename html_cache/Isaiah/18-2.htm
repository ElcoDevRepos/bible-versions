The sending of couriers by sea indicates a well-organized and far-reaching communication network, suggesting the importance and influence of this nation. In the ancient world, sea travel was a significant means of communication and trade, highlighting the strategic and economic prowess of Cush. This also reflects the historical context where nations relied on maritime routes for diplomatic and commercial purposes.<p><b>in papyrus vessels on the waters</b><br>Papyrus vessels were lightweight boats made from the papyrus plant, common in the Nile region. These vessels were suitable for navigating the Nile and other waterways, emphasizing the ingenuity and adaptability of the Cushites. The use of papyrus boats underscores the connection to Egypt, where papyrus was abundant, and highlights the cultural and technological exchanges between these regions. This imagery also evokes the idea of swift and efficient travel, crucial for the delivery of important messages.<p><b>Go, swift messengers</b><br>The command to "go" suggests urgency and the importance of the message being delivered. The term "swift messengers" implies that the message is of great significance, requiring prompt delivery. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's message being sent to the nations, emphasizing the divine initiative in reaching out to all peoples. The swiftness of the messengers can also be seen as a reflection of the urgency of God's prophetic word.<p><b>to a people tall and smooth-skinned</b><br>This description of the Cushites highlights their distinct physical appearance, which was notable to the Israelites. The reference to being "tall and smooth-skinned" may indicate a sense of admiration or respect for their physical attributes. Historically, the Cushites were known for their stature and were often depicted in Egyptian art. This phrase also serves to identify the Cushites as a unique and recognizable group among the nations.<p><b>to a people widely feared</b><br>The Cushites were known for their military prowess and were considered a formidable force in the ancient world. Their reputation as a "widely feared" people underscores their strength and influence. This fear could be due to their strategic location, military capabilities, or alliances. The phrase reflects the geopolitical realities of the time, where nations were often in conflict and sought to assert their dominance.<p><b>to a powerful nation of strange speech</b><br>The reference to "strange speech" indicates a language barrier, highlighting the cultural and linguistic diversity of the ancient Near East. The Cushites spoke a language different from Hebrew, which would have seemed foreign to the Israelites. This phrase emphasizes the distinctiveness of the Cushite nation and their separation from Israel, both culturally and geographically. It also points to the broader theme of God's message reaching all nations, regardless of language or culture.<p><b>whose land is divided by rivers</b><br>The land of Cush was characterized by its many rivers, including the Nile and its tributaries. This geographical feature made the region fertile and strategically important. The division by rivers also suggests a land rich in resources and natural beauty. In a biblical context, rivers often symbolize life and abundance, and their mention here may allude to the prosperity and vitality of the Cushite nation. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all creation, including the nations and their lands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>Refers to the region south of Egypt, often associated with modern-day Sudan or Ethiopia.

God notices every courier, commands the journey, and frames each descriptive phrase to show His intimate knowledge of the people&#8217;s stature, reputation, language, and geography. While Cush impresses human eyes, its papyrus craft, feared armies, and mighty rivers remain subject to the Lord who guides history. The verse invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s sovereignty over all nations and to rest in His unmatched authority rather than in any human alliance or power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">That sendeth ambassadors . . .</span>--The words point to the embassies which the Ethiopian king had sent, in the papyrus boats used for the navigation of the Upper Nile, down that river to Hezekiah and other princes, inviting them to join the alliance against Assyria.<p><span class= "bld">Go, ye swift messengers . . .</span>--The interpolated "saying" being omitted, the words that follow are as the prophet's address to the messengers, as he sends them back to their own people. Instead of "scattered and peeled, "we are to read <span class= "ital">tall and polished, </span>as describing the <span class= "ital">physique </span>which had probably impressed itself on Isaiah's mind. (Comp. the Sabeans as "men of stature" in <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.">Isaiah 45:14</a>.) They were terrible then, as they had ever been (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>imperious and mighty), a nation <span class= "ital">that treadeth down </span>its foes. Instead of "meted out and trodden down," they are a nation of <span class= "ital">command, command </span>(or, perhaps, "strength, strength"). The rivers are literally the affluents of the Nile that <span class= "ital">intersect </span>and fertilise (not "spoil") the hills and valleys of Nubia. Some commentators, however, though with less probability, accept the Authorised version, and refer the words to Israel, as "scattered and plundered," with its land "spoiled" by the "rivers of invading armies (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That sendeth ambassadors</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">messengers</span>, as the word is translated in <a href="/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a> and <a href="/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>. They are sent, apparently, by the king to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">By the sea</span>. "The sea" must in this place necessarily mean the Nile, which is called "the sea" in <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a> certainly, and probably in <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>. Vessels of papyrus could not possibly have been employed in the very difficult navigation of the Red Sea. <span class="cmt_word">Vessels of bulrushes</span>. That some of the boats used upon the Nile were constructed of the papyrus (which is a sort of bulrush) we learn from Herodotus (it. 96), Theophrastus ('Hist. Plant.,' 4:9), Plutarch ('De Isid. et Osir.,' &sect; 18), Pliny (Hist. 'Nat.,' 6:22), and Lucan ('Pharsal.,' 4:136). They are represented occasionally on the Egyptian monuments. <span class="accented">Saying</span>. This word is interpolated by our translators, and gives a wrong sense. It is the prophet that addresses the messengers, not the king who sends them. <span class="cmt_word">To a nation scattered and peeled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tall and polished</span>, or <span class="accented">tall and sleek</span>. The word translated "scattered" means properly "drawn out," and seems to be applied here to the physique of the Ethiopians, whose stature is said to have been remarkable (Herod., 3:20, 114). The other epithet refers to the glossy skin of the people. <span class="cmt_word">A people terrible from their beginning hitherto</span>; The Israelites first knew the Ethiopians as soldiers when they formed a part of the army brought by Shishak (Sheshonk I.) against Rehoboam, about <span class="date">B.C. 970</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>). They had afterwards experience of their vast numbers, when Zerah made his attack upon Asa; but on this occasion they succeeded in defeating them (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-13</a>). It was not till about two centuries after this that the power of Ethiopia began to be really formidable to Egypt; and the "miserable Cushites," as they had been in the habit of calling them, acquired the preponderating influence in the valley of the Nile, and under Piankhi, Shabak, Shabatek, and Tirhakah (Tahark), reduced Egypt to subjection. Isaiah, perhaps, refers to their rise under Piankhi as "their beginning." <span class="cmt_word">A nation meted out and trodden down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a nation of meting out and trampling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one accustomed to mete out its neighbors' bounds with a measuring-line, and to trample other nations under its feet. <span class="cmt_word">Whose land the rivers have spoiled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose land rivers despoil</span>. The deposit of mud, which fertilizes Egypt, is washed by the rivers from Ethiopia, which is thus continually losing large quantities of rich son. This fact was well known to the Greeks (Herod., 2:12, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.), and there is no reason why Isaiah should not have been acquainted with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">which sends</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1448;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;l&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
