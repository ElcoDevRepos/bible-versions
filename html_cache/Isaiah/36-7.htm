Historically, this occurs during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem under King Sennacherib. The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and psychological warfare, often attempting to undermine the confidence of their enemies. Theologically, this statement tests the faith of the Israelites, echoing the broader biblical theme of trusting God in the face of overwhelming odds, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed,</b><br>Hezekiah's religious reforms are central here. He removed high places and altars to centralize worship in Jerusalem, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>. This was in obedience to Deuteronomic law, which prescribed a single place of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>). The Assyrian commander misinterprets these actions as weakening Judah's religious structure, not understanding that Hezekiah's reforms were meant to purify and strengthen the worship of Yahweh by eliminating idolatry.<p><b>saying to Judah and Jerusalem, &#8216;You must worship before this altar&#8217;?</b><br>The "altar" refers to the altar in the Temple of Jerusalem, the designated place for sacrifices and worship according to God's covenant with Israel. This centralization was intended to unify the nation under the true worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the syncretistic practices that had crept in over time. Theologically, this points to the importance of worshiping God as He commands, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who becomes the ultimate altar and sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms, including the removal of high places and altars to centralize worship in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered a message from King Sennacherib of Assyria, challenging the faith of the people of Judah in their God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, where Hezekiah reigned and sought to restore proper worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire at the time, threatening Judah with invasion and attempting to undermine their trust in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places_and_altars.htm">High Places and Altars</a></b><br>Sites of worship that were often used for idolatrous practices, which Hezekiah removed to purify the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_alone.htm">Trust in God Alone</a></b><br>Hezekiah's reforms remind us that true worship and trust must be directed solely to God, not diluted by idolatrous practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/centralized_worship.htm">Centralized Worship</a></b><br>The removal of high places underscores the importance of worshiping God as He prescribes, emphasizing obedience to His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/facing_challenges_with_faith.htm">Facing Challenges with Faith</a></b><br>Like Hezekiah, believers today are called to stand firm in their faith, even when external voices challenge their trust in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat through prayer demonstrates the importance of seeking God's guidance and intervention in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the Assyrian threat, the account reassures us of God's ultimate control and His ability to deliver His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_36_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 36:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_36_7_s_challenge_to_reliance_on_God.htm">How does Isaiah 36:7 challenge our understanding of true reliance on God?

In reality, those high places were idolatrous or unauthorized worship sites.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a> notes that Hezekiah &#8220;removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones, and cut down the Asherah poles.&#8221; This was obedience to <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, which commands the destruction of pagan sites.<p>&#8226; The Rabshakeh&#8217;s confusion illustrates how outsiders often interpret obedience to God as alienating Him, when it actually secures His favor.<p>&#8226; This distortion mirrors Satan&#8217;s tactic in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, twisting God&#8217;s commands to sow doubt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying to Judah and Jerusalem, &#8216;You must worship before this altar&#8217;?</b><p>Hezekiah had centralized worship at the Jerusalem temple, the one altar God Himself had designated.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>: &#8220;You are not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place&#8230; but only at the place the LORD will choose.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-2.htm">2 Chronicles 31:2</a> describes how Hezekiah organized the priests and Levites &#8220;to present burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the LORD&#8217;s dwelling.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Far from limiting access to God, centralization unified the nation around true worship. The Rabshakeh portrays it as deprivation, but Scripture presents it as purification.<p>&#8226; This also foreshadows Jesus&#8217; statement in <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a> that true worshipers will worship &#8220;in spirit and in truth&#8221;&#8212;in God&#8217;s prescribed way rather than human invention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/36-7.htm">Isaiah 36:7</a> records a mocking challenge: the Assyrian accuses Judah of trusting a God supposedly angered by Hezekiah&#8217;s removal of high places. Scripture shows the opposite: Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms pleased the LORD, aligning with His Word. The enemy&#8217;s taunt exposes a common tactic&#8212;misrepresenting obedience as folly&#8212;to erode faith. The verse thus calls readers to discern genuine trust, cling to God&#8217;s revealed commands, and recognize that true worship, centered on God&#8217;s appointed altar, is never a liability but the very ground of deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Is it not he, whose high places . . .</span>--This was this impression left on the mind of the Rabshakeh by what he heard of Hezekiah's reformation. From the Assyrian stand-point a god was honoured in proportion as his sanctuaries were multiplied, but wherever he went, the Rabshakeh had found "high places "where Jehovah had been worshipped, which Hezekiah had desecrated. How could one who had so acted hope for the protection of his God?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou say to me, We trust in the Lord</span>. "The Assyrians," it has been observed, "had a good intelligence department" (Cheyne). It was known to Sennacherib that Hezekiah had a confident trust, which seemed to him wholly irrational, in Jehovah - the special God of his people. It was also known to him that Hezekiah, in the earlier portion of his reign (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), had "removed the high places" and broken down the altars, where Jehovah had for centuries been worshipped throughout the length and breadth of the land. He concludes that, in so doing, he must have offended Jehovah. He is probably ignorant of the peculiar proviso of the Jewish Law, that sacrifice should be offered in one place only, and conceives that Hezekiah has been actuated by some narrow motive, and has acted in the interests of one city only, not of the whole people. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall worship before this altar</span>.

Hezekiah had cleansed it front the pollutions of the time of Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>), and had insisted on sacrifice being offered nowhere else (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21-35</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-15.htm">2 Chronicles 30:15-24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>, etc.). Such a concentration of worship was unknown to any of the heathen nations, and may well have been unintelligible to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/36-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
