Unlike human leaders who may falter, the Servant remains steadfast. This reflects the divine nature of Christ, who, despite facing immense opposition and suffering, did not waver in His mission (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2-3</a>). The resilience of the Servant is a model for believers, encouraging them to persevere in faith and righteousness.<p><b>before He has established justice on the earth.</b><br>The mission of the Servant is to bring about justice, a central theme in the prophetic literature. This justice is not merely legal fairness but encompasses righteousness, peace, and the restoration of God's order. The phrase points to the eschatological hope of a future where God's will is fully realized on earth, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. The establishment of justice is a key aspect of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ reigns with equity and truth (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<p><b>In His law the islands will put their hope.</b><br>The "islands" or "coastlands" symbolize distant nations, indicating the universal scope of the Servant's mission. This reflects the Abrahamic promise that all nations will be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The reference to "His law" suggests a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God's law is written on the hearts of people. The hope placed in His law signifies the transformative power of the Gospel, which brings salvation and hope to all corners of the earth, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This passage refers to the "Servant of the Lord," a prophetic figure often understood in Christian theology as a reference to Jesus Christ.
