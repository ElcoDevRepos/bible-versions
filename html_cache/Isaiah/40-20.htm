The context here is the futility of idol worship, contrasting the living God with lifeless idols. In biblical times, offerings were a significant part of worship, and those who lacked wealth would seek alternative means to fulfill their religious obligations. This highlights the socio-economic disparities present in ancient societies.<p><b>chooses wood that will not rot</b><br>The choice of durable wood signifies an attempt to create a lasting idol, reflecting the human desire for permanence in worship objects. In the ancient Near East, certain types of wood, like cedar, were prized for their resistance to decay. This choice underscores the irony of trying to create something eternal from perishable materials, contrasting with the eternal nature of God. The use of wood also connects to other biblical passages where wood is used symbolically, such as the Ark of the Covenant and the cross of Christ.<p><b>He seeks a skilled craftsman</b><br>The involvement of a skilled craftsman indicates the importance placed on the appearance and craftsmanship of idols. This reflects the cultural value of artistry and the belief that the skill of the maker could imbue the idol with power or significance. In the broader biblical narrative, this contrasts with the creation account where God alone is the Creator, needing no human assistance. The reliance on human skill highlights the limitations of idols compared to the omnipotence of God.<p><b>to set up an idol that will not topple</b><br>The concern for stability in an idol underscores the inherent weakness and instability of man-made gods. This phrase points to the absurdity of worshiping something that requires human intervention to remain upright. In the historical context, idols were often placed in temples or shrines, and their physical stability was a practical concern. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>, where the idol Dagon falls before the Ark of the Covenant, illustrating the superiority of the true God over false gods. Theologically, this points to the steadfastness of God, who does not need human support to sustain His existence or power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.

Verse 19 pictures the wealthy casting images of gold; verse 20 turns to &#8220;one lacking such an offering&#8221;&#8212;the person without means.<p>- Poverty does not insulate anyone from idolatry. Whether rich or poor, the human heart still seeks a tangible substitute for the invisible God (<a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22-23</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6-8</a>).<p>- Even the needy will divert limited resources toward an object of worship rather than call on the living Lord who &#8220;gives strength to the weary&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chooses wood that will not rot</b><p>- Because he cannot afford gold or silver, he selects durable wood, hoping for something that will last.<p>- The choice exposes the illusion of permanence. Trees decay (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>), yet the idolater convinces himself that careful material selection can produce an enduring god.<p>- Isaiah later mocks the same practice: &#8220;He plants a pine&#8230; then takes some of it to warm himself&#8230; from the rest he makes a god&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14-17</a>).<p>- Like moth-eaten riches (<a href="/james/5-2.htm">James 5:2-3</a>) or &#8220;treasures on earth&#8221; that rust (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>), even the best wood cannot escape time&#8217;s corruption&#8212;unlike the eternal Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He seeks a skilled craftsman</b><p>- Since his chosen material is common, he relies on human artistry to elevate it. Craftsmanship becomes the savior of this would-be deity.<p>- Scripture repeatedly exposes the folly of worshiping what human hands have fashioned (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>; <a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24-26</a>).<p>- The effort is backward: instead of humankind being shaped by the Creator (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>), the creature shapes the creator.<p>- Skill cannot transform lifeless wood into the living God who alone &#8220;stretches out the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To set up an idol that will not topple</b><p>- Stability is the idolater&#8217;s final concern. A fallen statue would reveal powerlessness, so he engineers a base &#8220;that will not topple.&#8221;<p>- Yet Scripture records gods that collapse before the Lord, such as Dagon bowing before the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>) and Baal remaining silent on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26-29</a>).<p>- Jeremiah echoes Isaiah: idols &#8220;must be carried, because they cannot walk&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/10-4.htm">Jeremiah 10:4-5</a>). Contrast this with the Lord who &#8220;upholds all things by His powerful word&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>- The very need to stabilize the idol exposes its emptiness; true Deity sustains the universe, not vice versa.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/40-20.htm">Isaiah 40:20</a> spotlights the absurd lengths to which people&#8212;rich or poor&#8212;will go to create a god in their own image.
