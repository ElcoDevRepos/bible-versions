In the context of Isaiah, the prophet is speaking to the Israelites during a time of exile and uncertainty, reminding them of God's ultimate authority over all earthly powers. Historically, the nations surrounding Israel, such as Assyria and Babylon, were seen as mighty and formidable. However, this passage underscores that, in God's eyes, even the greatest empires are insignificant. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations' attempts to defy God are met with divine laughter. Theologically, this highlights God's omnipotence and the futility of human pride and power against His will.<p><b>He regards them as nothingness and emptiness.</b><br>The terms "nothingness" and "emptiness" convey the idea of void and lack of substance. This reflects the biblical theme of the transient nature of human achievements and the futility of relying on worldly power. In the cultural context of Isaiah's time, nations often boasted of their strength and accomplishments, yet this passage reminds believers that true significance and value are found only in God. This concept is further illustrated in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the impermanence of earthly treasures in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>. Additionally, the prophetic nature of Isaiah's message points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who establishes a kingdom not of this world, as seen in <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>. This serves as a call to place trust and hope in God's eternal kingdom rather than in temporal powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
