Historically, Tyre was a significant maritime power, and its wealth was derived from its strategic location and trade networks. The setting apart of profits to the LORD indicates a transformation from secular to sacred use, suggesting a future dedication of resources to God's purposes. This reflects the biblical principle of consecration, where material wealth is redirected to serve divine purposes, as seen in the dedication of spoils in <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>.<p><b>they will not be stored or saved,</b><br>The idea that the profits will not be stored or saved implies a shift from accumulation for personal or national gain to immediate use for God's purposes. This contrasts with the typical practice of hoarding wealth for security or future needs, as critiqued in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where Jesus warns against storing up earthly treasures. The emphasis here is on the transient nature of material wealth and the call to prioritize spiritual over material security.<p><b>for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD,</b><br>This phrase suggests that the wealth of Tyre will benefit those who are devoted to God, possibly referring to the priests or the people of Israel who serve in the temple. It highlights a redistribution of resources from a pagan city to the covenant community, aligning with the biblical theme of God using the wealth of the nations for His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-7</a>. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where the wealth of the world is ultimately used to support the mission and ministry of God's kingdom.<p><b>for abundant food and fine clothing.</b><br>The provision of abundant food and fine clothing signifies the meeting of both basic and luxurious needs, indicating God's provision and blessing. In biblical times, food and clothing were primary indicators of wealth and prosperity. This echoes the promise of God's provision for His people, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>, where Jesus assures that God will provide for those who seek His kingdom. The mention of fine clothing also alludes to the priestly garments, symbolizing purity and service to God, as described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade.

God declares that even the city&#8217;s commercial gain will ultimately belong to Him.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the principle, &#8220;Honor the LORD with your wealth&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). All resources, even those gathered in pagan settings, are under His sovereign claim (<a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when Jerusalem&#8217;s bells are inscribed &#8220;Holy to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20-21</a>), signaling that ordinary items can be consecrated for sacred use.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will not be stored or saved</b><p>&#8226; Tyre&#8217;s future wealth won&#8217;t be hoarded in vaults.

Isaiah echoes that warning: divine wealth is meant for circulation, not accumulation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For her profit will go to those who live before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;live before the LORD&#8221; points to God-honoring people&#8212;priests, prophets, and all who walk in covenant fidelity (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; In Hezekiah&#8217;s day temple servants received offerings so they could &#8220;devote themselves to the Law of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-4.htm">2 Chronicles 31:4</a>). Likewise, Tyre&#8217;s future earnings will support faithful worshipers.<p>&#8226; Paul thanks Philippian believers that their gift became &#8220;a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Isaiah anticipates a similar redirection of commerce to Kingdom purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For abundant food and fine clothing</b><p>&#8226; God ensures practical provision for His servants: &#8220;I will bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/132-15.htm">Psalm 132:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus assures, &#8220;Seek first the kingdom&#8230;and all these things will be added to you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>)&#8212;food and clothing included.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;abundant food and fine clothing&#8221; imply dignity, not luxury: workers in God&#8217;s presence are supplied generously so they can serve unhindered (<a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a> promises that Tyre&#8217;s once-pagan profits will be consecrated to the LORD, not hoarded but redistributed to sustain those who faithfully serve Him. Wealth surrendered to God moves from self-centered accumulation to life-giving provision, demonstrating His sovereign ability to transform commerce into worship and supply every need of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord.</span>--The words seem to reverse the rule of <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm" title="You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>, which, probably not without a reference to practices like those connected with the worship of Mylitta (Herod., i. 99), forbade gifts that were so gained from being offered in the Sanctuary. Here, it seems to be implied, the imagery was not to be carried to what might have seemed its logical conclusion. The harlot city, penitent and converted, might be allowed, strange as it might seem, to bring the gains of her harlotry into the temple of the Lord. Interpreted religiously, the prophet sees the admission of proselytes to the worship of Israel in the future, as he had seen it probably in the days of Hezekiah (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a>). Interpreted politically, the words point to a return to the old alliance between Judah and Tyre in the days of David and Solomon (<a href="/context/1_kings/5-1.htm" title="And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.">1Kings 5:1-12</a>), and to the gifts which that alliance involved (<a href="/psalms/45-12.htm" title="And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.">Psalm 45:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For them that dwell before the Lord . . .</span>--These were probably, in the prophet's thoughts, the citizens of Jerusalem, who were to find in Tyre their chief resource both for food and raiment. Traces of this commerce after the return of the Jews from the captivity are found in <a href="/nehemiah/13-16.htm" title="There dwelled men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 13:16</a>, "men of Tyre" bringing "fish and all manner of ware" to the gates of Jerusalem. Of the more direct service we find evidence in the fact that Tyrians and Zidonians contributed to the erection of the second Temple, as they had done to that of the first (<a href="/ezra/3-7.htm" title="They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.">Ezra 3:7</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord</span>. There is nothing intrinsically wrong or debasing in commerce. Rightly pursued, and engaged in with the view of devoting the profits made in it to good and pious ends, the commercial life may be as religious, and as acceptable to God as any other. The world has known many merchants who were Christians, in the highest sense of the word. Solomon in his best days was a merchant (<a href="/1_kings/9-27.htm">1 Kings 9:27, 28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), but one who employed the wealth which he derived from commerce to the honor and glory of God. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be treasured nor laid up</span>. The merchants shall not lay it up in their own coffers, but expend it wisely and religiously. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be for them that dwell before the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it shall be applied to religious uses - to the sustentation of ministers, the relief of the poor and necessitous among God's people, and other similar purposes. Such an employment of the gains made sanctifies commerce, and makes it a good and a blessed thing. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/23-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet her profits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(sa&#7717;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
