Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, but its influence was waning during this period. The Bible often warns against relying on foreign powers instead of God (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme of trusting in God rather than human strength or alliances (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>that splintered reed of a staff</b><br>The imagery of a "splintered reed" suggests something unreliable and fragile. Reeds were common in Egypt, often used metaphorically to describe weakness (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). This metaphor highlights the futility of relying on Egypt, as it cannot provide the support Judah seeks. The Bible frequently uses such imagery to contrast human frailty with divine strength (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>).<p><b>that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the danger and harm that come from relying on Egypt. Instead of providing support, Egypt would cause injury, symbolizing betrayal and failure. This serves as a warning against alliances that seem beneficial but ultimately lead to downfall. The Bible often illustrates the consequences of misplaced trust (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>).<p><b>Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him</b><br>Pharaoh represents the leadership and power of Egypt, which was seen as a potential ally against Assyria. However, the historical context shows that Egypt was unable to deliver on its promises, as seen in the failed military support during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem.

There had been times when Egypt was a strong power, feared and respected by her neighbours, and a terror even to Assyria. But these times were long past. For the last fifty years the country had been divided against itself (see the comment on Isaiah 19:2), split up into a number of petty principalities, Recently the neighbouring kingdom of Ethiopia had claimed and exercised a species of sovereignty over the entire Nile valley, while allowing tributary princes to govern different portions of it. Of these princes the most important at the time of Rabshakeh's embassy seems to have been Shabatok, who reigned in Memphis, probably from <span class="date">B.C. 712</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Egypt is likened to a "bruised reed" on account of her untrustworthincss. "So" (Sabaco) had given no substantial help to Hashes. Shabatok was little likely to imperil himself in order to assist Hezekiah. Even Tirhakah would probably avoid, as long as he could, a conflict with the full power of Assyria. Pharaoh, King of Egypt. Sennacherib uses the generic term, "Pharaoh," instead of mentioning any of the petty princes by name, because he means to speak generally. The King of Egypt, under present circumstances, whoever he may be, is no better than a bruised reed. In his own inscriptions, Sennacherib about this time uses the expression, "the kings of Egypt" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 1.47). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/36-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Look now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are trusting</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1441;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7789;a&#7717;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_982.htm">Strong's 982: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trust, be confident, sure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Egypt,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
