His role was not only to foretell future events but also to provide guidance and counsel. This phrase indicates that Isaiah is speaking with authority, likely under divine inspiration, as he often did throughout his ministry.<p><b>Prepare a lump of pressed figs</b><br>Figs were a common fruit in ancient Israel, known for their medicinal properties. The use of figs here reflects the practical application of natural remedies in biblical times. This instruction aligns with the cultural practices of using available resources for healing purposes. The preparation of figs as a poultice suggests a blend of faith and practical action, where divine instruction meets human effort.<p><b>and apply it to the boil</b><br>The boil mentioned here could refer to a serious skin infection or abscess, which was a common ailment in ancient times. The application of the fig poultice is a specific remedy, indicating a direct intervention for a physical ailment. This reflects the understanding of disease and treatment in the ancient Near East, where physical and spiritual health were often interconnected.<p><b>and he will recover</b><br>This promise of recovery is significant, as it demonstrates the power of God to heal through both natural and supernatural means. It also underscores the role of faith and obedience in the healing process. The assurance of recovery can be seen as a testament to God's mercy and faithfulness, as well as a fulfillment of His promises. This phrase connects to other biblical instances where faith and obedience lead to healing, such as in the New Testament accounts of Jesus healing the sick.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and the salvation of the Lord.

They were to Israel, especially in the case of leprosy and other kindred diseases, what the priests of Asclepios were to Greece. The Divine promise guaranteed success to the use of natural remedies, but did not dispense with them, and they, like the spittle laid on the eyes of the blind in the Gospel miracles (<a href="/mark/7-33.htm" title="And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;">Mark 7:33</a>, <a href="/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>), were also a help to the faith on which the miracle depended.
