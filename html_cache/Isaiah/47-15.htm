In the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47</a>, God is pronouncing judgment on Babylon, a nation known for its reliance on magic and divination. The phrase indicates a shift from reliance on these practices to the realization of their futility.<p><b>those with whom you have labored and traded from youth&#8212;</b><br>Babylon was a major center of commerce and trade in the ancient world, known for its wealth and influence. The phrase suggests a long-standing relationship, emphasizing that these advisors and merchants have been integral to Babylon's identity and prosperity. Historically, Babylon's economy was heavily reliant on trade, and its culture was deeply intertwined with the practices of divination and astrology.<p><b>each one strays in his own direction;</b><br>This indicates the abandonment and disunity among those who were once allies or trusted advisors. In times of crisis, rather than providing support, they scatter. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the unreliability of human alliances compared to the steadfastness of God. It also echoes the scattering of the nations at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>), highlighting the futility of human efforts apart from God.<p><b>not one of them can save you.</b><br>The ultimate message is the impotence of Babylon's trusted advisors and allies in the face of divine judgment. This underscores the biblical principle that salvation and deliverance come only from God, not from human wisdom or power. It connects to other scriptures that emphasize God's sovereignty and the futility of trusting in anything other than Him, such as <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, which warns against putting trust in princes or mortal men who cannot save.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire addressed in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47</a>, symbolizing pride and self-reliance.
