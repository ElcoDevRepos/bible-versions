It reflects the prophetic vision of the return of the exiles, a theme prevalent in Isaiah. The idea of gathering from afar also foreshadows the New Testament's message of the Gospel reaching the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>from the north and from the west</b><br>The mention of directions indicates the widespread nature of the return. Historically, the north could refer to regions like Assyria and Babylon, where the Israelites were exiled. The west might point towards the Mediterranean regions, suggesting a broader scope of return. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>, where God promises to gather His people from the north country and the coasts of the earth.<p><b>and from the land of Aswan</b><br>Aswan, located in southern Egypt, represents the southernmost boundary of the known world to the Israelites. This inclusion signifies the extent of God's reach and the fulfillment of His promise to gather His people from the ends of the earth. It also highlights the historical context of Jewish communities in Egypt, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>, where Jews fled to Egypt during the Babylonian conquest. The mention of Aswan underscores the comprehensive nature of God's redemption plan, encompassing all directions and peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

That pledge now echoes in fuller stereo.<p>&#8226; Jesus amplifies this reach: &#8220;I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). Calvary became the magnet for souls near and far.<p>&#8226; Revelation picks up the theme: &#8220;A multitude&#8230;from every nation and tribe and people and tongue&#8221; stands before the throne (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). Isaiah foresaw that scene centuries early.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the north and from the west</b><p>God narrows the lens with directional markers: &#8220;from the north and from the west.&#8221; These aren&#8217;t random compass points.<p>&#8226; The north. Exile to Assyria and Babylon carried Israel northward; return would logically trace the same route back (<a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The west.

Isaiah already hinted that &#8220;the coastlands wait for His law&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>). Paul later pushed the gospel along those seaways to Rome (<a href="/bsb/acts/27.htm">Acts 27&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; Together, north and west suggest completeness&#8212;God gathers both covenant exiles and distant Gentiles, proving He &#8220;shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> confirms this rounded compass: God &#8220;will assemble the banished of Israel and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from the land of Aswan</b><p>The verse finishes: &#8220;and from the land of Aswan.&#8221; Ancient readers would picture the far-south frontier of Egypt.<p>&#8226; Aswan (often identified with Syene) sat at Egypt&#8217;s southern edge, hundreds of miles from Jerusalem.

Isaiah&#8217;s Aswan echoes that same southern horizon.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a> gives a preview: an Ethiopian official&#8212;traveling from the region just beyond Aswan&#8212;meets Philip, believes, and carries the gospel southward. The Servant&#8217;s prophecy in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> springs to life before our eyes.<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the mention of a specific distant locale assures Israel that no boundary, desert, or empire will stop God from reclaiming His people and welcoming others into His covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a> paints a panoramic canvas of God&#8217;s saving reach. From remote lands, scattered exiles and curious Gentiles stream toward the Servant&#8217;s light. Compass points&#8212;north, west, even distant Aswan&#8212;prove that no distance is too great, no people group too obscure, for the Lord who gathers.

In <a href="/psalms/107-3.htm" title="And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.">Psalm 107:3</a>, however, it clearly stands for the south, and is probably used in that sense here. In this case "from far" stands for the south, probably for the distant Ethiopia, where Jewish exiles had already found their way (<a href="/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">From the land of Sinim.</span>--The region thus named is clearly the <span class= "ital">ultima Thule </span>of the prophet's horizon, and this excludes the "Sinites" of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-17.htm" title="And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,">Genesis 10:17</a>), and the Sin (Pelusium) of Egypt. Modern scholars are almost unanimous in making it refer to the Chinese. Ph?nician or Babylonian commerce may have made that people known, at least by name, to the prophet. Recent Chinese researches have brought to light traditions that in B.C. 2353 (and again in B.C. 1110) a people came from a strange western land, bringing with them a tortoise, on the shell of which was a history of the world, in strange characters "like tadpoles." It is inferred that this was a cuneiform inscription, and the theory has been recently maintained that this was the origin of the present Chinese mode of writing. (See Cheyne's "Excursus," 2 p. 20, and an elaborate article on "China and Assyria" in the <span class= "ital">Quarterly Review </span>for October, 1882.) Porcelain with Chinese characters has been found, it may be added, in the ruins of the Egyptian Thebes (Wilkinson, <span class= "ital">Ancient Egyptians, </span>1st ser., iii. 106-109). All recent discoveries tend to the conclusion that the commerce of the great ancient monarchies was wider than scholars of the sixteenth century imagined. The actual immigration of Jews into China is believed to have taken place about B.C. 200 (Delitzsch <span class= "ital">in loc</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These shall come from far</span>.

And if "the sea" means "the south" in the preceding clause, the Sinim may be these of Phoenicia (<a href="/genesis/10-17.htm">Genesis 10:17</a>), who were among the furthest inhabitants of Asia towards the west.
