In the context of Isaiah, the prophet is speaking during a time of impending judgment and uncertainty for Israel. Waiting for the LORD signifies a deep trust in God's plan and timing, even when immediate circumstances seem dire. This echoes the sentiment found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, which encourages believers to "wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart." The act of waiting is not passive but involves active faith and hope in God's promises.<p><b>who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob</b><br>The imagery of God hiding His face suggests a period of divine displeasure or judgment. In the Old Testament, God's face represents His favor and presence. When He hides His face, it indicates a withdrawal of His blessing due to the people's sin and rebellion. The "house of Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel, highlighting their covenant relationship with God. This phrase reflects the historical context of Israel's disobedience and the resulting consequences, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, where God warns of hiding His face due to Israel's future unfaithfulness.<p><b>I will put my trust in Him</b><br>This declaration of trust is a personal commitment to rely on God's faithfulness despite the circumstances. Trusting in God is a central theme throughout the Bible, exemplified by figures like Abraham, who "believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness" (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). In the New Testament, this trust is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's faithfulness and love. The act of trusting God involves surrendering one's own understanding and control, as encouraged in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, and is a key aspect of a believer's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's messages to the people of Judah.

Just as <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> urges, &#8220;Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous,&#8221; the prophet chooses steadfast hope over panic.<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s context includes looming Assyrian invasion (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7&#8211;8</a>). While Judah trembles, the faithful remnant chooses to &#8220;stand still and see the salvation of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Waiting affirms God&#8217;s perfect timing. <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.&#8221; When circumstances press, faith refuses to be hurried.<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is true in every detail, the call to wait is more than ancient counsel; it is a present command for every believer facing uncertainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob</b><p>&#8226; The phrase describes divine discipline, not abandonment. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a> foretells, &#8220;I will hide My face from them because of all the evil they have done.&#8221; God&#8217;s holiness demands He respond to covenant unfaithfulness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hiding His face&#8221; signals the withdrawal of favor&#8212;loss of protection, guidance, and blessing&#8212;yet His covenant promises remain intact (<a href="/leviticus/26-44.htm">Leviticus 26:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in discipline, the Lord&#8217;s purpose is corrective. <a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a> assures, &#8220;Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.&#8221; His hidden face beckons repentance, encouraging the nation to return.<p>&#8226; The literalness of the text underscores real historical judgment on Judah, validating that God&#8217;s warnings are not symbolic threats but actual events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will put my trust in Him</b><p>&#8226; Isaiah moves from national judgment to personal faith. While many stumble (<a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>), he anchors his soul in the Lord alone. <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> echoes this refuge: &#8220;The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Trust complements waiting; one sustains the other. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a> directs, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart&#8230; and He will make your paths straight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; New Testament writers apply this verse to Christ. <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a> cites, &#8220;I will put My trust in Him,&#8221; linking Isaiah&#8217;s confidence to Messiah&#8217;s own reliance on the Father.<p>&#8226; Genuine trust expresses itself through obedience. Isaiah continues in 8:20, &#8220;To the law and to the testimony!&#8221;&#8212;a call to cling to God&#8217;s revealed word when culture drifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Isaiah models a three-fold response in crisis: deliberate waiting, sober recognition of divine discipline, and unwavering personal trust. Though God&#8217;s face is momentarily hidden from the nation, the prophet&#8217;s faith shines all the brighter, demonstrating that hope is never in circumstances but in the unchanging character of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face . . .</span>--The words come in somewhat abruptly, but not to the extent that justifies the assumption of some critics that a verse has been lost. The prophet enforces precept by example. He has learnt to conquer the feverish desire to know the future, which led men to trust in soothsayers and diviners, and from which even his own disciples were not altogether exempt. He is content to "wait," even though Jehovah "hide His face," though predictions seem to fail (see Note on <a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1</a>), and all seems dark and hopeless. There is, perhaps, a contrast between the fact that Jehovah hides His face from the house of Jacob, that all is dark for the nation's life as such, while yet the prophet, in his own individuality, can "look for Him" with the eye of faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - ISAIAH DEFINES HIS OWN ATTITUDE AND THAT OF HIS CHILDREN. It is questioned whether something has not fallen out between vers. 16 and 17. The transition is exceedingly abrupt, undoubtedly; but perhaps not more abrupt than elsewhere in Isaiah and the prophets contemporary with him. The Divine "instruction" comes to an end in ver. 16; and Isaiah might have been expected to comment on it, or enforce its teaching; but he does neither. He simply states what his own attitude will be under the coming calamity (ver. 8). He will "wait for the Lord and look to him" (ver. 17), and consider himself and his children as doing a work for God in being "signs" (ver. 18) - signs to which the rest of Israel may look, and from which they may derive sufficient hope and confidence to carry them through the dark time which is approaching. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will wait upon the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will wait for the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "await the time of his relenting" (see <a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That hideth his face from the house of Jacob</span> (compare the threats in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>). The light of God's countenance is to the spiritual what that of the sun is to the material world. All life, health, joy, happiness, proceed from it. This light was now to be withdrawn for a time on account of the people's sins. But Isaiah would "wait" for its reappearance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will wait</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;ik&#183;k&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
