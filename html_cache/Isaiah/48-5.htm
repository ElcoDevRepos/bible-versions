In the context of Isaiah, God is speaking to the Israelites, reminding them that He has revealed His plans and purposes well in advance. This is consistent with the biblical theme of prophecy, where God communicates future events to His people through prophets. The declaration "long ago" underscores God's eternal nature and His control over history, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<p><b>I announced it before it came to pass,</b><br>Here, God highlights His ability to predict future events accurately, distinguishing Him from false gods and idols. This serves as evidence of His divine authority and power. The historical context involves the Babylonian exile and the eventual return of the Israelites, events that were foretold by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. This foretelling is a testament to God's faithfulness and His covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>so that you could not claim,</b><br>This phrase indicates God's intention to prevent the Israelites from attributing His works to false gods. It reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where idolatry was a persistent issue. By revealing His plans beforehand, God removes any basis for the Israelites to credit their idols with His actions, reinforcing the first commandment against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>&#8216;My idol has done this;</b><br>Idolatry was a significant problem in Israel's history, often leading them away from true worship of Yahweh. This phrase captures the tendency of the Israelites to attribute divine acts to their idols. The biblical narrative frequently condemns idol worship, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, which mock the futility of idols. This serves as a reminder of the spiritual blindness that can result from idolatry.<p><b>my carved image and molten god has ordained it.&#8217;</b><br>The reference to "carved image and molten god" highlights the physical nature of idols, contrasting them with the living God. In the ancient Near East, idols were often crafted from wood, stone, or metal, and were believed to possess power. However, the Bible consistently portrays them as powerless and lifeless (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). This phrase underscores the folly of trusting in man-made objects rather than the Creator, and it points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the true image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

The declaration here made is that God rendered his prophecies more than ordinarily marvellous on account of Israel's obstinacy, not punishing them for it, lint seeking graciously and lovingly to overcome it by adding to the weight of the evidence to which he would fain have had it yield. Had his prophecies been less astonishing, had they in a less degree transcended ordinary human experience, Israel might conceivably have ascribed them and the accomplishment of them to the false gods. As it was, this was barely possible. <span class="cmt_word">Mine idol... my molten image</span>. It has been already observed (see the comment on Isaiah 40:18) that there was a strong tendency to idolatry among the Jews, not only before, but during the Captivity. Ezekiel says that those among whom he lived were "polluted after the manner of their fathers, and committed whoredom after their abominations; made their sons pass through the fire, and polluted themselves with <span class="accented">all their idols"</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30, 31</a>); nay, went so far as to declare boldly, "We will be as the heathen, as the inhabitants of the countries, to <span class="accented">serve wood and stone"</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>). The "prevailing tendency," as Delitzsch remarks, was "to combine the worship of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether for the latter." We cannot conclude anything concerning the mass of the community from the character of those who returned. Those who returned were the sincere worshippers of Jehovah - the irreligious did not care to return. It is always to be borne in mind that it was "the great mass even of Judah," no less than of Israel, that "remained behind" (Delitzsch); and these "became absorbed into the heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated" (ibid.). <span class="cmt_word">Hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">commanded them</span>;
