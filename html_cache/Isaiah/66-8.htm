In the context of Isaiah, this refers to the miraculous restoration and rebirth of Israel. Historically, the return from Babylonian exile was a significant event, but the ultimate fulfillment is often seen in the establishment of the modern state of Israel in 1948. This event was indeed unheard of, as a nation was reestablished after centuries of dispersion.<p><b>Who has seen such things?</b><br>The repetition of the rhetorical question underscores the miraculous and divine intervention required for such an event. In biblical history, the restoration of Israel is unparalleled, highlighting God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises. This also points to the eschatological hope of a future restoration and peace for Israel, as prophesied throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Can a country be born in a day or a nation be delivered in an instant?</b><br>This phrase speaks to the suddenness and miraculous nature of Israel's rebirth. The imagery of birth is significant, as it suggests both pain and joy, struggle and triumph. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of regeneration and new birth in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>, where Jesus speaks of being "born again." The suddenness of the event also reflects the power of God to accomplish His purposes swiftly and decisively.<p><b>Yet as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children.</b><br>Zion, representing Jerusalem and by extension the people of Israel, is depicted as a mother giving birth. This imagery is rich in prophetic literature, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises and the emergence of a new era. The labor pains suggest the trials and tribulations Israel faced, yet the birth signifies the joy and fulfillment of God's covenant. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who through His suffering (labor) brought forth the Church (children), as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, where Jesus is described as the "author and perfecter of faith."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used as a synonym for Jerusalem, Zion represents the people of God and the spiritual center of Israel.

The image is legal-witness language, underscoring the reliability of what God will perform.<p>&#8226; God frequently calls heaven and earth to witness His works (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; What is coming will not remain theoretical; it will be visible, verifiable history, just as Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egypt was openly seen (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-2.htm">Deuteronomy 29:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking who has actually seen anything comparable, Isaiah is distinguishing God&#8217;s plan from all merely human schemes (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can a country be born in a day or a nation be delivered in an instant?</b><p>Now the prophet poses an impossible scenario by human reckoning. Nations normally rise through long processes&#8212;migration, conquest, diplomacy&#8212;but God says He can create one in a moment.<p>&#8226; The pattern of sudden divine reversals runs through Scripture: Joseph moves from prison to palace overnight (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14-41</a>), and the church is birthed when the Spirit falls at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-41</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a> foretells Israel&#8217;s dry bones coming to life &#8220;very quickly&#8221; once God breathes on them.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a> anticipates a future day when &#8220;all Israel will be saved,&#8221; echoing Isaiah&#8217;s vision of an instantaneous national redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children.</b><p>Here is the explanation of the marvel: Zion&#8217;s labor is real, but the delivery is sudden and successful&#8212;no prolonged agony, no miscarried hope.<p>&#8226; The picture aligns with <a href="/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7</a>, where the child arrives before the pains begin, highlighting God&#8217;s sovereign timing.<p>&#8226; In Old Testament usage, &#8220;Zion&#8221; often represents both the city of Jerusalem and the covenant people. <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1-5</a> draws on the same imagery of a woman giving birth to a male child who will rule the nations.<p>&#8226; Historically, Israel&#8217;s return from Babylonian exile (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) foreshadowed this promise, but the ultimate fulfillment stretches further&#8212;to the birth of the church (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26-28</a>) and to Israel&#8217;s future national restoration when they recognize Messiah (<a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The quick birth underscores grace: God brings forth life where human effort could never suffice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/66-8.htm">Isaiah 66:8</a> dramatizes God&#8217;s power to accomplish salvation in ways that defy normal expectations. By stacking questions of unheard-of, unseen wonders, the prophet draws us to a climax: Zion will experience a rapid, decisive deliverance that only the Lord can engineer. Whether seen in the historical return from exile, the explosive birth of the New-Covenant people at Pentecost, or the prophesied future redemption of Israel, the verse testifies that God can create a nation, a people, in a single, sovereign moment. His promises never stall; when the time comes, redemption arrives swiftly and certainly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Shall the earth be made . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Shall a land be made to travail. </span>The usually slow processes of national development are contrasted with the supernatural rapidity of the birth and growth of the new Israel.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/66-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of such as this?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
