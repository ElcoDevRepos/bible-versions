It is a common expression in prophetic literature, pointing to a future event determined by God. In the context of Isaiah, "that day" frequently refers to a time of reckoning or fulfillment of God's plans, often associated with both judgment and restoration.<p><b>the splendor of Jacob will fade</b><br>"Jacob" here represents the nation of Israel, as Jacob was the patriarch whose name was changed to Israel. The "splendor" refers to the prosperity, strength, and glory of the nation. The fading of this splendor suggests a decline in Israel's power and influence, likely due to divine judgment. Historically, this can be linked to the Assyrian invasions that led to the downfall of the Northern Kingdom. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and the fat of his body will waste away</b><br>The "fat" symbolizes abundance and prosperity. In ancient cultures, fatness was often associated with wealth and health. The wasting away of the fat indicates a loss of prosperity and vitality, possibly due to external threats or internal corruption. This imagery underscores the severity of the judgment and the complete reversal of fortune for Israel. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual decline, where the richness of faith and obedience is lost. This can be connected to other scriptural warnings about the dangers of complacency and the need for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel.

Israel, having united herself with Syria to resist the Assyrians, will incur a similar fate. Her glory will decay, her population dwindle and almost disappear. Still there will be a few left, who, under the circumstances, will turn to God (ver. 7). But it will be too late for anything like a national recovery; the laud will remain "a desolation" on account of the past sins of its inhabitants (vers. 9-11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glory of Jacob shall be made thin</span>.
