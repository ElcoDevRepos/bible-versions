In ancient times, moths were a common threat to clothing, which was a valuable possession. This metaphor emphasizes the inevitable decay and destruction of those who oppose God's people. The imagery is also found in <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a> and <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>, where earthly treasures are shown to be perishable. The moth represents the silent and gradual process of decay, suggesting that the enemies of God's people will be rendered powerless over time.<p><b>and the worm will eat them like wool</b><br>Similar to the moth, the worm symbolizes decay and destruction. Wool, a common material for clothing in biblical times, was susceptible to being eaten by worms. This imagery reinforces the idea that those who oppose God will face inevitable ruin. The use of both moth and worm highlights the certainty and completeness of this destruction. This phrase echoes the themes found in <a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, where the fate of the wicked is depicted as fleeting and ultimately doomed.<p><b>But My righteousness will last forever</b><br>In contrast to the temporary nature of human opposition, God's righteousness is eternal. This phrase underscores the enduring and unchanging nature of God's moral perfection and justice. The permanence of God's righteousness is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>. This assurance provides comfort to believers, affirming that God's standards and promises remain constant throughout time.<p><b>My salvation through all generations</b><br>God's salvation is depicted as enduring and available to all generations, emphasizing its timeless and universal nature. This promise of salvation is a central theme in the Bible, pointing to God's plan of redemption through Jesus Christ. The continuity of God's salvation is reflected in passages like <a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a> and <a href="/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>, which highlight God's mercy and faithfulness across generations. This assurance of salvation offers hope and encouragement to believers, affirming that God's deliverance is not limited by time or circumstance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

it unravels without warning.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>, &#8220;So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths,&#8221; and reminds us of Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a> that earthly treasures are liable to moth and rust.<p>Takeaway: No human institution, ruler, or cultural trend&#8212;no matter how imposing&#8212;can withstand the silent judgment of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the worm will eat them like wool</b><p>Isaiah doubles the image: if moth larvae ruin finished cloth, worms destroy it at the raw-material stage.<p>&#8226;
