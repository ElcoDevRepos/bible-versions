In the context of <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>, this chapter is part of a prophetic vision of the future glory of Zion. The question suggests a sense of wonder and anticipation about the arrival of people or groups that are unexpected or remarkable. This can be seen as a reference to the gathering of nations and peoples to Jerusalem, fulfilling God's promise of restoration and blessing.<p><b>who fly like clouds,</b><br>The imagery of flying like clouds suggests swiftness and abundance. Clouds often symbolize divine presence and guidance in the Bible, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God led the Israelites by a pillar of cloud. This could imply that the people coming to Zion are being divinely guided or are part of a divine plan. The abundance of clouds also suggests a large number of people, indicating a significant movement or migration towards Zion.<p><b>like doves to their shelters?</b><br>Doves are often symbols of peace and purity in biblical literature. The reference to doves returning to their shelters suggests a natural, instinctive movement towards safety and rest. This can be interpreted as the nations or the people of God returning to a place of peace and security, which is found in the presence of God in Zion. The imagery of doves also connects to the New Testament, where the Holy Spirit is described as descending like a dove at Jesus' baptism, symbolizing peace and the presence of God. This phrase, therefore, can be seen as a prophetic vision of the gathering of God's people in a time of peace and divine fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages of both judgment and hope to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of God's promise and the focal point of the prophecy, representing the future glory and restoration of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentiles who will come to Zion, symbolizing the inclusion of all peoples in God's redemptive plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/doves.htm">Doves</a></b><br>Symbolic of peace and the Spirit of God, often used to represent purity and divine presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/clouds.htm">Clouds</a></b><br>Often symbolize divine presence and guidance, as seen in the Exodus account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gathering_of_nations.htm">The Gathering of Nations</a></b><br><a href="/isaiah/60-8.htm">Isaiah 60:8</a> highlights the prophetic vision of all nations coming to Zion.
