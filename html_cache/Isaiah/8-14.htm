In the context of Isaiah, God Himself is the sanctuary for those who trust in Him. The concept of God as a sanctuary is rooted in the idea of the temple as a holy place where God's presence dwells. This sanctuary is not a physical structure but a spiritual refuge. The imagery of God as a sanctuary is echoed in Psalms, where God is often described as a refuge and fortress (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). This also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sanctuary for believers, providing spiritual safety and salvation.<p><b>but to both houses of Israel a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,</b><br>The "both houses of Israel" refers to the divided kingdoms of Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). The imagery of a "stone of stumbling" and a "rock of offense" suggests something that causes people to fall or be offended. In the historical context, this refers to the people's rejection of God's message and His prophets. This phrase is prophetic, pointing to the rejection of Jesus Christ by the Jewish leaders and people, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32-33</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>). Jesus is the cornerstone, but for those who do not believe, He becomes a stumbling block.<p><b>to the dwellers of Jerusalem a trap and a snare.</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, represents the center of religious and political life. The "trap and a snare" imagery indicates judgment and entrapment due to unbelief and disobedience. Historically, Jerusalem faced numerous sieges and destructions due to its leaders' failure to heed God's warnings. This phrase underscores the consequences of rejecting God's provision and protection. In a broader theological sense, it highlights the danger of rejecting Christ, who is both the cornerstone and the stumbling block, leading to spiritual entrapment for those who do not believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Are the contrasted clauses connected by any common link of imagery? To enter into fellowship with Jehovah, is to enter into the sanctuary. He who stands on the stone which forms the threshold of that sanctuary, has gained an asylum. But to do that requires the clear vision of faith. He who walks blindly (<a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>), without faith, may stumble on that very stone of the threshold, and what was safety and life for others, might for him bring pain and shame. He might be there sorely bruised (<a href="/matthew/21-44.htm" title="And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Matthew 21:44</a>) like the wild animals taken in a trap (synonyms are heaped one upon another to increase the force of the imagery), till a helper came to release him. So, Isaiah says, was Jehovah "to both the houses of Israel" (the phrase is peculiar, and implies a hope of the restored unity of the nation's life) in their self-chosen blindness. So St. Peter says, even the head corner-stone is to those who "stumble at the word, being disobedient" a "stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>).
