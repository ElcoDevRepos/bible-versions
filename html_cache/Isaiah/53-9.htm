In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, being buried with the wicked was considered a disgrace. The expectation was that criminals and those deemed unrighteous would be buried in dishonorable places. This prophecy is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Jesus is crucified between two criminals, indicating His association with the wicked in death (<a href="/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32-33</a>).<p><b>and with a rich man in His death</b><br>Despite the initial assignment of a grave with the wicked, the prophecy takes an unexpected turn. Jesus is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man and a member of the Sanhedrin (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). This fulfills the prophecy and underscores the divine orchestration of events, as Joseph's tomb was new and unused, providing an honorable burial place for Jesus. This also aligns with the cultural significance of burial practices, where a proper burial was a sign of respect and honor.<p><b>although He had done no violence</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the innocence and sinlessness of the suffering servant. In the context of the Hebrew Scriptures, violence often refers to unjust actions or oppression. The servant's lack of violence underscores His righteousness and contrasts with the treatment He receives. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as sinless and without fault (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), highlighting His role as the perfect sacrifice.<p><b>nor was any deceit in His mouth</b><br>The absence of deceit further confirms the servant's integrity and truthfulness. In biblical terms, deceit is associated with sin and falsehood. The servant's purity in speech and action fulfills the requirement for a spotless sacrifice, as seen in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. This characteristic is mirrored in the New Testament portrayal of Jesus, who is described as the truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and whose words are always aligned with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Suffering Servant" prophecy, which Christians traditionally interpret as referring to Jesus Christ.

The verse highlights His flawless life&#8212;no violence, no deceit&#8212;while underscoring the substitutionary nature of His death. History records the precise fulfillment in Jesus of Nazareth, confirming both the accuracy of prophecy and the trustworthiness of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/53.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And he made his grave . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">one </span>(or, <span class= "ital">they</span>)<span class= "ital"> assigned him a grave <span class= "bld">. . .</span></span> The words are often interpreted as fulfilled in our Lord's crucifixion between the two robbers and his burial in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. It has to be noted, however, (1) that this requires an inversion of the clauses; (2) that it introduces a feature scarcely in harmony with the general drift of the description; (3) that the laws of parallelism require us to take the "rich" of one clause as corresponding to the "wicked" of the other, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in the sense of the wrongfully rich, the oppressors, as in <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm" title="They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-16.htm" title="Be not you afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;">Psalm 49:16</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/73-3.htm" title="For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.">Psalm 73:3-5</a>. Men assigned to the Servant not the burial of a saint, with reverence and honour (such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as that of Stephen, <a href="/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>), but that of an unjust oppressor, for whom no man lamented, saying, "Ah lord! Ah my brother! Ah his glory!" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>), and this <span class= "ital">although </span>(not "because") he had done no violence to deserve it. (Comp. <a href="/job/16-17.htm" title="Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.">Job 16:17</a>.) The rendering "because" has been adopted as giving a reason for the honourable burial which, it has been assumed, the words imply. It may be questioned, however, when we remember Isaiah's words as to Shebna (<a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>), whether he would have looked on such a burial as that recorded in the Gospels, clandestine, and with no public lamentation, as an adequate recognition of the holiness of the victim. The point of the last two clauses is that they declare emphatically the absolute rectitude of the sufferer in act, his absolute veracity in speech. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his grave with the wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they assigned him his grave with the wicked.</span> The verb is used impersonally. Those who condemned Christ to be crucified with two malefactors on the common execution-ground - "the place of a skull" - meant his grave to be "with the wicked," with whom it would naturally have been but for the interference of Joseph of Arimathaea. Crucified persons were buried with their crosses near the scene of their crucifixion by the Romans<span class="cmt_word">. And with the rich in his death</span>; or, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">he was</span>) <span class="accented">with a rich one after his death.</span> In the preceding clause, the word translated "the wicked" is plural, but in the present, the word translated "the rich" is singular. The expression translated "in his death" means "when he was dead," "after death" (comp. <a href="/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>). The words have a singularly exact fulfilment in the interment of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>.

The sinlessness of Christ is asserted by himself (<a href="/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>), and forms the main argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews for the superiority of the new covenant over the old (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). It is also witnessed to by St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), by St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), and by St. John (<a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>).
