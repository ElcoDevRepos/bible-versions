The relationship between an ox and its owner was one of mutual dependence and familiarity. The ox, despite being a simple animal, recognizes and responds to the one who provides for it. This imagery highlights the natural order and instinctual loyalty found even in animals, which serves as a stark contrast to the behavior of Israel. The use of the ox here underscores the expectation of recognition and gratitude towards one's provider, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>, which reminds believers of their identity as God's people.<p><b>and the donkey its master&#8217;s manger</b><br>The donkey, another common animal in biblical times, was known for its stubbornness yet also for its reliability in carrying burdens. The mention of the donkey recognizing its master's manger emphasizes the idea of knowing one's source of sustenance and care. The manger, a feeding trough, symbolizes provision and sustenance. This imagery is later echoed in the New Testament with the birth of Jesus, who was laid in a manger (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>), symbolizing God's provision for humanity. The donkey's recognition of its master's manger further illustrates the expected response of gratitude and acknowledgment of one's provider.<p><b>but Israel does not know</b><br>Here, the prophet Isaiah contrasts the natural recognition of animals with the spiritual ignorance of Israel. Despite being chosen and blessed by God, Israel fails to acknowledge Him as their provider and sustainer. This lack of knowledge is not intellectual but relational and spiritual, indicating a failure to recognize God's role in their lives. This theme of Israel's spiritual blindness and forgetfulness is recurrent in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The phrase serves as a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>My people do not understand.</b><br>The term "My people" signifies a personal and covenantal relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the depth of their betrayal. The lack of understanding is not merely cognitive but moral and spiritual, reflecting a failure to live according to God's laws and purposes. This phrase underscores the theme of divine disappointment and the call for Israel to return to a right relationship with God. The concept of understanding in the biblical sense often involves wisdom and discernment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. This call to understanding is a call to return to a life aligned with God's will and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The verse calls every reader to surpass mere instinct, responding gratefully and intelligently to the One who feeds, shelters, and redeems (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The ox knoweth his owner </span>. . .--As in <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm" title="Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.">1Samuel 12:3</a>, the ox and the ass rather than, as with us, the horse and the dog, are the representative instances of the relation of domesticated animals to man. These know that relation, and act according to it; but Israel did not, or rather would not, know. So Jeremiah dwells, turning to a different region of animal life, on the instinct which leads the stork, the swallow, and the crane to fulfil the law of their being (<a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm" title="Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:7</a>), while Israel "knew not"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>did not acknowledge--the law of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ox... the ass.</span> The ox and the ass are probably selected as the least intelligent of domesticated animals (so Jerome, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and Gesenius). Yet even they recognize their owner or master. Jeremiah contrasts the brutish stupidity of Israel with the wise instinct of animals that have not been domesticated, as the stork, the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow (<a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Israel doth not know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does not acknowledge its Master and Owner, pays him no respect, does not recognize him as either Owner or Master. <span class="cmt_word">My people.</span> Compare the formula, so frequent in Exodus, "Let <span class="accented">my people</span> go" (Exodus 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, etc.).
