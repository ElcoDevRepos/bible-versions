In ancient Israel, agriculture was a central part of life, and the audience would understand the futility of plowing without end. The plowman represents God, who knows when to plow and when to plant, symbolizing His perfect timing in judgment and restoration. This can be connected to <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. The plowman&#8217;s work is not endless; it is purposeful, just as God's actions are intentional and aimed at bringing about His divine plan.<p><b>Does he continuously loosen and harrow the soil?</b><br>Loosening and harrowing the soil are preparatory steps for planting, emphasizing the necessity of preparation before growth. In the context of Isaiah, this can be seen as a metaphor for God's preparation of His people through discipline and teaching. The process of harrowing, which breaks up the soil, can be likened to the trials and tribulations that refine and prepare believers for spiritual growth. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>, where discipline is described as painful yet yielding the peaceful fruit of righteousness. The question implies that just as a farmer does not endlessly prepare the soil, God&#8217;s discipline is not without end but is designed to lead to a fruitful outcome.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah and Israel.
