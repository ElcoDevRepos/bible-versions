Historically, this period was marked by Israel's spiritual decline and idolatry, leading to a lack of true spiritual leadership. The absence of a righteous person highlights the nation's failure to uphold God's covenant. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, where God searches for someone to stand in the gap but finds none.<p><b>there is no counselor among them;</b><br>The term "counselor" refers to someone who provides wisdom and guidance, often associated with leadership roles. In the context of ancient Israel, counselors were expected to offer advice based on God's law. The absence of such figures indicates a spiritual void and a reliance on false prophets and idols. This lack of true counsel is contrasted with the wisdom of Christ, who is called the "Wonderful Counselor" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of divine wisdom in Jesus.<p><b>when I ask them, they have nothing to say.</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of seeking wisdom from those who are spiritually blind and deaf. It reflects the silence of idols and false prophets, who cannot provide true answers or guidance. This silence is a judgment against the people for turning away from God. In contrast, the New Testament presents Jesus as the Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>), who speaks truth and life, fulfilling the role of the ultimate prophet and teacher.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
