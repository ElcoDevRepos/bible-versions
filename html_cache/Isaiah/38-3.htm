The phrase "walked before You" suggests a life lived in conscious awareness of God's presence, reminiscent of Enoch and Noah, who also "walked with God" (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24, 6</a>:9). Hezekiah's claim of faithfulness and wholehearted devotion highlights the biblical theme of integrity and sincerity in one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart. The appeal to having done "what is good" aligns with the Deuteronomic history, where kings are often evaluated based on their adherence to God's laws (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>). This reflects the cultural and religious expectation of a king to lead by example in righteousness.<p><b>And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</b><br>Hezekiah's tears indicate the depth of his distress and the sincerity of his prayer. In the ancient Near Eastern context, weeping was a common expression of grief and earnest supplication. The mention of weeping also connects to other biblical figures who expressed their anguish through tears, such as David (<a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>). This emotional response underscores the human aspect of biblical characters, making them relatable to readers. Hezekiah's weeping can also be seen as a type of Christ, who wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>) and at Lazarus's tomb (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), showing compassion and empathy. The narrative context of Hezekiah's illness and impending death (<a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38:1</a>) adds urgency to his prayer, illustrating the biblical principle that God hears the cries of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.

Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). Peter&#8217;s later weeping (<a href="/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>) shows such tears can precede restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s plea in <a href="/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a> is a heartfelt covenant appeal. He reminds the LORD of a life lived openly before Him&#8212;faithful, wholehearted, and marked by good works. Far from presumption, this prayer is a humble request that God remember His own promises to bless obedience. Hezekiah&#8217;s bitter tears underline the sincerity of his faith, and God&#8217;s swift, compassionate response proves that He hears and honors the contrite who walk in integrity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Remember now, O Lord.</span>--Devout as the prayer is, there is a tone of self-satisfaction in it which contrasts with David's prayer (<a href="/context/psalms/51-1.htm" title="Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving kindness: according to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.">Psalm 51:1-3</a>). He rests on what he has done in the way of religious reformation, and practically asks what he has done that he should be cut off by an untimely death. The tears may probably have been less egotistic than the words, and, therefore, were more prevailing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember now, O Lord</span>. Hezekiah was in the full vigour of life - thirty-nine years old only. He had probably as yet no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him, was but twelve (<a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/33-1.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1</a>) when Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four. It was a grievous thing to a Jew to leave no male offspring: it was viewed as a mark of the Divine displeasure to be cut off in the midst of one's days (<a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>; <a href="/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15, 16</a>: <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). Hezekiah asked himself - Had he deserved such a sentence? He thought that he had not. He knew that, with whatever shortcomings, he had endeavoured to serve God, had trusted in him (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>), cleaved to him (<a href="/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>), "departed not from following him, but kept his commandments" (<a href="/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>) He therefore ventured upon an expostulation and an earnest prayer; and God was pleased to hear the prayer and to grant it. <span class="cmt_word">I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart</span>. Compare the unbiased testimony of the authors of Kings and Chronicles (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-2.htm">2 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-20.htm">2 Chronicles 31:20, 21</a>). Under the old dispensation, there was nothing to prevent men from pleading their righteousness before God (comp. <a href="/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4-40</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>-2; 18:20-24; 26:1-8, etc.). Hezekiah, however, does not really regard himself as sinless (comp. ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore</span>. In the East feelings are but little restrained. Joy shows itself in laughter and shouting, grief in tears and shrill cries. Xerxes wept when he thought of the shortness of human life (Herod., 7:46); the Persians rent the air with load cries at the funeral of Masistius (ibid., 9:24); on the news of the defeat at Salamis all Susa "cried aloud, and wept and wailed without stint" (ibid., 8:99). So David wept for Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>) and again for Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/19-1.htm">2 Samuel 19:1</a>); Joash wept when he heard the words of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>); Nehemiah wept at the desolation of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>); the ambassadors of Hezekiah, when disappointed of the object of their embassy, "wept bitterly" (<a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). No king in the East puts himself under any restraint, if he has an inclination for either tears or laughter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/38-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Please,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;n&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_577.htm">Strong's 577: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah, now!
