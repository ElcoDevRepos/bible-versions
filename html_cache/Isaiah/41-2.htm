Historically, this is often understood to refer to Cyrus the Great of Persia, who played a pivotal role in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. The east, in biblical geography, typically refers to regions such as Persia and Media. This action underscores God's control over history and nations, using even foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and called him to his feet in righteousness?</b><br>The calling "in righteousness" suggests that this leader's rise is part of God's righteous plan, aligning with His covenant promises and justice. This reflects the biblical theme that God uses rulers to fulfill His divine purposes, even if they are unaware of their role in His plan. The righteousness here is not necessarily the personal righteousness of the leader but the righteous purposes of God being fulfilled through him.<p><b>He hands nations over to him</b><br>This indicates God's authority in granting power and victory to this leader over other nations. It reflects the biblical principle that God is the ultimate ruler over all kingdoms and can give dominion to whomever He chooses. This is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons and deposes kings.<p><b>and subdues kings before him.</b><br>The subduing of kings highlights the military and political success granted to this leader by God. Historically, Cyrus's conquests were swift and effective, leading to the expansion of the Persian Empire. This aligns with the biblical narrative of God using leaders to execute His judgment and deliverance.<p><b>He turns them to dust with his sword,</b><br>This imagery of turning enemies to dust signifies total defeat and destruction. The sword is a common biblical symbol of warfare and judgment. This phrase emphasizes the completeness of the victory granted by God, reminiscent of other biblical victories where enemies are utterly vanquished, such as in Joshua's conquests.<p><b>to windblown chaff with his bow.</b><br>The comparison to windblown chaff suggests the ease and swiftness of the victory. Chaff is the light, worthless husk separated from grain, easily carried away by the wind. This metaphor is used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, to describe the fate of the wicked. It underscores the futility of resisting God's appointed leader and the transient nature of human power against divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_from_the_east.htm">The One from the East</a></b><br>Traditionally interpreted as Cyrus the Great, the Persian king who conquered Babylon and allowed the Israelites to return to Jerusalem.

He is the One who stirs up a leader from the eastern lands. Historically, the most natural fit is Cyrus of Persia, whom Isaiah later names outright (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> &#8211; 45:1).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows God repeatedly raising deliverers from unexpected places&#8212;think of Abraham leaving Ur (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the judges God &#8220;raised up&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By posing the question, the Lord underscores that no human ambition or military genius originates in a vacuum; every ruler&#8217;s rise is orchestrated by Him (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called him to his feet in righteousness?</b><p>The phrase stresses purpose: God not only prompts the leader&#8217;s rise but also &#8220;calls him to his feet&#8221; to carry out a righteous mission.<p>&#8226; For Cyrus, that mission was to topple oppressive empires and ultimately release God&#8217;s exiled people (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22-23</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In righteousness&#8221; reminds us that even a pagan king can serve divine justice when God directs his path (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The righteousness here is objective&#8212;God&#8217;s own standard&#8212;not the personal piety of Cyrus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He hands nations over to him</b><p>The prophet now describes the sweeping victories Cyrus will enjoy because God hands nations to him.<p>&#8226; History records Persia&#8217;s rapid conquests of Media, Lydia, and Babylon. Isaiah foretells this roughly 150 years in advance, confirming the reliability of prophetic Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording echoes how God &#8220;gave&#8221; Canaan to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>), reinforcing that all land transfers ultimately rest in His authority (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and subdues kings before him</b><p>Not only territories but monarchs themselves fall.

The passage assures believers that world events, no matter how turbulent, unfold under the precise direction of the Lord who both predicts and performs His purposes for the good of His people and the glory of His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Who raised up . . .</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">Who hath raised up from the East the man whom Righteousness calls </span>(or, <span class= "ital">whom He calls in righteousness</span>)<span class= "ital"> to tread in His steps. </span>(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm" title="I will go before you, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:">Isaiah 45:2</a>.)

"Righteousness called him to his foot" when God, the Righteous One, made him his minister, and gave him a certain task to perform (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gave the nations before him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">gives</span>, or <span class="accented">will give.</span> (On the rapid conquests of Cyrus, see Herod., 1:75-191; and comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 354-377.) That he was God's instrument must be admitted by all who allow that the course of history is determined by a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Made him rule over kings</span>. Mr. Cheyne translates, "makes him trample upon kings," which seems to give the true sense. It was certainly not the general policy of Cyrus to establish under him a number of subject kings, but rather to rule the conquered countries by means of Persian or Median governors (see Herod., 1:153, 156; 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 166) <span class="cmt_word">He gave them as the dust to his sword</span>, etc.; or, according to some, <span class="accented">he maketh their sword as dust</span>, <span class="accented">and their bow as driven stubble.</span> The result is the same, whichever we regard as the true construction. The prophecy tells of the ease and completeness with which Cyrus vanquished his enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/41-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has aroused</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the one from the east</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;miz&#183;r&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
