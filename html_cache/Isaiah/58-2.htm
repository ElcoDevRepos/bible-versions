In the context of ancient Israel, seeking God was often associated with prayer, fasting, and temple worship. However, the sincerity of their seeking is questioned, as it is more ritualistic than heartfelt. This reflects a common theme in the prophetic books where God desires genuine devotion over mere ritual (see <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>).<p><b>and delight to know My ways</b><br>The people express a desire to understand God's laws and commandments. This delight suggests an intellectual or superficial interest rather than a deep, transformative commitment. The Torah, particularly the books of Moses, outlines God's ways, and the Israelites were expected to live by these statutes. However, their actions often contradicted their professed delight, as seen in their social injustices.<p><b>like a nation that does what is right</b><br>This phrase implies a comparison between the people's self-perception and their actual behavior. They see themselves as righteous, akin to a nation that follows God's commandments. Historically, Israel was chosen to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), but their actions frequently fell short of this calling. The prophets often called out this discrepancy between self-perception and reality.<p><b>and does not forsake the justice of their God</b><br>Justice is a central theme in the Old Testament, reflecting God's character and expectations for His people. The Israelites were commanded to uphold justice, especially for the marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>). However, the prophets, including Isaiah, frequently rebuked them for neglecting justice, indicating a failure to live up to their covenantal responsibilities.<p><b>They ask Me for righteous judgments</b><br>The people seek God's guidance and decisions, possibly through prayer or consultation with prophets. This request for righteous judgments suggests a desire for divine intervention in their affairs. However, their understanding of righteousness is often skewed, as they fail to apply God's standards to their own lives, leading to a disconnect between their requests and their actions.<p><b>they delight in the nearness of God</b><br>This phrase indicates a superficial pleasure in the presence of God, likely through religious ceremonies and temple worship. The nearness of God was a significant aspect of Israel's identity, symbolized by the Ark of the Covenant and the temple. Yet, true nearness to God requires obedience and a heart aligned with His will, which the people lacked. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes internal transformation over external observance (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

We have there exactly the same representation of a people honouring God with their lips, but whose hearts are far from him - zealous in all the outward forms of religion, even making "many prayers" (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>), but yet altogether an offence to God. They are not conscious hypocrites - quite the reverse; they are bent on "doing righteousness," on not forsaking God's ordinance, on continually "approaching" him; but they are wholly without a proper sense of what religion is - they make it a matter of outward observance, and do not understand that it consists in the devotion of the heart. <span class="cmt_word">That did righteousness,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and forsook not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that hath done righteousness</span>, <span class="accented">and hath not forsaken.</span> The righteousness is, of course, forensic legal righteousness-the offering of the appointed sacrifices, the abstaining from unclean meats, the avoidance of external defilement, the payment of vows, the observance of the one appointed fast, and the like. They ask of me the ordinances of justice. Either "they claim at God's hands righteous judgments on their enemies" (Delitzsch); or "they demand of God a fidelity to his covenant engagements correspondent to their own (assumed) fidelity to theirs." They take delight in approaching to God. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Calvin, Vitringa, and Kay.
