In ancient Israel, appearing before God was a significant act, often associated with festivals and sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>). The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This approach was meant to be reverent and sincere, reflecting a heart aligned with God's will.<p><b>who has required this of you&#8212;</b><br>Here, God questions the people's motives and the authenticity of their worship. The rhetorical question suggests that their actions are not in line with what God truly desires. This echoes the prophetic theme that God values obedience and righteousness over ritualistic practices (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The prophets often called out empty religious practices that lacked genuine devotion and ethical living.<p><b>this trampling of My courts?</b><br>The term "trampling" conveys a sense of disrespect and irreverence. The courts refer to the temple courts, where worshippers gathered. This imagery suggests that the people are treating sacred spaces with contempt, reducing worship to mere ritual without heartfelt devotion. This critique aligns with other prophetic messages that condemn superficial worship (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-11</a>). The temple, a type of Christ as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity, is being dishonored by insincere worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

He asks, &#8220;Who told you that empty ritual satisfies Me?&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The question echoes Samuel&#8217;s rebuke to Saul: &#8220;Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings&#8230;? To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; By interrogating His people, the Lord exposes self-made religion&#8212;the kind that keeps the calendar yet ignores the covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; True requirement remains unchanged: &#8220;Love the LORD your God with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>), not merely with external compliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This trampling of My courts</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Trampling&#8221; conveys noisy, careless footsteps crowding holy ground. What should be reverent has become destructive, like cattle milling about (<a href="/malachi/1-10.htm">Malachi 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later addresses the same corruption when He clears the temple: &#8220;My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The courts belong to God&#8212;&#8220;My courts&#8221;&#8212;so irreverent worship is personal offense, not procedural error (<a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord therefore rejects worship that treads on His holiness while hearts remain unrepentant (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a> confronts worshipers who assume that simply showing up in the temple pleases God. He reminds them they stand before Him, not a ritual. He challenges the notion that He ever asked for lifeless routine, exposing their gatherings as thoughtless trampling of sacred space. The verse calls believers to approach God with obedient hearts, reverence, and genuine devotion, for only sincere worship honors the One whose courts we enter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">When ye come to appear before me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">before my face. </span>This is the meaning given by the present Hebrew text, and it is, of course, adequate. The Syriac version and some modern scholars (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Cheyne) adopt a reading which gives <span class= "ital">to see my face. </span>In either case the implied thought is that the worshippers believed they came into the more immediate presence of Jehovah when, they entered the Temple courts. To "appear before God" was the normal phrase for visiting the Temple at the three great Feasts and other solemn occasions (<a href="/exodus/34-23.htm" title="Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.">Exodus 34:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm" title="My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is your God?">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye come to appear before me.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "to see my face;" but most other commentators (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Ewald, Kay) regard the phrase used as equivalent to that employed in <a href="/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-23.htm">Exodus 34:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; and the passage as referring to that attendance in the temple at the three great annual festivals, which was required of all adult male Israelites.
