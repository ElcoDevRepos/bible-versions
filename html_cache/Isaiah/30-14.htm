The potter's jar is often used in Scripture to represent the nation of Israel or individuals (<a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>). The breaking of the jar signifies judgment and destruction, reflecting God's response to Israel's rebellion and reliance on foreign alliances instead of trusting Him. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic tradition of using everyday objects to convey divine messages.<p><b>Shattered so that no fragment can be found</b><br>The complete shattering of the jar indicates total destruction, leaving nothing salvageable. This reflects the severity of God's judgment on those who refuse to heed His warnings. The idea of being shattered beyond repair is echoed in <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, where the rebellious are broken with a rod of iron. It underscores the finality of divine judgment and the futility of resisting God's will.<p><b>Not a shard will be found in the dust</b><br>The absence of even a small shard emphasizes the thoroughness of the destruction. In ancient times, pottery shards were often repurposed for various uses, but here, the destruction is so complete that nothing remains. This can be seen as a metaphor for the complete removal of sin and rebellion, leaving no trace behind. It also highlights the seriousness of turning away from God, as seen in the warnings throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>Large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth</b><br>This phrase illustrates the practical uses of pottery shards in daily life, such as handling hot coals. The inability to find a shard for such a basic task underscores the totality of the judgment. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the loss of God's protection and provision, as seen in the curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>Or to skim the water from a cistern</b><br>Cisterns were vital for water storage in the arid climate of ancient Israel. The inability to find a shard to draw water signifies a loss of sustenance and life. Water is often symbolic of life and spiritual nourishment in Scripture (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). This phrase highlights the spiritual barrenness that results from rejecting God, as well as the physical consequences of such rebellion. It serves as a call to repentance and reliance on God for true sustenance and life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

The phrase pictures the suddenness of God&#8217;s judgment&#8212;nothing gradual, no slow cracking, but an abrupt snap. Think of how the Philistines&#8217; idol Dagon fell and &#8220;his head and hands were broken off&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>). When God decrees a fall, it happens decisively (see <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a potter&#8217;s jar</b><p>A clay jar is ordinary, fragile, and easily replaced. By choosing this image, Isaiah stresses how little security Judah&#8217;s plans actually possess. Jeremiah used the same object lesson, smashing a pot before the elders of Jerusalem to illustrate coming ruin (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>). The potter may shape beautiful vessels, but once fired, a jar has no flexibility. In the same way, Judah&#8217;s obstinate refusal to trust the Lord left them brittle, ready to break (compare <a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shattered so that no fragment can be found</b><p>Not just cracked&#8212;pulverized. The destruction will be so thorough that even the smallest recognizable piece disappears. <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> foretells Messiah &#8220;shattering them like pottery,&#8221; and <a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a> describes the smashed statue turning to chaff the wind carries away. God&#8217;s judgment eliminates every illusion of strength; nothing useful or salvageable remains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not a shard large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth or to skim the water from a cistern</b><p>Ancient households reused broken pottery for simple tasks: lifting a few embers or ladling a little water. Isaiah says Judah will be left without even that minimal utility. Their political schemes with Egypt will not produce one practical benefit (compare <a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5-6</a>). The image also recalls Jesus&#8217; warning that tasteless salt &#8220;is no longer good for anything&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>). When people reject God&#8217;s help, they forfeit all real usefulness and protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a> pictures Judah&#8217;s misplaced confidence crushed like a clay pot&#8212;swiftly, completely, and irreversibly. Every shard of self-reliance is ground to dust, leaving nothing that can serve even the humblest purpose. The verse calls us to place absolute trust in the Lord alone, for only He provides security that will not break.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">As the breaking of the potters' vessel . . .</span> <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> had given currency to the figure.

The schemes of the intriguers were to be not crushed only but pulverised.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces</span>. Isaiah is fond of mixed metaphors, and of superseding one metaphor by another. From comparing Judah's fall and ruin to the shattering of a lofty wall, he suddenly turns to a comparison of it with the breaking to pieces of an earthen pitcher. Judah shall be so broken as when the pitcher is crushed into minute fragments, so that there is no piece large enough to convey a coal from one fire for the lighting of another, or to be of even the least use for drawing water from a well. A complete dissolution of the political fabric is foreshadowed, such as did not actually take effect till the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/30-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It will break</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1440;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
