Historically, Jerusalem was the site of the Temple, the heart of Jewish worship, and the city where God chose to place His name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). The rejoicing signifies a future restoration and peace, contrasting with past judgments. This aligns with prophecies of a new Jerusalem, a place of divine presence and joy (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-4</a>).<p><b>and take delight in My people.</b><br>God's delight in His people underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing His enduring love and faithfulness despite their past disobedience. This delight is a fulfillment of promises made throughout the Old Testament, where God assures His people of restoration and blessing (<a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where believers in Christ are seen as God's people, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>).<p><b>The sounds of weeping and crying will no longer be heard in her.</b><br>This promise of the cessation of sorrow and pain points to a future era of peace and restoration. In the historical context, Jerusalem had experienced much suffering due to invasions and exile. The absence of weeping signifies a reversal of these conditions, aligning with prophetic visions of a time when God will wipe away every tear (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).

The reasons there given are satisfactory: "There shall be no more death, neither sorrow... neither shall there be any more pain." But these reasons scarcely apply here. For Isaiah's "new Jerusalem" is not without death (ver. 20), nor without sorrow, since it is not without sin (ver. 20), nor, as there is death there, is it without pain. Isaiah's picture, according to Delitzsch, represents the millennial state, not the final condition of the redeemed; but this trait - the absence of <span class="accented">all</span> weeping - can only be literally true of the final state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/65-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will rejoice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
