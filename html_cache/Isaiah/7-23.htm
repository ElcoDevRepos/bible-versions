In the context of <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, "that day" points to a future period when God's warnings through the prophet Isaiah would come to pass. It is a reminder of the certainty of God's word and His control over historical events. This phrase often signifies a time of divine intervention or significant change, as seen in other prophetic books like Joel and Zephaniah.<p><b>in every place that had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver</b><br>This imagery highlights the prosperity and wealth of the land before judgment. A vineyard with a thousand vines would be considered highly valuable, indicating a place of abundance and economic significance. The mention of "a thousand shekels of silver" underscores the substantial worth of these vineyards, reflecting the economic prosperity of Judah before the impending devastation. This can be compared to the blessings of the land described in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, where the abundance of the Promised Land is emphasized.<p><b>only briers and thorns will be found</b><br>This phrase signifies desolation and the consequences of turning away from God. Briers and thorns are often used in Scripture to symbolize judgment and curse, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, where thorns and thistles are part of the curse on the ground after the Fall. The transformation from a fruitful vineyard to a place overrun with briers and thorns illustrates the reversal of fortune due to disobedience and the resulting divine judgment. This imagery is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus uses the metaphor of thorns to describe the cares of the world that choke the word, making it unfruitful (<a href="/mark/4-18.htm">Mark 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

There, however, the sum represents the annual produce of the vineyard, here the rent of the vines at a shekel each, a high rent apparently, and indicating a choice quality of vine. The costly vineyards of the hills of Judah should be left to run wild without a keeper (<a href="/isaiah/5-10.htm" title="Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.">Isaiah 5:10</a>), and thorns and briers would rapidly cover it. "Silverling" was an old English word for any silver coin, and appears in Tyndale's version of <a href="/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>, and Coverdale's of <a href="/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4</a>; <a href="/judges/16-5.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.">Judges 16:5</a>; here it stands for "shekel." The modern rent is said to be a piastre (2&#172;d.) for each vine; the shekel was worth 2s. 3 d.

By "silverlings" our translators mean "pieces of silver," probably shekels. "A thousand vines at a thousand shekels" may mean either a thousand vines worth that amount, or a thousand vines rented at that sum annually (comp. <a href="/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>). The latter would point to vineyards of unusual goodness, since the shekel is <span class="accented">at least</span> eighteen pence, and the present rent of a vineyard in Palestine is at the rate of a piastre for each vine, or 2&frac12;d. The general meaning would seem to be that not even the best vineyards would be cultivated, but would lie waste, and grow only "briers and thorns." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/7-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And on that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
