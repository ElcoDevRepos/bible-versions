Cush was known for its military strength and wealth, making it an attractive ally for smaller nations. In the biblical context, Israel and Judah often sought alliances with powerful neighbors like Cush to protect themselves from larger empires such as Assyria. This reliance on human power rather than divine guidance is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the futility of trusting in worldly powers over God. The historical context shows that Cush was a significant power during the 8th century BC, often involved in the politics of the Near East.<p><b>and Egypt their boast</b><br>Egypt, like Cush, was a powerful nation with a rich history and formidable military. The Israelites often looked to Egypt for support against threats from the north, particularly from Assyria. Boasting in Egypt implies a sense of pride and confidence in their alliance, believing that Egypt's strength could save them. However, the Bible frequently warns against such alliances, emphasizing that true security comes from God alone. This is evident in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, which cautions against relying on Egypt for help. Historically, Egypt was a dominant force in the region, but its power was waning during Isaiah's time, making reliance on it even more precarious.<p><b>will be dismayed and ashamed</b><br>The outcome of relying on Cush and Egypt is dismay and shame, indicating the failure of these alliances to provide the expected protection and support. This serves as a prophetic warning to the Israelites that their trust in human powers will lead to disappointment. The dismay and shame reflect the broader biblical theme of the consequences of forsaking God for worldly solutions. This phrase also connects to the prophetic nature of Isaiah's ministry, where he often foretold the downfall of nations that opposed God's will. Theologically, this underscores the importance of faith in God rather than in human strength, a principle that resonates throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located in what is now Sudan, often associated with strength and military prowess.

They looked at its distance, military might, and rumored invincibility and said, &#8220;That nation will rescue us.&#8221; Yet Scripture consistently warns against leaning on human strength. &#8220;Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>); &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>). By highlighting Cush first, the prophet reminds us that even the most exotic, far-reaching alliances cannot replace confident trust in the Lord (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Egypt their boast</b><p>&#8226; Egypt was the regional superpower, famed for chariots and strategic wealth. Judah&#8217;s politicians boasted, &#8220;With Egypt beside us, Assyria can&#8217;t touch us&#8221; (see <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>; 36:6). Boasting reveals the heart&#8217;s allegiance; when Egypt&#8212;not God&#8212;fills the mouth with praise, spiritual adultery is exposed (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Paul later echoes this principle: &#8220;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>). Earthly alliances that eclipse God&#8217;s glory set people up for devastation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be dismayed and ashamed</b><p>&#8226; The outcome of misplaced confidence is shock and humiliation. When Assyria swept through, Cush and Egypt proved powerless, and those who trusted them &#8220;turned back in utter shame&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>). God had promised that idols and false refuges would fail: &#8220;All the makers of idols will depart together in disgrace&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>). Contrast the believer&#8217;s hope: &#8220;No one who hopes in You will ever be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>). The verse thus delivers both warning and encouragement&#8212;rely on God and avoid the disgrace reserved for those who trade divine security for human props.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a> teaches that any nation, strategy, or relationship we elevate above the Lord will ultimately collapse and humiliate us.
