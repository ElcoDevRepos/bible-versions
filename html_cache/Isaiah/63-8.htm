It reflects God's intention and decision-making process. In the context of Isaiah, God often speaks directly to His people, revealing His plans and purposes. This divine speech underscores the authority and sovereignty of God in the lives of the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;They are surely My people,</b><br>This declaration highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The term "My people" is significant throughout the Old Testament, denoting a special, chosen status. This phrase echoes God's promise to Abraham and the patriarchs, where He established Israel as His own nation (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). It also reflects the intimate relationship God desires with His people, akin to a familial bond.<p><b>sons who will not be disloyal.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the term "sons" signifies a familial relationship, suggesting both privilege and responsibility. The expectation of loyalty is rooted in the covenant, where Israel is called to faithfulness to God. Historically, Israel's disloyalty is a recurring theme, leading to periods of judgment and exile. This phrase can be seen as an ideal expectation, contrasting with Israel's frequent rebellion. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as children of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><b>So He became their Savior.</b><br>This statement reveals God's response to His people's identity and need. Despite Israel's failures, God acts as their Savior, delivering them from oppression and sin. This role of God as Savior is a central theme in the Bible, culminating in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The concept of salvation here is both physical and spiritual, pointing to God's ultimate plan of redemption through Christ, who is the fulfillment of the prophetic hope for a Savior (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "My people," indicating the nation chosen by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Israelites, highlighting their relationship with God as His children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/savior.htm">Savior</a></b><br>Refers to God&#8217;s role in delivering and redeeming His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God&#8217;s Faithfulness</a></b><br>God identifies His people as His own, showing His commitment and faithfulness despite their past disloyalties.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_as_god's_children.htm">Identity as God&#8217;s Children</a></b><br>Believers today are called to live as children of God, reflecting His character and values in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_savior.htm">Role of the Savior</a></b><br>God&#8217;s role as Savior is central to His relationship with His people, both in the Old Testament and through Christ in the New Testament.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_loyalty.htm">Call to Loyalty</a></b><br>Just as God expected loyalty from Israel, He calls believers to a life of faithfulness and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_and_relationship.htm">Redemption and Relationship</a></b><br>The verse highlights the redemptive relationship God desires with His people, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_63_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 63:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_63_8_God_s_faithfulness_proof.htm">How does Isaiah 63:8 affirm God's faithfulness to His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_surely_My_people_reveal.htm">What does "surely they are My people" reveal about God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_God_s_faithfulness_daily.htm">How can we emulate God's faithfulness in our daily interactions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_63_8_to_God_s_covenant_text.htm">Connect Isaiah 63:8 with another scripture emphasizing God's covenant with His people.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Isaiah_63_8_on_trusting_God.htm">How does understanding God's faithfulness in Isaiah 63:8 impact your trust in Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_63_8_on_God_s_bond_with_His_people.htm">What does Isaiah 63:8 reveal about God's relationship with His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_is_God_s_faithfulness_in_Isaiah_63_8.htm">How does Isaiah 63:8 define the concept of God's faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_63_8_test_divine_trust.htm">In what ways does Isaiah 63:8 challenge our understanding of divine trust?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_63.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 63?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_were_the_edomites.htm">Who were the ancient people known as Edomites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_the_trinity.htm">What is the Bible's teaching on the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_constitutes_the_mystery_of_faith.htm">What constitutes the mystery of faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_god_our_father.htm">Is God our Father?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 63:8 Mean</div><b>For He said</b><p>&#8226; This opening phrase anchors the verse in the direct speech of God.

His words flow from that same steadfast love (<a href="/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By speaking first, God reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that redemption begins with His decision, not human effort (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are surely My people</b><p>&#8226; God claims Israel as &#8220;My people,&#8221; echoing His covenant declaration in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>.<p>&#8226; The adverb &#8220;surely&#8221; underscores certainty; the Lord&#8217;s choice is not tentative but settled (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Possession implies protection: &#8220;You are Mine&#8221; also means &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, this language anticipates the church&#8217;s identity as &#8220;a people for His own possession&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sons who will not be disloyal</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sons&#8221; speaks of familial intimacy.

God&#8217;s love aims to produce obedience, not apathy (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Sadly, Israel&#8217;s history shows repeated unfaithfulness (<a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>). Isaiah records the ideal God intended, underlining how sin makes grace necessary (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The heavenly Father still desires loyal sons and daughters, empowered now by the Spirit to walk in newness of life (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So He became their Savior</b><p>&#8226; Because God claimed them and desired their loyalty, He personally intervened as &#8220;Savior&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>).<p>&#8226; In Isaiah&#8217;s context, this included past deliverances like the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>) and foretold the greater salvation accomplished by the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse foreshadows Christ: &#8220;Today in the city of David a Savior has been born to you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>). Jesus fulfills God&#8217;s saving role once and for all (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation is therefore relational&#8212;rooted in God&#8217;s ownership of a people&#8212;and transformational, rescuing them from sin to faithfulness (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a> reveals a fourfold movement of grace: God speaks, claims a people, expects loyal sonship, and acts as their Savior.
