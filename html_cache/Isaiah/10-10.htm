Historically, this refers to the Assyrian Empire's expansion under kings like Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II, who conquered various nations known for their idolatry. Theologically, it underscores God's intolerance of idolatry, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The "hand" symbolizes divine intervention and authority, often used in scripture to denote God's active role in human affairs (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>).<p><b>whose images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria</b><br>This highlights the extent of idolatry in the conquered kingdoms, suggesting their practices were even more egregious than those found in Jerusalem and Samaria. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, and Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, both struggled with idolatry, despite being chosen by God. The comparison indicates the severity of the idolatry in these foreign nations. This phrase also serves as a warning to Israel and Judah about the consequences of turning away from God. The reference to "images" connects to the biblical prohibition against graven images (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>) and the repeated calls for Israel to remain faithful to Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire during the time of Isaiah, known for its military prowess and conquests.

It is, however, quite in character with the Assyrian inscriptions that Sargon should ascribe his victories to Asshur as the Supreme God, before whose sovereignty all local deities were compelled to bow. To the Assyrian king the name of Jehovah would represent a deity whose power was to be measured by the greatness of the nation that worshipped Him, and inferior, therefore, to the gods of Carchemish or Hamath. The worship of Baal, Moloch, and other deities, in both Israel and Judah, had of course tended to strengthen this estimate. (Comp. Rabshakeh's language in <a href="/context/isaiah/36-18.htm" title="Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?">Isaiah 36:18-19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols.</span> "Found" here means "reached," "punished... subjugated." It is quite in accordance with Assyrian ideas that the conquered countries should be called "kingdoms of the idols" (literally, "no gods"). The Assyrian monarchs regarded their own gods as alone really deserving of the name, and made war very much with the object of proving the superiority of their deities over those of their neighbors. Hence their practice of carrying off the idols from the various cities which they conquered, or else of inscribing on them "the praises of Asshur." <span class="cmt_word">And whose graven images</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their graven images</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Did excel</span>. In preciousness of material or in workmanship, or both. The Assyrians went near to identifying the idols with the gods themselves. <span class="cmt_word">Those of Jerusalem and of Samaria</span>. The chief Samaritan idols were the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; but, in addition to these, "images and groves were set up in every high hill and under every green tree" (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>), images of Baal, and Ashtoreth, and perhaps Beltis, and Chemosh, and Moloch. Even in Judah and in Jerusalem itself there were idols. Ahaz "made molten images for Baalim" (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>). The brazen serpent was worshipped as an idol at Jerusalem until Hezekiah destroyed it; and probably, even after the reformation of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), many Jews retained privately the images, which he required them to destroy (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). Isaiah had already declared, speaking of Judah rather than of Israel, "Their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made" (<a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
