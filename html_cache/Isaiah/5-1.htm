The "beloved" refers to God, and the "vineyard" symbolizes the nation of Israel. The use of a song indicates a message delivered with emotion and artistry, often used by prophets to capture attention. The vineyard imagery is common in the Bible, representing God's care and expectations for His people (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>). The song format suggests a lament or a love song, highlighting the deep relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>My beloved had a vineyard:</b><br>The vineyard is a metaphor for Israel, a nation chosen and cultivated by God. This imagery is rooted in the agricultural context of ancient Israel, where vineyards were valuable and required careful tending. The vineyard represents God's investment and care, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> and <a href="/hosea/10.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>. The possessive "my beloved" emphasizes God's personal and covenantal relationship with Israel, underscoring His role as both caretaker and judge.<p><b>on a very fertile hill:</b><br>The "fertile hill" signifies the ideal conditions provided by God for Israel to thrive. This geographical reference suggests a place of potential and blessing, akin to the Promised Land described in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>. Fertility implies not just physical abundance but spiritual opportunity. The hill may also symbolize elevation, both literally and spiritually, indicating a place set apart for divine purposes. This setting underscores the expectation of fruitfulness and the disappointment of unfulfilled potential, as later verses reveal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is delivering the message.

The language is warm and personal, showing that prophecy is not cold dictation but heartfelt worship. &#8226; Throughout Scripture, God&#8217;s people often break into song when declaring His works&#8212;see <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>, and <a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>. &#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s affection echoes David&#8217;s delight in the Lord in <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>, where the LORD Himself &#8220;rejoices over you with singing.&#8221; The phrase reminds us that truth about God must flow from relationship, not mere duty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a song of his vineyard</b><p>Isaiah specifies that the tune he&#8217;s about to sing is &#8220;a song of his vineyard&#8221;. &#8226; Vineyard imagery fills the Bible: <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-9</a> pictures God transplanting a vine from Egypt; Jesus&#8217; parables in <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a> and <a href="/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a> pick up the same theme; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-8</a> reveals Jesus as &#8220;the true vine.&#8221; &#8226; Calling it &#8220;his&#8221; vineyard underlines ownership: the vineyard belongs to the Beloved. That possessive pronoun insists on accountability&#8212;what happens in the vineyard reflects on its Owner (compare <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My beloved had a vineyard</b><p>Now Isaiah repeats, &#8220;My beloved had a vineyard&#8221;, moving from introduction to narration. &#8226; The prophet is speaking about the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a> will state it plainly: &#8220;the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel&#8221;). &#8226; By portraying God as the Beloved who &#8220;had&#8221; a vineyard, Isaiah shows that Israel&#8217;s history is grounded in covenant love, much like <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>&#8217;s marriage imagery and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>&#8217;s declaration of chosen love. &#8226; Owning a vineyard implies deliberate investment&#8212;clearing stones, planting choice vines, building a watchtower (all listed in <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>). God&#8217;s care is intentional, not accidental (compare <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on a very fertile hill</b><p>The line concludes, &#8220;on a very fertile hill&#8221;. &#8226; God did not plant His people in a wasteland; He set them in an ideal environment, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>, where the land is described as flowing with abundance. &#8226; A hill gives sunlight, drainage, and protection&#8212;prime viticulture. The setting underscores God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23-24</a>). &#8226; Because the conditions are perfect, any failure of the vineyard cannot be blamed on the soil. The stage is set for the moral thrust of <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2-7</a>: despite perfect care, the vineyard yields only worthless fruit (compare <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-43</a>, where similar language spotlights human responsibility).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> paints a loving God joyfully singing over a people He has carefully planted in the best of circumstances. Each phrase layers truth: the prophet&#8217;s song springs from affection, the vineyard belongs exclusively to the LORD, and its placement on a fertile hill showcases divine generosity. The verse invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s devoted investment in His people and to recognize that any coming judgment arises not from divine neglect but from human unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>V.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now will I sing to my wellbeloved.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Now let me sing. </span>The chapter bears every mark of being a distinct composition, perhaps the most elaborately finished in the whole of Isaiah. The parable with which it opens has for us the interest of having obviously supplied a starting-point for a later prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and for our Lord's teaching in the like parable of <a href="/context/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33-41</a>. Here, however, there is the distinctive touch of the irony of the opening verse. The prophet presents himself, as it were, in the character of a minstrel, ready to sing to his hearers one of the love-songs in which their culture delighted (<a href="/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a>.) In its language and rhythm it reminds us of the Song of Solomon. The very word "beloved" recalls <a href="/context/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1-2</a>; the description of the vineyards, that of <a href="/context/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11-13</a>. The probability that the parallelism was intentional is increased by the coincidence of <a href="/isaiah/7-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand sliver coins, it shall even be for briers and thorns.">Isaiah 7:23</a>, and <a href="/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, which will meet us further on. On this assumption Isaiah's words have a special interest as showing how early that poem lent itself to a mystical interpretation. One might almost conjecture that the prophet allured the people to listen by music as well as words, and appeared, as Elisha and other prophets had done, with harp or pipe in hand (<a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm" title="But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.">2Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was on Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.">1Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-29.htm" title="You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.">Isaiah 30:29</a>). The frequency of such hymns (Isaiah 12, 25, <a href="/context/isaiah/26-1.htm" title="In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>) shows, at any rate, that the prophet had received the training of a psalmist.

This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-16</a>), has been frequently noticed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now will I sing to my Well-beloved.</span> The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with "My Well-beloved," and ending with "wild grapes." It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name "Well-beloved" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">A song of my Well-beloved.</span> Bishop Lowth translates "A song of loves," and Mr. Cheyne "A love-song;" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is <span class="accented">not</span> a "love-song." May we not understand the words to mean "a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?" <span class="cmt_word">Touching his vineyard</span>. Israel is compared to a "vine" in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the Church of God to a "garden" in Canticles (<a href="/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>); perhaps also to a "vineyard" in the same book (<a href="/songs/8-12.htm">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">My Beloved hath a vineyard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">had a vineyard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In a very fruitful hill</span>. So the passage is generally understood, since <span class="accented">keren</span>, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and "son of oil" is a not unlikely Orientalism for "rich" or "fruitful." With the "hill" of this passage compare the "mountain" of <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and "cannot be hid" (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will sing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7891.htm">Strong's 7891: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for my beloved,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
