The Israelites were familiar with God's words and His promises, having been reminded of them repeatedly. This highlights the importance of listening and remembering God's revelations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to keep God's words in their hearts and teach them diligently.<p><b>look at them all.</b><br>Here, the emphasis is on observing the fulfillment of God's words. The Israelites are called to witness the evidence of God's faithfulness and power. This mirrors the call in <a href="/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a> to "come and see what the LORD has done," encouraging reflection on God's mighty works and fulfilled prophecies.<p><b>Will you not acknowledge them?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the Israelites to recognize and admit the truth of God's actions and words. It underscores the human tendency to ignore or forget divine intervention, as seen in the repeated forgetfulness of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). Acknowledgment is a call to faith and repentance, aligning with the call in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a> to recognize God's invisible qualities through His creation.<p><b>From now on I will tell you of new things,</b><br>God promises to reveal new revelations and plans, indicating His ongoing communication with His people. This points to the progressive nature of divine revelation, as seen in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan throughout Scripture, culminating in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<p><b>hidden things unknown to you.</b><br>These "hidden things" suggest mysteries of God's will and future events that were previously concealed. This aligns with the biblical theme of God revealing mysteries to His prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>) and the ultimate revelation of the mystery of Christ, which was hidden for ages but revealed in the New Testament (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).
