In ancient Near Eastern cultures, pegs were used to secure tents, symbolizing a firm foundation. The imagery of a peg driven into a firm place suggests that the individual being referred to will have a secure and established position. This can be seen as a metaphor for God&#8217;s sovereign appointment and the assurance of His plans. The context of <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a> involves a prophecy against Shebna, a steward in the royal palace, and the elevation of Eliakim, who is given a position of trust and authority. This imagery is also reminiscent of the messianic prophecies where Christ is seen as the cornerstone, a secure foundation for believers (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><b>and he will be a throne of glory</b><br>The throne symbolizes authority, honor, and governance. In the biblical context, a throne of glory indicates a position of high honor and divine approval. This phrase suggests that Eliakim will be a source of pride and dignity for his family and nation. The throne of glory can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of divine kingship and authority (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The imagery of a glorious throne points to the eschatological hope of Christ&#8217;s eternal reign, where He will sit on the throne of David, ruling with justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p><b>for the house of his father</b><br>This phrase indicates the familial and dynastic implications of Eliakim&#8217;s appointment. In the ancient world, family lineage and heritage were crucial for maintaining social and political stability. Eliakim&#8217;s elevation would bring honor and stability to his family line, contrasting with Shebna&#8217;s disgrace. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who brings honor and redemption to the house of David, fulfilling the promises made to David&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The house of his father also reflects the broader theme of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness to His people, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled through chosen individuals and their families.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
