In biblical context, trees often symbolize strength and prosperity (e.g., <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). The forests of Assyria, representing its military might and resources, will be decimated. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic theme of divine retribution against nations that oppose God's people, as seen in other prophetic books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>will be so few</b><br>The emphasis here is on the drastic reduction of Assyria's power and resources. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire known for its vast armies and wealth. The prophecy indicates a complete reversal of fortune, aligning with the biblical principle that pride and oppression lead to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of arrogance and injustice.<p><b>that a child could count them</b><br>This hyperbolic expression underscores the extent of Assyria's downfall. In ancient cultures, children were often seen as lacking the capacity for complex tasks, so the imagery of a child counting the remaining trees highlights the ease with which the remnants can be numbered. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God using the weak and humble to confound the strong and wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, where the seemingly insignificant will prevail through divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
