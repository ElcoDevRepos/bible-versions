In the context of Isaiah, it refers to the Israelites' idolatry and rebellion. Despite their sinful ways, God remains aware of their actions and intentions. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's intimate knowledge of humanity, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God is described as knowing our thoughts and actions. The phrase also underscores the idea that nothing is hidden from God, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>.<p><b>but I will heal him</b><br>Here, God promises restoration and healing, which is a recurring theme in Isaiah. This healing is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a return to righteousness and a restored relationship with God. The promise of healing is a testament to God's mercy and grace, despite the people's previous disobedience. This reflects the New Testament message of redemption through Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, where Jesus' sacrifice is described as bringing healing to believers.<p><b>I will guide him</b><br>God's guidance is a promise of divine direction and wisdom. In the historical context, this guidance would lead the Israelites back to the covenant relationship with God. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd guiding His flock. The guidance also foreshadows the role of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, who leads believers into all truth, as described in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<p><b>and restore comfort to him</b><br>Comfort in this context refers to consolation and peace after a period of distress or judgment. The promise of comfort is significant in Isaiah, often associated with the coming of the Messiah, who is described as the "Prince of Peace" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. This comfort is both immediate and eschatological, pointing to the ultimate comfort found in Christ's eternal kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God wipes away every tear.<p><b>and his mourners</b><br>The mourners are those who grieve over the sin and its consequences, possibly referring to the faithful remnant within Israel. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of restoration, where not only the individual but also the community experiences God's healing and comfort. It connects to the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>, where Jesus blesses those who mourn, promising they will be comforted. This reflects the biblical principle that God is close to the brokenhearted, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His intention to heal and restore.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wayward.htm">The Wayward</a></b><br>The individual whose ways God has seen, representing those who have strayed from righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mourners.htm">Mourners</a></b><br>Those who are grieving, possibly due to the consequences of sin or the loss of righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The broader context of Isaiah often addresses the nation of Israel, which is frequently depicted as wayward and in need of restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The author of the book, delivering God's message to the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_compassion.htm">God's Omniscience and Compassion</a></b><br>God sees all our ways, yet His response is one of healing and restoration, demonstrating His deep compassion and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_healing.htm">The Promise of Healing</a></b><br>Despite our waywardness, God offers healing.
