The "sign" is a divine assurance of deliverance and a promise of God's intervention. Signs in the Old Testament often served as confirmations of God's promises (e.g., the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>). Hezekiah, a king noted for his faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>), is directly addressed, emphasizing the personal nature of God's message to him.<p><b>This year you will eat what grows on its own:</b><br>This phrase indicates a reliance on volunteer crops, which are plants that grow without being sown, often from seeds left from the previous harvest. This situation reflects the immediate aftermath of the Assyrian invasion, where normal agricultural activities were disrupted. The Israelites would have to depend on what naturally grew in the fields, a situation reminiscent of the sabbatical year laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>).<p><b>and in the second year what springs from the same:</b><br>The continuation of eating from volunteer crops into the second year suggests ongoing hardship and recovery from the siege. This period of reliance on naturally occurring produce underscores the severity of the Assyrian threat and the time needed for the land and people to recover. It also highlights God's provision during times of scarcity, similar to His provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>But in the third year you will sow and reap;</b><br>The promise of sowing and reaping in the third year signifies a return to normalcy and stability. It is a prophetic assurance of restoration and renewal, indicating that the threat will be removed, and life will resume its regular pattern. This promise aligns with God's covenant faithfulness, as seen in His restoration of Israel after periods of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><b>you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit:</b><br>Planting vineyards and eating their fruit symbolizes long-term security and prosperity. Vineyards require years to mature, so this promise indicates a future of peace and abundance. The imagery of vineyards is often used in Scripture to depict blessing and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). This also foreshadows the Messianic age, where peace and abundance are fully realized (<a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian invasion.

It was then autumn, probably near the equinox, which was the beginning of a new year. The Assyrian invasion had stopped all tillage in the previous spring, and the people had to rely upon the spontaneous products of the fields. In the year that was about to open they would be still compelled to draw from the same source, but in twelve months' time the land would be clear of the invaders, and agriculture would resume its normal course, and the fulfilment of this prediction within the appointed limit of time would guarantee that of the wider promise that follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This shall be a sign unto thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the sign.</span> The prophet now turns to Hezekiah, and makes an address to him. "This," he says, "shall be the sign unto thee of Sennachcrib's being effectually 'bridled,' and the danger from Assyria over. In the third year from the present the land shall have returned to its normal condition, and you shall enjoy its fruits as formerly. Meanwhile you shall obtain sufficient nourishment from the grain which has sown itself." The "third year," according to Hebrew reckoning, might be little more than one year from the date of the delivery of the prophecy. The entire withdrawal of all the Assyrian garrisons from the country, which no doubt followed on Sennacherib's retreat, might well have occupied the greater part of a year. Till they were withdrawn, the Jews could not venture to till their territory. <span class="cmt_word">Plant vineyards</span>.
