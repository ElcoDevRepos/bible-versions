In the historical context, fasting was a common practice among the Israelites, often associated with repentance, mourning, or seeking God's intervention (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>, <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>). The people's expectation that God should respond to their fasting indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose of such spiritual disciplines. Biblically, fasting is meant to be an expression of genuine humility and repentance, not a mere ritual to gain God's favor (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>).<p><b>Why have we humbled ourselves, and You have not noticed?</b><br>Here, "humbled ourselves" refers to acts of self-denial and contrition, often accompanying fasting. The Israelites believed that their outward expressions of humility should compel God to act on their behalf. This reflects a cultural and religious misunderstanding, where external rituals were prioritized over internal transformation. The prophets frequently addressed this issue, emphasizing that God desires obedience and a contrite heart over mere ritual (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who criticized the Pharisees for their outward displays of piety without true righteousness (<a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>).<p><b>Behold, on the day of your fast, you do as you please,</b><br>This phrase highlights the hypocrisy of the people, who, despite fasting, continue to pursue their own interests. The word "behold" serves as a call to attention, indicating a significant discrepancy between their religious practices and their daily behavior. The cultural context reveals that fasting was often accompanied by expectations of social justice and care for the needy (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>). The people's failure to align their actions with the spirit of the fast demonstrates a disconnect between their religious observance and ethical conduct.<p><b>and you oppress all your workers.</b><br>This accusation points to the social injustices present among the Israelites, where even on days of fasting, they exploit and oppress their workers. The historical context of ancient Israel included a strong emphasis on justice and fair treatment of others, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>). The prophets often condemned such exploitation, calling for a return to righteousness and justice (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that true worship of God is inseparable from ethical treatment of others, a theme echoed in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

In practice, however, they were often held in times of calamity (comp. <a href="/isaiah/32-12.htm" title="They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.">Isaiah 32:12</a>; <a href="/joel/1-13.htm" title="Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: howl, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God.">Joel 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.">2Chronicles 20:3</a>),and we may legitimately think of them as having been more or less frequent under Hezekiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/37-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.">Isaiah 37:1-2</a>). Now, as though that had been a meritorious work, the people ask what good had come of it? After the exile fasts were instituted, commemorative of the siege of Jerusalem, its capture, its destruction, and the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="/zechariah/7-3.htm" title="And to speak to the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?">Zechariah 7:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.">Zechariah 8:19</a>), and those who maintain the later date of the book naturally suppose that these are the fasts referred to. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?</span> The fasting' spoken of is probably that of the great Day of Atonement. the only fasting commanded in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>). Other fasts were from time to time appointed by civil or ecclesiastical authority (<a href="/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9, 12</a>:<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>; <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12, 15</a>); but they were rare, and do not seem to be here intended. Still, the lesson is general, and would apply to all occasions of fasting. The Jews of the time expected, it would seem, some special definite result, in the way of victory or relief, to follow from their observance of the Atonement fast. As it did not follow, they regarded themselves as ill used, and accordingly made complaint. Their feelings approached to those of the Vedic worshippers, who regarded their religious observances as "not merely pleasing. the god who was the object of them, but as laying him under a binding obligation, and almost compelling him to grant the requests of the worshipper" ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144). Afflicted our soul These are the exact words of <a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>, by which the fast of the great Day of Atonement was instituted. <span class="cmt_word">And thou takest no knowledge</span>; rather, <span class="accented">no notice. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the day of your fast ye find pleasure</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render, "ye carry on business," which accords better with the clause which follows. The great Day of Atonement was, like the sabbath, a day on which no work was to be done (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>). The Jews, while priding themselves on their observance of the day, did not really observe it in this particular. <span class="cmt_word">And exact all your labours</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "require of your servants and subordinates all the services that they have to render on other days." Days of religious observance, even under the Law, were always intended to be days of kindly forbearance towards the poor, of the remission of burdens, or even of the actual giving of relief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/58-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1444;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have we fasted,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;am&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6684.htm">Strong's 6684: </a> </span><span class="str2">To abstain from food, fast</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and You have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
