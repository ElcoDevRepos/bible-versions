In Isaiah, "that day" frequently points to the Day of the Lord, a time when God will intervene decisively in human history. It can indicate both immediate historical events and eschatological fulfillment.<p><b>seven women will take hold of one man</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible. Here, it suggests a significant imbalance between men and women, likely due to the devastation of war, where many men have died. This scenario reflects a desperate situation where women seek security and social standing through marriage, even if it means sharing one husband.<p><b>and say, &#8220;We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothes.</b><br>This indicates a reversal of traditional marital roles, where a husband would typically provide for his wife. The women's willingness to support themselves highlights their desperation to remove the stigma of being unmarried. It also reflects the economic hardship and societal collapse following judgment.<p><b>Just let us be called by your name.</b><br>Being called by a man's name signifies marriage and the social protection it affords. In ancient Israel, a woman's identity and security were closely tied to her marital status. This plea underscores the cultural importance of marriage and the shame associated with being unmarried.<p><b>Take away our disgrace!&#8221;</b><br>The disgrace refers to the social stigma of being unmarried and childless, which was significant in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This plea for the removal of disgrace can also be seen as a metaphor for Israel's spiritual condition, seeking redemption and restoration. The concept of disgrace and its removal is echoed in other scriptures, such as in the redemptive work of Christ, who takes away the shame of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_women.htm">Seven Women</a></b><br>Symbolic of a large number, representing the desperation and societal imbalance due to the scarcity of men, likely caused by war or judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/one_man.htm">One Man</a></b><br>Represents the few surviving men after a period of judgment, highlighting the dire circumstances and the reversal of traditional roles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disgrace.htm">Disgrace</a></b><br>Refers to the shame and social stigma of being unmarried or childless in ancient Israelite society, which was seen as a curse or judgment from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_judgment.htm">Cultural Context and Judgment</a></b><br>Understand the cultural significance of marriage and family in ancient Israel.

With many men slain (<a href="/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>), society is left lopsided, and the women feel the consequences.<p>- Scripture never exaggerates; the prophecy points to a literal season when the land is devastated and survivors grapple with scarcity and shame (<a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven women will take hold of one man</b><p>- &#8220;seven women&#8221; reflects an extreme shortage of husbands after war, confirming <a href="/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>: &#8220;Your men will fall by the sword.&#8221;<p>- Taking &#8220;hold&#8221; pictures urgency and desperation (<a href="/ruth/1-14.htm">Ruth 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>). The normal approach to marriage is reversed; women now press for acceptance.<p>- God predicted such inversion as a curse for covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22, 26</a>), underscoring the literal, covenantal backdrop.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we will eat our own bread and provide our own clothes</b><p>- Their pledge, &#8220;our own bread,&#8221; shows willingness to forgo the customary provision a husband supplied (<a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>).<p>- They ask for no dowry, no support&#8212;only relief from reproach. Self-reliance here is not noble independence but evidence of social collapse (<a href="/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>- The scene reminds us that sin&#8217;s fallout touches everyday needs: food, clothing, security (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just let us be called by your name</b><p>- Claiming &#8220;your name&#8221; means legal marriage, gaining the man&#8217;s household identity (<a href="/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm">Isaiah 56:5</a>).<p>- Name conveys covering, protection, and future; compare the honorable place Ruth seeks under Boaz&#8217;s name (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>).<p>- Isaiah later promises a remnant will bear God&#8217;s own name, pointing beyond human solutions to divine restoration (<a href="/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take away our disgrace!</b><p>- &#8220;our disgrace&#8221; refers to the stigma of barrenness or singleness in that culture (<a href="/genesis/30-23.htm">Genesis 30:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>- Shame in Scripture is often tied to covenant failure; only the Lord can lift it completely (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>).<p>- The cry foreshadows the gospel: Christ removes reproach, presenting His bride &#8220;without spot or wrinkle&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a> literally pictures a devastated society where women beg a single man for marriage simply to erase shame, offering to meet their own material needs.

Yet it also hints at a deeper hope: only by taking hold of a greater Name&#8212;God&#8217;s own&#8212;can lasting disgrace be removed and true security restored.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And in that day seven women . . .</span>--The chapter division wrongly separates this verse from the foregoing.

As men sought eagerly, yet in vain, a protector, so women should seek for a husband. Those who had been wooed and courted, and had been proudly fastidious, should supplicate in eager rivalry (the seven women to one man implies a land depopulated by war, and so making polygamy natural) for the protection of marriage, and that not on the usual conditions of having food and clothing found for them (<a href="/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>), but as working for their own livelihood.<p><span class= "bld">To take away our reproach.</span>--Better, as an imperative, <span class= "ital">take thou away. </span>The reproach is that of being childless.

As there, in the evil time of God's judgment, the despairing men are represented as" taking hold" of a respectable man to make him their judge, so now the despairing women "take hold" of such a man and request him to allow them all to be regarded as his wives. There has been such a destruction - men are become so scarce - that no otherwise can women escape the shame and reproach of being unwedded and childless. <span class="cmt_word">Our own bread will we eat</span>.

Children were regarded as such a blessing in the ancient times that to be childless was a misfortune and a subject of reproach. Hagar "despised" the barren Sarai (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). Her "adversary provoked Hannah sore, because the Lord had shut up her womb" (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>). Compare the lament of Antigone, who views it as a disgrace that she descends to the tomb unwed (Soph., 'Antig.,' 11. 813-816). Among the Jews childlessness was a special reproach, because it took away all possibility of the woman being in the line of the Messiah's descent (comp. <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
