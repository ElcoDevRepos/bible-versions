In the context of Isaiah, it signifies a future time when individuals will openly profess their commitment to Yahweh. This is significant in the historical context of Israel, where idolatry was prevalent, and such a declaration would mark a return to monotheistic worship. The phrase also echoes the covenant relationship between God and His people, reminiscent of the declarations found in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17-18</a>, where Israel affirms their identity as God's chosen people. This personal identification with the LORD can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of being "in Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>another will call himself by the name of Jacob,</b><br>Here, the reference to Jacob signifies a connection to the patriarchal heritage of Israel. Jacob, later named Israel, is a central figure in the history of the Jewish people, and calling oneself by his name implies an embrace of this heritage and identity. This phrase suggests a restoration of national identity and pride in being part of God's chosen people. It also points to the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>, where God reaffirms His covenant with Jacob. This identification with Jacob can be seen as a type of spiritual rebirth, aligning with the New Testament theme of being born again (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<p><b>and still another will write on his hand, &#8216;The LORD&#8217;s,&#8217;</b><br>Writing on the hand symbolizes a permanent and visible mark of ownership and dedication. In ancient cultures, slaves or servants might bear the mark of their master, indicating to whom they belonged. This imagery suggests a voluntary and public declaration of belonging to God. It parallels the practice of binding God's commandments on one's hand as a sign of devotion, as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>. This act of writing "The LORD's" on one's hand can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of being sealed with the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>), indicating God's ownership and protection.<p><b>and will take the name of Israel.&#8221;</b><br>Taking the name of Israel signifies a full acceptance of the identity and mission of God's people. Israel, meaning "God prevails," is not just a national identity but a spiritual one, representing those who strive with God and are part of His redemptive plan. This phrase indicates a future gathering and unification of God's people, transcending ethnic and national boundaries, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the spiritual Israel, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>, where Paul speaks of Gentiles being grafted into the olive tree of Israel. This reflects the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose name was changed to Israel, representing the nation of Israel and God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation descended from Jacob, chosen by God to be His people and to bear His name.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_isaiah.htm">The Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The author of the book, a major prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_god.htm">The People of God</a></b><br>Those who identify themselves as belonging to the LORD, whether by birthright or by faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_god.htm">Identity in God</a></b><br>Belonging to the LORD is a profound declaration of identity.

It echoes <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>, &#8220;We are His people and the sheep of His pasture,&#8221; and <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, &#8220;The Lord knows those who are His.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It flows directly from the promise in v. 3&#8211;4 that God will &#8220;pour out My Spirit on your offspring.&#8221; When the Spirit comes, lips are loosened to say openly, &#8220;I am the LORD&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase also recalls <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>, where God states, &#8220;I will say to those who were not My people, &#8216;You are My people!&#8217; and they will say, &#8216;You are my God!&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Taking the statement at face value, God foresees real individuals who will literally stand up and align themselves with Him. In a world full of competing allegiances, they pick the Lord and proudly say so.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another will call himself by the name of Jacob,</b><p>The second line widens the circle from personal devotion to family identity.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Jacob&#8221; represents the covenant lineage. To &#8220;call himself by the name of Jacob&#8221; means openly embracing the heritage of the patriarchs (see <a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This anticipates Gentiles grafted into Israel&#8217;s blessings&#8212;<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a> speaks of wild branches joined to the cultivated olive tree. Yet it also promises ethnic Israelites reclaiming their ancestral faith after exile (<a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It harmonizes with <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>, &#8220;If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&#8217;s seed.&#8221; In other words, whether natural or adopted, believers gladly identify with Jacob&#8217;s line.<p>&#8226; Literally, God foresaw Jews and former outsiders alike wearing the family name with honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>still another will write on his hand, &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s,&#8221;</b><p>Now the loyalty turns visible.<p>&#8226; Writing on the hand was an ancient mark of ownership, like a brand on a servant (cf. <a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>). Instead of being forced, these servants choose the mark.<p>&#8226; Isaiah later pictures the opposite side of the relationship: &#8220;I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a>). Here people inscribe themselves for Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a> shows a future fulfillment when believers bear &#8220;His name and His Father&#8217;s name on their foreheads,&#8221; the godly contrast to the mark of the beast (<a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the verse portrays a public, even physical, testimony&#8212;faith isn&#8217;t hidden in a pocket; it&#8217;s displayed on the skin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will take the name of Israel.</b><p>The verse closes with a collective embrace.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Israel&#8221; is the nation restored and blessed.

When God gathers His people, they will once again bear His name proudly and experience the promised land&#8217;s fullness.<p>&#8226; Literally, the promise looks to a day when both returning Jews and believing Gentiles will gladly stand under the banner &#8220;Israel,&#8221; unified by the Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a> sketches four snapshots of wholehearted allegiance springing from God&#8217;s outpoured Spirit.

It was usual among the heathen nations to mark the name of a god upon the bodies of persons specially devoted to him (Herod., 2:113; 7:235); and, though the practice was forbidden to Israelites (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), it might naturally continue in use among semi-heathen proselytes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/44-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I [belong]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
