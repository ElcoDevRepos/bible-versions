In the context of Isaiah, God often speaks through the prophet to convey His plans and purposes. This sets the tone for a message of significant importance.<p><b>&#8220;It is not enough for You to be My Servant,</b><br>The term "Servant" here is a reference to the Servant of the Lord, a key figure in Isaiah's prophecies.

The phrase suggests that the Servant's role is not limited to a single task or group.<p><b>to raise up the tribes of Jacob,</b><br>The tribes of Jacob refer to the twelve tribes of Israel, descendants of Jacob. The task of raising them up implies restoration and renewal, addressing the historical context of Israel's exile and dispersion.

He wrought a miracle for a Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="/mark/7-25.htm">Mark 7:25-30</a>). His apostles, after a little time, understood that the gospel was for the world at large, and declared that in Christ there was no difference between Jew and Greek, nay! between Jew and barbarian. Christ had died for all - had come to be a Light to all, would have all come into his Church and obtain salvation through union with him. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest be my Salvation</span>. Christ is called "Salvation," as the Bearer of salvation - he through whom alone can any man be saved (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). So he is called "Peace" (<a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>), as the Giver of peace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/49-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He says,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
