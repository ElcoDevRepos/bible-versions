The imagery of a sword soaked in blood is a powerful representation of God's justice against sin and rebellion. In biblical context, the sword often symbolizes God's instrument of judgment (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41-42</a>). This passage reflects the seriousness of God's retribution against nations that oppose Him, emphasizing His sovereignty and righteousness.<p><b>It drips with fat&#8212;with the blood of lambs and goats,</b><br>The mention of lambs and goats alludes to sacrificial practices in ancient Israel, where these animals were commonly used in offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>). The imagery of fat and blood highlights the completeness of the sacrifice, as fat was considered the best part and was offered to God (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). This phrase underscores the totality of the judgment, akin to a sacrificial offering, indicating that the judgment is both thorough and divinely ordained.<p><b>with the fat of the kidneys of rams.</b><br>The kidneys and their fat were considered the choicest parts of sacrificial animals, reserved for God (<a href="/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a>). This detail emphasizes the richness and completeness of the sacrifice, symbolizing the totality of God's judgment. The use of sacrificial language connects this judgment to the idea of atonement, though in this context, it is the nations being judged rather than sin being atoned for.<p><b>For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah,</b><br>Bozrah was a major city in Edom, known for its fortifications and wealth. The mention of Bozrah indicates a specific target of God's judgment, highlighting Edom's historical enmity with Israel (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11-12</a>). The use of "sacrifice" suggests that the judgment is a divine act of justice, akin to a ritual offering, where the enemies of God are the ones being offered up.<p><b>a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</b><br>Edom, descendants of Esau, often opposed Israel, leading to prophetic declarations of judgment against them (<a href="/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-21</a>). The "great slaughter" signifies a comprehensive and devastating judgment, fulfilling prophecies of Edom's downfall. This serves as a warning to all nations that oppose God's people, illustrating the ultimate triumph of divine justice. Theologically, it foreshadows the final judgment when God will decisively deal with all opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, representing divine judgment and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bozrah.htm">Bozrah</a></b><br>A city in Edom, symbolizing the enemies of God and a place of divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, often representing opposition to Israel and God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lambs,_goats,_rams.htm">Lambs, Goats, Rams</a></b><br>Animals used in sacrificial rituals, symbolizing the completeness and totality of the judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword_of_the_lord.htm">The Sword of the LORD</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's judgment and wrath against sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_is_certain.htm">Divine Judgment is Certain</a></b><br>God's judgment is depicted as inevitable and thorough, reminding believers of the seriousness of sin and rebellion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The use of sacrificial animals underscores the completeness of God's judgment and the need for atonement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The prophecy against Edom illustrates God's control over all nations and His ability to execute justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Understanding the severity of God's judgment should lead individuals and nations to repentance and seeking God's mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_justice.htm">Hope in God's Justice</a></b><br>For believers, the certainty of God's justice provides hope that evil will not prevail indefinitely.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_34_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 34:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_34_6_God_s_judgment_on_nations.htm">How does Isaiah 34:6 illustrate God's judgment against nations opposing His will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_divine_justice_entail.htm">What does "the LORD has a sacrifice" reveal about divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_34_6_God_s_holiness_righteousness.htm">How can Isaiah 34:6 deepen our understanding of God's holiness and righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_34_6_Revelation_Judgment_link.htm">How does Isaiah 34:6 connect to Revelation's depiction of God's final judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Isaiah_34_6_on_repentance.htm">How should Isaiah 34:6 influence our response to God's call for repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_34_6_on_God_s_judgment.htm">What does Isaiah 34:6 reveal about God's judgment and wrath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_34_6_and_divine_justice_context.htm">How does Isaiah 34:6 fit into the context of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_sacrifice_imagery_in_Isaiah_34_6.htm">Why is the imagery of sacrifice used in Isaiah 34:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_34.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_edom's_fate_in_the_bible.htm">What fate awaits Edom according to biblical prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_confirm_isaiah_21_11-12_on_dumah.htm">How can Isaiah 21:11&#8211;12&#8217;s prophecy concerning Dumah be confirmed when archaeological evidence about its fate is so limited?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_edom's_judgment_in_isaiah.htm">Does Isaiah 34:5-6 have any historical or archaeological evidence to support its portrayal of Edom's judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_confirm_isaiah_21_11-12_on_dumah.htm">How can Isaiah 21:11-12's prophecy concerning Dumah be confirmed when archaeological evidence about its fate is so limited?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 34:6 Mean</div><b>The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood</b><p>&#8226;

His sword&#8212;completely soaked&#8212;signals thorough retribution. The mention of lambs, goats, and the choicest fat shows that those judged become the offering, from the least to the greatest. Bozrah, Edom&#8217;s pride, turns into God&#8217;s altar, fulfilling multiple prophetic threads that culminate when Christ returns in glory. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s justice is certain, comprehensive, and centered on His own holiness, while warning the rebellious that no power or place can shield them from the day His sword is unsheathed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah . . .</span>--Two cities of this name appear in history; one in the Hauran, more or less conspicuous in ecclesiastical history, and the other, of which Isaiah now speaks, in Edom.

The threats here uttered against it are repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), who says that "Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; all the cities thereof [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dependent cities] shall be perpetual wastes." Bozrah is probably identified with the modern <span class="accented">El-Busaireh</span>, a village of about fifty houses, occupying a site in the position above indicated, amid ruins which seem to be those of a considerable city (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 407; Robinson, 'Researches in Palestine,' vol. 2. pp. 570, 571). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/34-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sword</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2719.htm">Strong's 2719: </a> </span><span class="str2">Drought, a cutting instrument, as a, knife, sword</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
