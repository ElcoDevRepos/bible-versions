Historically, this could refer to Assyria, a dominant force during Isaiah's time, known for its military conquests and oppressive tactics. The "woe" is a prophetic declaration of impending judgment, a common theme in prophetic literature, indicating divine displeasure and the certainty of future punishment. This reflects the biblical principle that those who live by violence will ultimately face divine justice.<p><b>O traitor never betrayed!</b><br>The term "traitor" suggests deceit and betrayal, possibly pointing to nations or leaders who have broken covenants or acted treacherously. In the context of Isaiah, this could again refer to Assyria, which often broke treaties and acted unfaithfully towards other nations, including Israel and Judah. The phrase underscores the moral law of reciprocity found throughout scripture, where betrayal leads to eventual betrayal by others, aligning with the biblical theme of reaping what one sows.<p><b>When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the inevitable consequence of destructive behavior. It serves as a warning that the cycle of violence and destruction will come full circle. Biblically, this reflects the principle of divine retribution, where God ensures that justice is served. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where all destructive forces will be subdued and judged at the end of times, as seen in Revelation.<p><b>When you have finished betraying, you will be betrayed.</b><br>This phrase reinforces the theme of divine justice and the moral order established by God. It suggests that betrayal will not go unpunished and that those who deceive others will themselves face deception. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice, where the wicked are eventually ensnared by their own schemes. It also echoes the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of integrity and warned against hypocrisy and deceit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>This refers to a nation or group that acts as an aggressor or oppressor, often seen as Assyria in the context of Isaiah's prophecies.

A thought is expressed in one, or it may be two, verses, and then another follows without anything to link it on. This may be, perhaps, explained either by the strong emotion which filled the prophet's mind as he looked on the coming perils of his country, or, as I think, more probably, on the assumption that we have a series of rough notes, memoranda for a long discourse, which was afterwards delivered in a more continuous form. They would, perhaps, be more intelligible if they were printed separately, as we print Pascal's <span class= "ital">Pensees, </span>the verse arrangement giving a fictitious semblance of continuity. The opening words are addressed to Sennacherib when he entered on his second campaign against Judah, as it seemed to Isaiah, without the slightest provocation. Hezekiah had submitted, and had paid an enormous indemnity for the costs of the war (<a href="/context/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13-16</a>) at the close of the first campaign, and had, in the meantime, taken no aggressive action. The invasion was one of undisguised spoliation and rapacity. (For "treacherously," read <span class= "ital">rapaciously.</span>) Upon such aggressiveness there was sure to come a righteous retribution, and in that thought the prophet finds comfort.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - THE JUDGMENT ON ASSYRIA AND DELIVERANCE OF JERUSALEM, STATED GENERALLY. Events had progressed since the preceding prophecies were delivered. The negotiations carried on with Sennacherib had been futile (ver. 7), the heavy fine imposed and paid (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>) had been of no avail (ver. 18); the Assyrian monarch was still dissatisfied, and threatened a second siege. Already he was upon his march, spoiling and ravaging (ver. 1). The people of the country districts had removed into the town (ver. 8) - in a little time the vast host might be expected to appear before the walls. All was terror, grief, and confusion. Under these circumstances, Isaiah is once more commissioned to declare the approaching discomfiture of the mighty conqueror, and deliverance of Jerusalem out of his hand (vers. 3, 4). The deliverance ushers in a reign of righteousness (Vers. 5, 6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to thee that spoilest</span>. The "spoiler" is here, evidently, Assyria - the world-power of this entire group of prophecies (see especially <a href="/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>), and the greatest "spoiler" of Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou wast not spoiled</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that hast not yet been spoiled thyself."
