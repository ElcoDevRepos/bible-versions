The name of God represents His character and presence, and calling on His name signifies a relationship and dependence on Him. This lack of calling on God can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>, where God foretells that the Israelites would turn to other gods and He would hide His face from them. The absence of calling on God's name indicates a breakdown in the covenant relationship, similar to the spiritual condition described in <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2-3</a>, where none seek God.<p><b>or strives to take hold of You.</b><br>This phrase suggests a lack of effort or desire to pursue a relationship with God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, striving to take hold of God would involve prayer, worship, and adherence to His commandments. The imagery of taking hold can be seen in <a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>, where Jacob wrestles with God and refuses to let go until he receives a blessing. This striving indicates a fervent pursuit of God's presence and favor, which is absent in the people Isaiah addresses. The New Testament echoes this call to actively seek God in passages like <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, which encourages believers to draw near to God.<p><b>For You have hidden Your face from us</b><br>The hiding of God's face is a metaphor for His withdrawal of favor and presence, often as a response to the people's sin and disobedience. This concept is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon their faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28). The hiding of God's face is a form of divine judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/39-23.htm">Ezekiel 39:23-24</a>, where God hides His face due to Israel's unfaithfulness. This withdrawal is not permanent but serves as a call to repentance and restoration.<p><b>and delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.</b><br>This phrase indicates that God has allowed the people to experience the consequences of their sins. The "hand of our iniquity" suggests being overpowered or controlled by their own sinful actions, leading to suffering and judgment. This concept is consistent with the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where individuals face the outcomes of their actions. Historically, this can be seen in the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were taken captive due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience. Theologically, it underscores the need for repentance and reliance on God's mercy for deliverance from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose face is hidden from the people due to their iniquity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The recipients of Isaiah's message, who are experiencing a period of spiritual decline and separation from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The sin and moral failing that have caused a separation between the people and God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of Isaiah often relates to the Babylonian exile, a period of judgment and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence_of_sin.htm">The Consequence of Sin</a></b><br>Sin creates a barrier between us and God, leading to spiritual desolation and separation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god.htm">The Importance of Seeking God</a></b><br>Actively calling on God's name and striving to take hold of Him is crucial for maintaining a close relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_hidden_face.htm">God's Hidden Face</a></b><br>When God hides His face, it is often a response to persistent sin, urging us to repent and seek His presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each believer has a responsibility to seek God and repent from iniquity, rather than waiting passively for change.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>Despite the separation caused by sin, there is always hope for restoration through repentance and seeking God earnestly.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_64_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 64:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_not_be_hidden_from_God.htm">How can we avoid being "hidden" from God's face in Isaiah 64:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_hide_His_face_in_Isaiah_64_7.htm">What causes God to "hide His face" according to Isaiah 64:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_64_7_2_Chron_7_14_Seek_God.htm">How does Isaiah 64:7 relate to 2 Chronicles 7:14 about seeking God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_consistently_call_on_Him.htm">In what ways can we "call on His name" more consistently?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_64_7_s_call_against_complacency.htm">How does Isaiah 64:7 challenge us to address spiritual complacency?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_64_7_God_s_response_to_sin.htm">What does Isaiah 64:7 reveal about God's response to human sinfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_64_7_s_take_on_divine_intervention.htm">How does Isaiah 64:7 challenge the concept of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_highlight_God_s_hidden_face_in_64_7.htm">Why does Isaiah 64:7 emphasize God's hidden face?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_64.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 64?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_suicide.htm">What defines true righteousness according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_isaiah_7_14_predict_jesus's_birth.htm">Matthew 1:22-23 - Does Isaiah 7:14 really foretell Jesus's birth, or was that prophecy intended for a different context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_isaiah_53_7_with_gospels.htm">According to Isaiah 53:7, the servant remains silent when oppressed, yet in the Gospels Jesus speaks during his trials--how do we reconcile this contradiction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_iniquity_mean.htm">What does iniquity mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 64:7 Mean</div><b>No one calls on Your name</b><p>Isaiah laments that the people have ceased crying out to the Lord.
