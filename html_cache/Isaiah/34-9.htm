In biblical times, Edom was a region southeast of Israel, known for its rugged terrain and strategic location. The transformation of streams to tar symbolizes desolation and destruction, as streams are typically sources of life and sustenance. This imagery is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-28</a>), where fire and brimstone rained down, turning the land into a wasteland. The use of tar, a sticky, flammable substance, suggests a scene of burning and ruin, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>and her soil to sulfur</b><br>Sulfur, often associated with fire and brimstone, is a symbol of divine wrath and purification. The transformation of soil to sulfur indicates a curse upon the land, rendering it uninhabitable and barren. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic language used throughout the Bible to describe God's judgment on nations that oppose His will. The reference to sulfur connects to the apocalyptic visions in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>), where sulfur is used to describe the lake of fire, a place of eternal punishment. This transformation underscores the irreversible nature of God's judgment on Edom.<p><b>her land will become a blazing pitch</b><br>The phrase "blazing pitch" evokes a scene of intense, unquenchable fire. Pitch, a viscous substance derived from tar, is highly flammable, and its burning represents total devastation. This imagery is used to convey the idea of perpetual destruction, where the land is consumed by fire, leaving nothing behind. The concept of a land becoming a blazing pitch is a powerful metaphor for divine retribution, illustrating the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and justice, where unrighteousness is met with severe punishment. The imagery also serves as a warning to other nations, highlighting the seriousness of turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, often symbolizing God's enemies in prophetic literature. <a href="/bsb/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a> is a prophecy against Edom, representing divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, whose ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

The prophecy is literal&#8212;targeting Edom for her historic hostility toward God&#8217;s people&#8212;and illustrative, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment awaiting all persistent rebellion. God&#8217;s control over water, earth, and fire reminds us that He alone sustains life and He alone has the right to withdraw it. For the faithful, the passage reinforces confidence in His justice; for the wayward, it is an urgent call to repentance before streams dry up, soil burns, and the land itself testifies to the consuming holiness of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9, 10) <span class= "bld">The streams thereof shall be turned into pitch . . .</span>--The imagery of the punishment which is to fall on Edom is suggested partly by the scenery of the Dead Sea, partly by the volcanic character of Edom itself, with its extinct craters and streams of lava. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm" title="As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.">Jeremiah 49:18</a>.) The prophet sees the destruction, as continuing not merely in its results, but in its process, the smoke of the burning craters rising up perpetually, and making the land uninhabitable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the streams thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the streams of the land of Edom." Though Edom has no perennial rivers, it has numerous torrent-courses to carry off the winter rains (see <a href="/2_kings/3-20.htm">2 Kings 3:20-22</a>). These should run with pitch, instead of water. The general idea is that Edom should be visited with a destruction like that of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>). But the prophet scarcely intends his words to be taken literally; he is making Edom a type or representation of God's enemies, and the gist of his teaching is that a dreadful vengeance, an utter destruction, will come upon all who set themselves up against the Most High. In the next verse he declares that the vengeance will be eternal (comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/34-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Her streams</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1433;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;le&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
