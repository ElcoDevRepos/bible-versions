It echoes earlier prophetic calls for Israel to return to God (<a href="/isaiah/52.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>). The repetition emphasizes urgency and importance, suggesting a need for immediate action. This phrase is reminiscent of other biblical calls to awaken from spiritual slumber, such as in <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>, where believers are urged to wake from sleep because salvation is near.<p><b>Rise up, O Jerusalem,</b><br>Jerusalem, the city central to Jewish identity and worship, symbolizes the people of God. The call to rise up indicates a movement from a state of despair or judgment to one of restoration and hope. Historically, Jerusalem had faced numerous sieges and destructions, notably by the Babylonians in 586 BC. This phrase anticipates a reversal of fortunes, aligning with prophecies of restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a> and <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>.<p><b>you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of His fury;</b><br>The imagery of drinking from a cup is a common biblical metaphor for experiencing God's wrath or judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>). The "hand of the LORD" signifies direct divine intervention. Historically, this refers to the period of exile and suffering due to the nation's disobedience. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty in administering justice. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, where the cup of God's wrath is mentioned in the context of final judgment.<p><b>you who have drained the goblet to the dregs&#8212;</b><br>Draining the goblet to the dregs implies experiencing the full measure of God's judgment. The "dregs" are the sediment at the bottom of a cup, symbolizing the most intense and bitter part of the experience. This phrase highlights the completeness of the judgment that Jerusalem has endured. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>.<p><b>the cup that makes men stagger.</b><br>Staggering is a result of overwhelming intoxication, symbolizing the disorientation and helplessness caused by divine judgment. This imagery is used to convey the severity of God's wrath, which leaves the recipients powerless and confused. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment leading to repentance and eventual restoration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9-10</a> and <a href="/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>. The ultimate fulfillment of this theme is found in Christ, who, in the Garden of Gethsemane, prayed about the cup of suffering He was to endure (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), taking upon Himself the wrath meant for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city represents the people of Israel, often personified in the Bible.

The dregs of the cup; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the goblet-cup</span> (Cheyne), or <span class="accented">the out-swollen cup.</span> It is the fulness of the measure of Jerusalem's punishment, not its character, which is pointed at. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/51-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Awaken,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wr&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">awaken!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wr&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Rise up,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1434;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#363;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1460;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have drunk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8354.htm">Strong's 8354: </a> </span><span class="str2">To imbibe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;ya&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
