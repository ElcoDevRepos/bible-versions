In the context of <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, King Hezekiah has been granted an extension of life after a severe illness, highlighting the value of life as an opportunity to worship and thank God. Biblically, life is seen as a gift from God, and the living are called to use their time to glorify Him (<a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17-18</a>). The emphasis on "only the living" underscores the urgency and privilege of praising God while one has the chance, as the dead cannot participate in this act of worship.<p><b>as I do today</b><br>Hezekiah's personal gratitude is expressed here, reflecting his immediate response to God's deliverance. This moment of thanksgiving is not just a future promise but a present reality. It serves as a model for believers to express gratitude in the present moment, recognizing God's interventions in their lives. The phrase "as I do today" also connects to the biblical theme of living in the present and acknowledging God's work daily (<a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>).<p><b>fathers will tell their children about Your faithfulness</b><br>This phrase highlights the biblical principle of passing down faith through generations. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, parents are instructed to teach their children about God's commandments and faithfulness. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on oral tradition and storytelling as a means of preserving history and faith. This transmission of faith ensures that God's acts are remembered and celebrated by future generations, fostering a continuous legacy of faithfulness. The reference to "fathers" also points to the patriarchal structure of ancient society, where the head of the family played a crucial role in spiritual instruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who was ill and prayed for healing.

And his mother's name was Hephzibah.">2Kings 21:1</a>), was not born till two or three years afterwards. At the time of his illness the king may still have been childless, and the thought that there was no son to take his place may have added bitterness to his grief.
