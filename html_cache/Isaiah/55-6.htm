In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were being called to repentance and renewal of their covenant relationship with God. Historically, this was a time when the people were facing the consequences of their disobedience, including exile. The call to seek the LORD suggests a window of opportunity that may not always be available. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>, which also urges seeking God for life. Theologically, it underscores the concept of God's grace being available but not indefinitely, highlighting the importance of responding to God's call promptly.<p><b>call on Him while He is near.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that there are times when God is especially accessible to His people. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, calling on God was an act of worship and dependence, often associated with prayer and sacrifice. The nearness of God can be seen in the context of His covenant promises and His presence among His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>. This also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God being near through Jesus Christ, who is Emmanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). The phrase encourages believers to take advantage of God's presence and willingness to respond to those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

Isaiah&#8217;s wider context (55:1-5) invites thirsty souls to come for free grace; verse 6 calls for a wholehearted response (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>: &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The pursuit is life-giving. <a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>, records the same plea: &#8220;Seek Me and live!&#8221; Jesus echoes it in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>: &#8220;Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,&#8221; promising God&#8217;s provision in return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>While He May Be Found</b><p>&#8226; Opportunity is not endless.
