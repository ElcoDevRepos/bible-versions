Jerusalem, as the capital city, represents the spiritual and political heart of Israel. The mention of both Jerusalem and Judah emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the message, targeting both urban and rural populations. Historically, this period was marked by social injustice and spiritual decline, which Isaiah frequently addressed. The call to the "dwellers" signifies a communal responsibility and awareness of the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>I exhort you to judge</b><br>The use of "exhort" implies a strong urging or appeal, suggesting that the people are being called to a serious and reflective decision-making process. The concept of judgment here is not merely legal but moral and spiritual, inviting the people to discern right from wrong. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s people being called to exercise discernment and justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which emphasizes doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God. The call to judge also foreshadows the coming judgment upon Israel for their unfaithfulness.<p><b>between Me and My vineyard</b><br>The "vineyard" is a metaphor for Israel, a common biblical symbol representing God&#8217;s people (see <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a> and <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>). This imagery highlights the care and investment God has made in His people, expecting them to bear fruit in terms of righteousness and justice. The vineyard metaphor also connects to the idea of stewardship and accountability, as God expects His people to live according to His statutes. The phrase "between Me and My vineyard" suggests a legal dispute, where God presents His case against Israel for their failure to live up to their covenantal obligations. This sets the stage for the prophetic message of judgment and redemption that follows in Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dwellers_of_jerusalem.htm">Dwellers of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, representing the people of God who are being called to witness and judge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The people of the southern kingdom of Judah, who are being addressed directly by God through the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is calling upon His people to judge between Him and His vineyard, symbolizing His relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>A metaphor for the nation of Israel, which God has cultivated and cared for, expecting it to produce good fruit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is delivering this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine judgment and instruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_expectation_of_fruitfulness.htm">God's Expectation of Fruitfulness</a></b><br>God has invested in His people, expecting them to bear spiritual fruit.

The phrase pivots from the vineyard song&#8217;s imagery (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>) to a direct, urgent call for response.<p>&#8226; It signals that a verdict cannot be postponed; the moment of accountability has arrived (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;And now&#8221; frames the Lord&#8217;s words as the climax of a settled case, similar to the summons in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;Come now, let us reason together&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;where mercy and justice are both on the table.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O dwellers of Jerusalem and men of Judah</b><p>&#8226; The address pinpoints the covenant community&#8212;those with Scripture, temple, and promises (<a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming both city and tribe, God embraces every social layer: leaders, priests, merchants, laborers (<a href="/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The reminder echoes <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-3</a>, where Judah is rebuked for knowing less than an ox or donkey; privilege heightens responsibility (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I exhort you</b><p>&#8226; The Lord does not merely accuse; He invites participation in the court (<a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Exhort&#8221; conveys strong urging, yet still offers grace&#8212;He wants them to see His righteousness before judgment falls (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The tone recalls <a href="/psalms/50-4.htm">Psalm 50:4-6</a>, where God summons His people to witness His justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To judge</b><p>&#8226; Judah is asked to function as jury, evaluating whether God or the nation is at fault&#8212;an appeal that exposes their own conscience (<a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The challenge anticipates objections that the LORD has been unfair (<a href="/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By putting the decision in their hands, He strips away excuses and prepares the ground for the next verse&#8217;s question, &#8220;What more was there to do&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Between Me and My vineyard</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;My vineyard&#8221; ties back to <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>: God planted, protected, and expected fruit, yet it yielded only wild grapes.<p>&#8226; The relationship is intimate&#8212;owner and possession&#8212;making the vineyard&#8217;s failure a personal affront (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later echoes this courtroom scene in the parable of the tenants (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>), where Israel likewise condemns itself by pronouncing judgment.<p>&#8226; The underlying principle: divine investment warrants fruit (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-7.htm">Hebrews 6:7-8</a>). Refusal reveals willful rebellion, not divine neglect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-3.htm">Isaiah 5:3</a> is God&#8217;s courtroom summons. Having sung the parable, He now calls His own covenant people to weigh His dealings with them. By addressing Judah directly, urging them to judge, and placing His vineyard relationship on display, He proves His care is flawless and their fruitlessness inexcusable. The verse invites honest self-examination, stripping away every defense so that God&#8217;s justice and Judah&#8217;s responsibility stand unmistakably clear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem</span>.--"The song of the vineyard" comes to an end and becomes the text of a discourse in which Jehovah, as the "Beloved" of the song, speaks through the prophet. Those to whom the parable applies are invited, as David was by Nathan, to pass an unconscious judgment on themselves. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/21-40.htm" title="When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?">Matthew 21:40-41</a>, as an instance of the same method.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The prophet's "song" here ends, and Jehovah himself takes the word.
