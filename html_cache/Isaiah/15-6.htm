The drying up of these waters symbolizes desolation and judgment upon Moab. In the ancient Near East, water sources were vital for survival, agriculture, and prosperity. The drying up of water would indicate a severe crisis, reflecting God's judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where water scarcity signifies divine retribution (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3-4</a>).<p><b>and the grass is withered</b><br>The withering of grass further emphasizes the theme of desolation. Grass, often used in the Bible to symbolize life and prosperity, withering away indicates a loss of vitality and sustenance. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7-8</a>, where the transient nature of human life is compared to grass that withers. The withering grass in Moab signifies the fading of its glory and strength under divine judgment.<p><b>the vegetation is gone</b><br>The absence of vegetation underscores the complete devastation of the land. Vegetation is essential for food, livestock, and economic stability. The loss of vegetation would lead to famine and economic collapse, highlighting the severity of the judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of land suffering due to the people's sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10-12</a>, where the land mourns due to the people's disobedience.<p><b>and the greenery is no more</b><br>The disappearance of greenery completes the picture of barrenness and ruin. Greenery often symbolizes life, growth, and prosperity. Its absence indicates a total lack of life and hope. This imagery can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of creation groaning under the weight of sin (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>) and the ultimate hope of restoration through Christ, who brings life and renewal (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The judgment on Moab serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the hope of redemption through repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nimrim.htm">Nimrim</a></b><br>A location in Moab, likely known for its water sources.

The Wady Numeira is a watercourse running into the Dead Sea from the east, hallway between the promontory called the "Lisan" and the sea's southern extremity. It is fed by "six or seven springs" ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fatal, October, 1880, p. 254) - "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills" (Tristram), and boasts along its banks a number of "well-watered gardens." There is no reason to doubt the identity of this stream with "the waters of Nimrim." Their "desolation" was probably caused by the enemy stopping up the sources (<a href="/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hay is withered away.</span> There is luxuriant vegetation in the wadys and ghors at the southern end of the Dead Sea, especially in the Ghor-es-Safiyeh, the Wady Numeira, and the Wady el-Mantara ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest.
