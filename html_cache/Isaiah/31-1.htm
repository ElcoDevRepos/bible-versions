Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation known for its military strength and resources. In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were tempted to seek Egypt's help against the Assyrian threat. This reflects a lack of faith in God's protection and provision, as seen in previous instances where Israel relied on God for deliverance, such as the Exodus (Exodus 14). The "woe" indicates impending judgment for this misplaced trust.<p><b>who rely on horses</b><br>Horses were a symbol of military power and might in ancient times. The reliance on horses signifies a dependence on human strength and military capabilities rather than divine intervention. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> warns Israel's kings not to accumulate horses, especially from Egypt, highlighting the danger of relying on military power instead of God. This reliance contrasts with the biblical theme of God as the ultimate source of strength and victory (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>who trust in their abundance of chariots</b><br>Chariots were advanced military technology in the ancient Near East, representing security and power. Trusting in chariots implies a focus on material and technological means for protection. This is contrary to the biblical teaching that true security comes from God alone (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>). The abundance of chariots suggests a false sense of security and self-reliance, which is condemned throughout scripture.<p><b>and in their multitude of horsemen</b><br>The multitude of horsemen further emphasizes reliance on military might and numbers. This reflects a common human tendency to trust in numerical superiority and human resources. However, biblical narratives, such as Gideon's victory with a small army (Judges 7), demonstrate that God often works through weakness to show His power. The emphasis on human strength is a recurring theme of misplaced trust.<p><b>They do not look to the Holy One of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual failure of the people. The "Holy One of Israel" is a title for God that emphasizes His uniqueness, holiness, and covenant relationship with Israel. By not looking to Him, the Israelites are neglecting their covenant obligations and failing to recognize God's sovereignty and ability to save. This neglect is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to various judgments and calls for repentance (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>they do not seek the LORD</b><br>Seeking the LORD involves turning to Him in faith, prayer, and obedience. The failure to seek God indicates a spiritual apathy and rebellion against His authority. Throughout scripture, seeking God is associated with blessing and deliverance (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of a relationship with God and the consequences of neglecting it. The call to seek the LORD is a central theme in the prophetic literature, urging a return to faithfulness and trust in God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful nation known for its military strength and chariots.

Egypt had once enslaved Israel; returning there for aid showed spiritual amnesia (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>). Similar rebukes appear in <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;2</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>, underscoring that leaning on worldly powers insults the God who delivers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who rely on horses</b><p>Horses symbolized military muscle (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). By Isaiah&#8217;s day, Egypt was famed for breeding and exporting them (<a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>). Judah&#8217;s royal court saw horsepower as a shortcut to security. Yet <a href="/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a> cautions, &#8220;A horse is a vain hope for salvation.&#8221; The Scriptures consistently teach that genuine safety is never engineered by human strength but granted by God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who trust in their abundance of chariots</b><p>Chariots multiplied battlefield advantage&#8212;speed, intimidation, and offensive power. Egypt&#8217;s stockpile looked impressive to anxious politicians in Jerusalem, but trust misplaced in technology is still idolatry (<a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>). God had warned Israel&#8217;s kings not to &#8220;multiply horses&#8221; or &#8220;cause the people to return to Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). Isaiah reminds them that breaking covenant boundaries invites covenant consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in their multitude of horsemen</b><p>A vast cavalry seemed to promise victory through numbers (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>). Yet Scripture counters that one plus God is always a majority. Gideon&#8217;s pared-down 300 routed Midian (<a href="/bsb/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). Jonathan and his armor-bearer routed the Philistines (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>). Numbers impress nations, but the Lord &#8220;saves, not with sword and spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They do not look to the Holy One of Israel</b><p>Here lies the heart of the issue: misplaced gaze. &#8220;Look to Me, and be saved,&#8221; God commands (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>). By consulting Egypt first, Judah broke the first commandment in practice if not profession. Earlier, Isaiah had urged, &#8220;In returning and rest you shall be saved&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>). Refusal to &#8220;look&#8221; toward the covenant Lord reveals functional atheism&#8212;even while maintaining temple rituals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they do not seek the LORD</b><p>Seeking implies relationship, dependence, and obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The prophet points out that political maneuvering replaced prayerful inquiry (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12&#8211;13</a>). <a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a> promises, &#8220;Those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.&#8221; When God&#8217;s people neglect this pursuit, He often allows their earthly confidences to crumble so their hearts return to Him (<a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a> confronts the fatal error of substituting human alliances, resources, and numbers for wholehearted trust in the Lord.

The chief point brought out, which had not distinctly appeared previously, is the value set on the horses and chariots of Egypt in the conflict with Assyria (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>; and see also the earlier prophecy, <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-6</a>). The examples of Samaria, Gaza, and Ashdod might well have taught the lesson of distrust of Egypt, without any Divine warnings (see G. Smith's 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 125-131). But the Jews were infatuated, and relied on Egypt despite her previous failures to give effective aid. <span class="cmt_word">And stay on horses</span>. The Assyrian cavalry was very numerous, and very efficient. It is often represented on the monuments. Egyptian cavalry, on the other hand, is not represented at all; and it may be questioned whether, in the early times, the Egyptian war-horses were not entirely employed in the chariot-service (see 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, p. 321). The later dynasties of Egyptian kings, however, employed cavalry, as appears from <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; Herod., 2:162; 'Records of the Past,' vol. it. pp. 68, 70, 72, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And trust in chariots, because they are many</span>. The large number of the chariots maintained by the Pharaohs is abundantly evidenced. Diodorus assigns to Sesostris twenty-seven thousand (1. 54, &sect; 4). This is, no doubt, an exaggeration; but the six hundred of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and even the one thousand two hundred of Shishak(<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) are moderate computations, quite in accord with the monuments, and with all that we otherwise know of Egyptian warfare. Egypt exported chariots to the neighboring countries (<a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and was at this time the only power which seemed capable of furnishing such a chariot-force as could hope to contend on tolerably even terms with the force of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">They look not unto the Holy One of Israel</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11, 12</a>). The trust in the Egyptian alliance was accompanied by a distrust of Jehovah and his power, and a disinclination to look to him for aid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/31-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah! alas! ha!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to those who go down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
