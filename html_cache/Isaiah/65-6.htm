In biblical times, writing was a way to ensure that something was recorded and remembered. The imagery of something being "written before" God suggests that He is fully aware and has a record of the actions and sins of the people. This aligns with the concept of divine omniscience, where God is all-knowing and nothing escapes His notice. The idea of a heavenly record is also seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, where a "scroll of remembrance" is mentioned.<p><b>I will not keep silent:</b><br>God's decision not to remain silent indicates His intention to act. In the context of Isaiah, this is a response to the persistent sin and rebellion of the people. Silence from God can sometimes be seen as a form of judgment or patience, but here, it signifies impending action. This echoes the prophetic tradition where God speaks through His prophets to warn and call His people to repentance, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>but I will repay:</b><br>The concept of repayment here is tied to divine justice. In the biblical narrative, God is portrayed as a just judge who will repay individuals and nations according to their deeds. This is consistent with the principle of retribution found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are reminded that vengeance belongs to the Lord. The repayment is not arbitrary but is based on the moral and covenantal failures of the people.<p><b>I will pay it back into their laps:</b><br>The imagery of paying back into their laps suggests a personal and direct consequence for the actions of the people. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the lap was often associated with one's personal space and possessions, indicating that the repayment will be unavoidable and intimately felt. This phrase underscores the idea that the consequences of sin are inescapable and will be experienced personally. The notion of receiving in one's lap is also seen in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where blessings are described as being poured into one's lap, highlighting the measure-for-measure principle in divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
