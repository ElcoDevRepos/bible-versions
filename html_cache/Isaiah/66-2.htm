It echoes <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The rhetorical question underscores that everything in existence is a result of God's handiwork, aligning with passages like <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which states, "The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and everything in it." This serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over creation, contrasting human efforts and achievements with divine omnipotence.<p><b>And so they came into being,&#8221; declares the LORD.</b><br>This statement affirms the reality and existence of creation as a direct act of God. It reflects the biblical theme of God speaking things into existence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God&#8217;s word brings forth creation. The phrase "declares the LORD" adds weight, indicating divine proclamation and authority. It also connects to <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, which states, "Through Him all things were made," pointing to the involvement of the Word, Jesus Christ, in creation.<p><b>This is the one I will esteem:</b><br>Here, God identifies the qualities He values in individuals. The term "esteem" suggests honor and favor, indicating that God looks beyond external rituals and appearances to the heart's condition. This aligns with <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearance. It sets the stage for understanding the characteristics that are pleasing to God.<p><b>he who is humble and contrite in spirit,</b><br>Humility and contrition are central to a right relationship with God. Humility involves recognizing one's dependence on God, while contrition implies genuine repentance and sorrow for sin. This echoes <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, where David acknowledges that a broken and contrite heart is what God desires. These qualities contrast with pride and self-reliance, which are often condemned in Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<p><b>who trembles at My word.</b><br>Trembling at God's word signifies reverence and awe for divine revelation. It implies a deep respect and willingness to obey God's commands. This attitude is seen in <a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5-6</a>, where the people stand in reverence as the Book of the Law is read. It also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of hearing and doing God's word in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>. This phrase highlights the importance of Scripture as the ultimate authority in a believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who speaks in this verse, emphasizing His authority and the qualities He values in His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, addressing the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of Isaiah's prophecy, who are being called to humility and reverence for God's word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty and Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that everything exists by God's hand and authority.

Everything in heaven and on earth exists because He fashioned it (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>). Like a loving Father pointing to the work of His own hands, He underscores His unmatched authority. When <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24&#8211;25</a> echoes that &#8220;He Himself gives all men life and breath and everything else,&#8221; it reinforces that the Lord is neither dependent on temples nor limited by human achievements. Isaiah is pressing the point: since God made all, He owns all, and every claim to self-sufficiency crumbles in His presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And so they came into being</b><p>Creation was not merely God&#8217;s idea&#8212;it materialized by His spoken word (<a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6&#8211;9</a>). <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a> reminds us that &#8220;the universe was formed at God&#8217;s command,&#8221; so visible reality rests on His invisible power. This clause rebukes any notion that human hands could build something God somehow needs. <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> praises Him because &#8220;by Your will they exist,&#8221; stressing that all of existence owes its ongoing life to His sustaining will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the one I will esteem</b><p>Amid all the grandeur He could highlight, the Lord pinpoints the kind of person who captures His delight. He &#8220;will esteem&#8221; a certain heart posture, not grand structures or rituals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10&#8211;11</a> says He &#8220;takes no pleasure in the strength of the horse&#8230; but in those who fear Him.&#8221; Jesus echoes this priority: &#8220;Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). God&#8217;s value system flips ours upside down&#8212;He honors the lowly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who is humble and contrite in spirit</b><p>Humility here is not self-hatred but clear-eyed honesty about our dependence on God. &#8220;Contrite&#8221; speaks of a heart broken over sin, like David&#8217;s &#8220;broken and contrite heart&#8221; that God &#8220;will not despise&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). Isaiah uses the same pairing in 57:15, where the High and Holy One dwells with the contrite to revive them. <a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13-14</a> illustrates it in the tax collector who beat his breast, recognized his unworthiness, and left justified. God esteems those who admit their need and turn from pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who trembles at My word</b><p>To tremble is to treat Scripture with reverent awe, recognizing it as the very voice of God. <a href="/ezra/9-4.htm">Ezra 9:4</a> describes those who &#8220;trembled at the words of the God of Israel,&#8221; gathering to confess sin. <a href="/psalms/119-120.htm">Psalm 119:120</a> confesses, &#8220;My flesh trembles in awe of You.&#8221; This is not paralyzing fear but worshipful submission: hearing, believing, and obeying without negotiation (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a> urges believers to &#8220;work out your salvation with fear and trembling,&#8221; a posture that honors the holy authority of God&#8217;s revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a> sets God&#8217;s limitless creative power beside His intimate concern for the humble. The One who made and sustains all things delights not in human monuments but in broken, repentant hearts that revere His word. He promises His special regard to those who:<p>&#8226; acknowledge His creator-rights over everything,<p>&#8226; confess their own sinfulness and need,<p>&#8226; submit to Scripture with trembling obedience.<p>Such people receive the Lord&#8217;s esteem, a privilege far greater than any earthly accolade.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">All those things . . .</span>--The sequence of thought runs thus:--God, the Maker of the universe, can need nothing that belongs to it. The most stately temple is to Him as the infinitely little. What He does delight in is something which is generically different, the spiritual life which answers to His own, the "contrite heart," which is the true correlative of His own holiness. He who offers that is a true worshipper, with or without the ritual of worship; in its absence, all worship is an abomination to the Eternal. Here 1 and 2 Isaiah are essentially one in teaching. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these things</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> heaven and earth <span class="cmt_word">hath mine hand made</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have I, Jehovah, brought into existence.
