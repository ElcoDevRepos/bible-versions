In the context of Isaiah, this is a prophetic promise to the people of Israel, who were facing exile and destruction. The "builders" symbolize those who will restore the nation, both physically and spiritually. Historically, this can be linked to the return of the exiles from Babylon under leaders like Zerubbabel and Ezra, who were instrumental in rebuilding Jerusalem and the Temple. This also foreshadows the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the cornerstone and builder of the spiritual temple, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>).<p><b>your destroyers and wreckers depart from you.</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a divine intervention where those who have caused harm and destruction will be removed. In the historical context, this refers to the end of foreign oppression, particularly the Babylonian captivity. Theologically, it reflects God's promise to protect and preserve His people, removing their enemies. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God as a deliverer, as seen in Exodus with the departure of the Egyptians. In a prophetic sense, it points to the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Christ, who defeats the spiritual enemies of humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
