In ancient times, swearing by oneself was the highest form of oath, as there was no higher authority. This reflects God's sovereignty and His ultimate authority over all creation. It parallels <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, where God swears by Himself to Abraham, underscoring the certainty of His promises.<p><b>truth has gone out from My mouth,</b><br>The declaration of truth signifies the reliability and faithfulness of God's word. In the biblical context, God's word is equated with truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). This phrase assures that what God speaks is absolute and will come to pass, reflecting His unchanging nature (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><b>a word that will not be revoked:</b><br>This highlights the irrevocability of God's decrees. Once God has spoken, His word is final and unalterable. This is consistent with <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires and succeeding in the purpose for which it was sent.<p><b>Every knee will bow before Me,</b><br>This phrase indicates universal submission to God's authority. It is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee bows to Jesus Christ, showing the fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament. It signifies the ultimate recognition of God's sovereignty by all creation, both in heaven and on earth.<p><b>every tongue will swear allegiance.</b><br>This signifies a universal confession of God's lordship. The act of swearing allegiance implies a voluntary acknowledgment of God's rule. This is further connected to <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>, where Paul reiterates this prophecy, emphasizing the inevitability of all humanity acknowledging God's dominion.

Paul cites this verse in <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a> and again in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, applying it directly to Jesus Christ: &#8220;At the name of Jesus every knee should bow.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a> pictures every creature in heaven and on earth joining the chorus.
