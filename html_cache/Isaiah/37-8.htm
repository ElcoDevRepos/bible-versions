Lachish was a significant fortified city in Judah, second only to Jerusalem. The Assyrian siege of Lachish is well-documented, including reliefs found in Sennacherib's palace in Nineveh, illustrating the city's capture. This event underscores the Assyrian military prowess and their systematic campaign against Judah. The departure from Lachish indicates a strategic shift, possibly due to military needs or threats elsewhere.<p><b>he withdrew</b><br>The withdrawal of the Rabshakeh suggests a change in military strategy or a response to new intelligence. This movement reflects the fluid nature of ancient warfare, where commanders had to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. It also indicates the importance of communication and hierarchy within the Assyrian military structure, as the Rabshakeh would have been acting under direct orders from the king.<p><b>and found the king fighting against Libnah</b><br>Libnah was another fortified city in Judah, located southwest of Jerusalem. Its mention here highlights the ongoing Assyrian campaign to subdue the region. The shift from Lachish to Libnah suggests that the Assyrians were systematically targeting key Judean strongholds. This movement also reflects the broader geopolitical context, where control of cities like Libnah was crucial for maintaining dominance over the region. The Assyrian focus on these cities demonstrates their strategy of cutting off Jerusalem from potential allies and resources.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>A high-ranking Assyrian military official and spokesman for King Sennacherib.

The step would seem to indicate a strategic movement, intended to check the march of Tirhakah's army; but in our ignorance of the topography, we can settle nothing further. By some writers Libnah has been identified with Pelusium, or some other town in the Delta of the Nile. The narrative seems, perhaps, to suggest something more than a transfer of the attack from one small fortress in Judah to another; but that is all that can be said.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rabshakeh... found the King of Assyria warring against Libnah.</span> Libnah was a town at no great distance from Lachish (<a href="/joshua/10-31.htm">Joshua 10:31</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39-42</a>). It was also near Mareshah (<a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42-44</a>), and must therefore have belonged to the more southern portion of the Shefeleh, and probably to the eastern region, where the hills sink down into the plain. The exact site is very uncertain, and still remains to be discovered. Sennacherib's object in moving upon Libnah is doubtful; but it would seem, from his monuments, that he had captured Lachish (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152), and had gone on to Libnah, as the next stronghold on the way to Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Rab-shakeh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;q&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7262.htm">Strong's 7262: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rabshakeh -- perhaps 'chief of the officers', an Assyrian military leader</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king of Assyria had left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;sa&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5265.htm">Strong's 5265: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull up, the tent-pins, start on a, journey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Lachish,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
