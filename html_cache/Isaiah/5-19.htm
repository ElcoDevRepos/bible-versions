In the context of Isaiah, these individuals are often characterized by their disbelief and mockery of God's prophets. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people are warned against hard-heartedness and unbelief, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a> and <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Let Him hurry and hasten His work so that we may see it!</b><br>The demand for God to act quickly reveals a lack of faith and understanding of God's timing. This impatience is reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness, where they frequently doubted God's provision and timing (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). Theologically, it underscores the human tendency to challenge God's sovereignty and timing, contrasting with the biblical call to trust in God's perfect plan (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>).<p><b>Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come</b><br>The title "Holy One of Israel" emphasizes God's distinctiveness and purity, a recurring theme in Isaiah. This phrase highlights the people's desire to see God's plan, yet it is spoken with a tone of skepticism. Theologically, it points to the tension between God's holiness and human sinfulness, as well as the prophetic assurance that God's plans are ultimately for the good of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p><b>so that we may know it!&#8221;</b><br>The desire to "know" God's plan can be seen as a challenge rather than a genuine pursuit of understanding. This reflects a broader biblical narrative where knowledge of God is linked to obedience and faith (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God's plan through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

(<a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>).<p>- They misread God&#8217;s restraint as weakness, ignoring His character: &#8220;The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p>- Such presumption forgets that divine timing is perfect (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And hasten His work</b><p>- Mockers treat God&#8217;s redemptive plan like a circus act to be summoned at will, reversing Creator-creature roles (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>).<p>- &#8220;His work&#8221; in Isaiah&#8217;s context includes both judgment on wickedness and mercy toward the repentant (<a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2&#8211;6</a>).<p>- They want the spectacle without the submission it demands (<a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that we may see it!</b><p>- Sight is their only criterion for belief, paralleling Thomas&#8217;s initial doubt (<a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>).<p>- Scriptures warn against living by sight alone: &#8220;We walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>- Real seeing arises from obedient trust (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come</b><p>- Isaiah frequently uses &#8220;Holy One of Israel&#8221; (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; 12:6) to underscore God&#8217;s moral purity; the scoffers mention the title yet ignore its implications.<p>- They crave God&#8217;s plan merely to scrutinize it, not to surrender to it&#8212;a posture condemned in <a href="/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13&#8211;15</a>.<p>- God&#8217;s plan is unfolding regardless of human approval (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that we may know it!</b><p>- Their definition of &#8220;know&#8221;

Their call for haste masks unbelief, treating the Holy One of Israel as a servant who must perform on cue. Scripture counters this arrogance with the assurance that God&#8217;s plan moves on His sovereign timetable, rewarding faith and punishing rebellion. The verse stands as a caution: mocking divine delay invites sudden, certain judgment, while humble trust awaits His work in reverent expectation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">That say, Let him make speed.</span>--We have here, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/17-15.htm" title="Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.">Jeremiah 17:15</a>, the very words of the wealthy scoffers of Judah.
