In the biblical context, dreams often symbolize illusions or false hopes. The imagery of a hungry man dreaming of food but waking up unsatisfied reflects the emptiness of relying on anything other than God for fulfillment. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of spiritual hunger and the need for true sustenance found in God alone, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a> and <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the bread of life.<p><b>then awakens still hungry</b><br>The awakening to reality signifies the inevitable realization of unmet desires. Historically, this can be seen as a warning to the nations surrounding Israel, who may have believed they could conquer and plunder Jerusalem. The phrase underscores the idea that human plans and ambitions, when not aligned with God's will, ultimately lead to dissatisfaction and failure. This is reminiscent of the futility of human efforts without divine blessing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>.<p><b>as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking</b><br>This part of the verse continues the theme of illusion versus reality. Thirst in the Bible often symbolizes a deep spiritual longing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>. The dream of drinking represents a false sense of satisfaction that does not endure. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, and thirst was a common and pressing concern, making this imagery particularly poignant.<p><b>then awakens faint and parched</b><br>The awakening to thirst highlights the insufficiency of dreams and illusions to meet real needs. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual emptiness without God. The physical state of being faint and parched parallels the spiritual condition of those who seek fulfillment outside of God's provision. This is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God laments that His people have forsaken Him, the fountain of living waters.<p><b>So will it be for all the many nations</b><br>This phrase serves as a prophetic declaration against the nations that oppose God's people. Historically, it refers to the Assyrian and other foreign threats against Jerusalem. The prophecy assures that despite their efforts and apparent strength, these nations will ultimately fail in their attempts to conquer Mount Zion. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>.<p><b>who go to battle against Mount Zion</b><br>Mount Zion is a significant biblical symbol representing God's presence and the spiritual center of Israel. It is often associated with Jerusalem and the temple, signifying God's dwelling place among His people. The phrase indicates that any opposition to Mount Zion is ultimately opposition to God Himself. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God defends His holy city and people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-5</a> and <a href="/zechariah/12-9.htm">Zechariah 12:9</a>. The ultimate fulfillment of God's protection and victory is found in Jesus Christ, who is the cornerstone of Zion, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a> and affirmed in <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

The rude awakening found them still empty. The lion of Judah was not to be devoured even by the strong bull of Assyria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be even as when an hungry man dreameth</span>. The melting away of the vision would involve a keen disappointment. The enemies of Israel had expected to secure a most valuable prey. They had dreamed of a rich booty when they should take the city - a booty which would reward them for all the hardships of their marches, their watches, their toils in the siege, the dangers to which they exposed themselves in the assaults. It was as if a hungry man had dreamed that he was engaged in a feast, or a thirsty man that he was drinking deep at a banquet, when suddenly he wakes up, and finds that he has been merely dreaming, and that there is no reality in his fancies. Dr. Kay quotes a passage which is much to the point from Mungo Park's journals: "No sooner had I shut my eyes than fancy would convey me to the streams and rivers of my native land. There, as I wandered along the verdant bank, I surveyed the clear streams with transport, and hastened to swallow the delightful draught; but, alas! disappointment awaked me, and I found myself a lonely captive, perishing of thirst amid the wilds of Africa." Those engaged in the siege, while themselves vanishing away, would likewise find their dreams of plunder vanish, and Would bitterly feel the disappointment. <span class="cmt_word">That fight against Mount Zion.</span> To attack Jerusalem was to fight against the mount of God, the place where Jehovah had "set his Name, "and where he condescended in some true sense to <span class="accented">dwell</span> continually.
