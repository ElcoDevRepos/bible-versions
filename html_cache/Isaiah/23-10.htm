The Nile River was known for its fertile banks, which supported abundant agriculture in Egypt. The comparison implies that the people of Tarshish should focus on cultivating their land with the same diligence and productivity as the Egyptians did along the Nile. This reflects a significant change in economic focus due to the loss of their harbor, which was central to their trade and wealth. The imagery of cultivation also suggests a return to self-sufficiency and hard work, contrasting with the previous reliance on trade.<p><b>O Daughter of Tarshish</b><br>Tarshish is often identified with a distant maritime location, possibly in the western Mediterranean, such as southern Spain. It was known for its wealth and trade, particularly in metals like silver and tin. The term "Daughter of Tarshish" personifies the city or its inhabitants, indicating a close relationship with the sea and trade. This phrase highlights the impact of the prophecy on a community that was heavily dependent on its maritime activities. The use of "daughter" may also imply vulnerability and the need for protection or guidance in the face of change.<p><b>There is no longer a harbor</b><br>The loss of the harbor signifies a dramatic end to the economic prosperity and trade that defined Tarshish. Harbors were crucial for ancient cities involved in trade, serving as points of exchange and wealth accumulation. The absence of a harbor indicates a cessation of these activities, leading to economic decline. This could be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, as prophesied by Isaiah, reflecting the broader theme of God's sovereignty over nations and their fortunes. The loss of the harbor also symbolizes the end of an era and the need for adaptation to new circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_tarshish.htm">Daughter of Tarshish</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the inhabitants or the people associated with Tarshish, a significant maritime city known for its trade and wealth.
