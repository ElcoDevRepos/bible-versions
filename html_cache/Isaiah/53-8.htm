In the context of Isaiah, this can be seen as a prophecy of the Messiah, who Christians believe is Jesus Christ. The oppression and judgment refer to the trials Jesus faced, including His arrest and the subsequent trials before Jewish and Roman authorities. These events are recorded in the Gospels, where Jesus is subjected to false accusations and an unfair trial, ultimately leading to His crucifixion. The phrase underscores the miscarriage of justice, as Jesus was innocent yet condemned.<p><b>and who can recount His descendants?</b><br>This phrase suggests the lack of physical descendants or a future generation for the suffering servant. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, having descendants was a sign of blessing and legacy. The question implies that the servant's life was cut short, preventing him from having offspring. For Christians, this is seen as a reference to Jesus, who, according to the New Testament, did not have biological children. However, spiritually, His followers are considered His descendants, as they continue His mission and teachings.<p><b>For He was cut off from the land of the living;</b><br>The phrase "cut off from the land of the living" indicates a premature and violent death. In biblical terms, being "cut off" often refers to a sudden and untimely end. This is seen as a prophecy of Jesus' crucifixion, where He was executed at a relatively young age. The phrase also connects to <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being "cut off." The imagery of being removed from the land of the living emphasizes the finality and severity of His death.<p><b>He was stricken for the transgression of My people.</b><br>This phrase reveals the purpose behind the suffering servant's affliction: it was for the transgressions of others. In the context of Isaiah, this is a substitutionary atonement, where the servant bears the punishment deserved by others. Christians interpret this as a prophecy of Jesus' sacrificial death, where He took upon Himself the sins of humanity. This concept is central to Christian theology, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, which states that Jesus bore our sins in His body on the cross. The phrase underscores the servant's role as a willing and innocent substitute for the guilty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Christians traditionally interpret as a prophecy about Jesus

oppression and judgment He was taken away</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;By oppression and judgment He was taken away&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>) pictures the Messiah swept off by an

(<a href="/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57&#8211;68</a>), and Pilate capitulated to mob pressure (<a href="/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/8-32.htm">Acts

accepting the Father&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures believers that God&#8217;s purpose can work through human injustice (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and who can recount His descendants?</b><p>&#8226; The apparent riddle underscores that, humanly speaking, Jesus left no physical heirs&#8212;crucifixion cut short any earthly line

all who believe become His spiritual children (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The question also magnifies His uniqueness; no genealogy

&#8220;Cut off&#8221; speaks of literal death, not mere suffering. <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a> foretold the Messiah would be &#8220;cut off,&#8221; and the Gospel accounts confirm His actual death&#8212;He &#8220;yielded up His spirit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-50.htm">Matthew 27:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Separation from the living fulfills the sacrificial pattern: like the Passover lamb slain outside the camp (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter preaches that God foresaw this death and reversed it by resurrection (<a

The verse, fulfilled in Jesus&#8217; trial, crucifixion, and atoning death, reassures us that even human injustice bows to God&#8217;s redemptive plan, securing salvation for all who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/53.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He was taken from prison . . .</span>--The Hebrew preposition admits of this rendering, which is adopted by many commentators, as describing the oppression and iniquitous trial which had preceded the death of the servant. It admits equally of the sense, <span class= "ital">through oppression and through judgment; </span>and, on the whole, this gives a preferable sense. The whole procedure was tainted with iniquity.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall declare his generation?</span>--The words are, perhaps, the most difficult of the whole section, and have been very differently explained: (1) "Who shall declare his life, the mystery of his birth, his eternal being?" (2) "Who shall count his spiritual offspring?" as in <a href="/psalms/22-30.htm" title="A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.">Psalm 22:30</a>. (3) "As to his generation (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>his contemporaries, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm" title="O generation, see you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to you?">Jeremiah 2:31</a>), who will consider rightly?" (4) "Who shall set forth his generation in all the intensity of their guilt?"--to say nothing of other renderings, which render the noun as "his dwelling," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the grave, or his "course of life," or his "fate." Of these (3) seems most in harmony with the context, the words that follow pointing to the fact which ought to have been considered, and was not, that though the Servant of Jehovah was smitten, it was not for his own sins, but theirs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was taken from prison and from judgment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by oppression and a judgment was he taken away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (us Dr. Kay says) "by a violence which cloaked itself under the formalities of a legal process." The Septuagint Version, which is quoted by Philip the deacon in the Acts (Isaiah 8:33), must have been derived from quite a different text.
