Bel, also known as Marduk, was the chief god of Babylon, while Nebo was the god of wisdom and writing. The imagery of these gods crouching and cowering suggests their powerlessness and impending defeat. This reflects the biblical theme of the futility of idolatry, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which contrasts the living God with lifeless idols. Historically, the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC marked the decline of these deities' influence, fulfilling prophecies of Babylon's downfall.<p><b>Their idols weigh down beasts and cattle.</b><br>The idols of Bel and Nebo, often made of heavy materials like gold and silver, were physically burdensome. This phrase highlights the irony of gods who are supposed to provide strength and support but instead become a literal burden. In contrast, the God of Israel is depicted as one who carries His people (<a href="/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3-4</a>). The imagery of idols being a burden is a critique of the futility and impotence of false gods, as they require human effort to be moved and maintained.<p><b>The images you carry are burdensome,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the human effort involved in maintaining idol worship. Unlike the God of Israel, who sustains and carries His people, these idols require human intervention. This serves as a metaphor for the spiritual burden of idolatry, which leads to weariness and spiritual exhaustion. The New Testament echoes this theme, as Jesus invites the weary to find rest in Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), contrasting the burdensome nature of false worship with the rest found in Christ.<p><b>a load to the weary animal.</b><br>The imagery of animals struggling under the weight of idols underscores the futility and absurdity of idol worship. It serves as a vivid picture of the spiritual and physical toll that idolatry takes on its adherents. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers to bear the burdens of humanity, as opposed to the idols that add to them. The weariness of the animals symbolizes the weariness of those who rely on anything other than the true God for salvation and support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bel.htm">Bel</a></b><br>A title for the Babylonian god Marduk, considered the chief deity of Babylon.

Nabu (" the Revealer") was a kind of Assyrian Hermes. Isaiah sees the idols carried off as spoil, at the command of Cyrus, a heavy burden for the beasts that drag them. An inscription recently deciphered by Sir H. Rawlinson (<span class= "ital">Journal of Asiatic Society, </span>Jan. 1880, quoted by Cheyne) presents the conduct of the conqueror under a somewhat different aspect. In that inscription he describes himself as a worshipper of Bel and Nebo, and prays to them for length of days. The king would seem from this to have been as wide in his syncretic liberalism as Alexander the Great was afterwards. How are we to reconcile the two? May we say that the prophet idealises the policy and character of the king, or that the monotheistic element which appears in his treatment of the Jews (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/36-22.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">2Chronicles 36:22-23</a>; <a href="/context/ezra/1-1.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">Ezra 1:1-2</a>) was, after all, dominant in his action, in spite of episodes like that indicated in the inscription. It is possible that the recognition of the Babylonian deities may have followed on the submission of the people, and been preceded by some rougher treatment. Anyhow the contrast makes it probable that the prophecy was not written after the inscription.<p><span class= "bld">Your carriages.</span>--Here, as elsewhere (<a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>; <a href="/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:15</a>) in the sense of things carried; <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in this case, the images of the gods, which used to be carried in solemn procession, but are now represented as packed into a load for transport.

Among the direct consequences of the victories of Cyrus will be the downfall, in a certain sense, of the Babylonian idolatry. The prophet expresses the downfall by material imagery, graphically describing the fate of the idols themselves. But we must regard him as exulting mainly in the thought of the blow that would be dealt to idolatry in general, and to the Babylonian fond of it in particular, by the substitution of the non-idolatrous and almost monotheistic Persians for the polytheistic and grossly idolatrous Babylonians, in the sovereignty of the Asiatic world. The Babylonian religion no doubt maintained itself at Babylon until and beyond the time of Alexander; but it had lost all its prestige. From the state religion of the chief empire of Western Asia, it had sunk to the position of a provincial cult. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth</span>. In the later Babylonian period, to which Isaiah's prophetic vision transports him, Bel and Nebo (if we understand by Bel, Bel-Merodach) were decidedly the two principal gods. Of the seven kings of the last dynasty, three had names in which Nebo, and two names in which Bel or Merodach, wad an element. Bel-Merodach and Nebo are the chief gods worshipped by Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar. Bel, Nebo, and Merodach are the only three Babylonian gods that receive acknowledgment from Cyrus in the so-called 'Cyrus Cylinder.' Bel is, in the Babylonian, "Bil," or "Belu," and means simply "lord." There was an ancient god of the name, one of the First Triad (Anu, Bel, and Hen or Hod), who came by degrees to be identified with Merodach, the tutelary deity of Babylon. Bel-Merodach was the <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Belus) of the Greeks and Romans, who was worshipped in the great temple of Babylon, now represented by the ruin called "<span class="accented">Babil."</span> His name forms an element in those of Bel-lush, Bel-kudur-azur, Bel-ipni. Bel-zakir-isknn, and Belshazzar, all of them kings or viceroys of either Babylonia or Assyria. Nebu was the Babylonian god of learning, and has therefore been compared to Mercury. He was the special deity of Borsippa. The name is thought to be etymologically connected with the Hebrew <span class="accented">nabi</span>, prophet. The "bowing" and "stooping" of Bel and Nebo has primary reference to the overthrow of their images by the conqueror; but includes also the idea of the fall of the gods themselves in the opinions of men. <span class="cmt_word">Their idols were upon the beasts</span>. The Chaldean images generally - not only those of Bel-Merodach and Nebo, but also of Ann, and Hen, and Beltis, and Ishtar, and Nergal, and Sin, and Shamas, and Gula, and others - would be torn from their shrines, and placed upon the backs of beasts of burden, to be carried off by the conquerors. No doubt this was the case with a large number of the images, which were among the most precious of the spoils seized by the soldiers. But it appears that numerous exceptions were made. Neither Cyrus nor Cambyses touched the famous golden image of Bel-Merodach at Babylon, which was first carried off from the great temple by Xerxes (Herod., 1:183). Cyrus, moreover, restored various idols, which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon from provincial towns, to the temples to which they of right belonged (<span class="accented">Journal of Royal Asiatic Society</span>, January, 1880, art. it.). But though their fate was in tiffs way often delayed, ultimately it is probable every valuable idol was carried off and committed to the melting-pot. <span class="cmt_word">Your carriages were heavy loaden</span>;
