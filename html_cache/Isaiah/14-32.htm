In the context of Isaiah, the "envoys" could represent foreign nations witnessing the downfall of Babylon and the rise of God's kingdom. Historically, envoys were sent to gather intelligence or form alliances, and this question implies a divine message to be delivered. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over nations and His ultimate plan for His people.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has founded Zion,</b><br>Zion is a term often used to refer to Jerusalem, the city of David, and by extension, the people of God. The founding of Zion by the LORD signifies divine establishment and protection. Biblically, Zion is seen as the spiritual center of God's kingdom, a place of worship and divine presence. This phrase connects to other scriptures that highlight Zion as a symbol of God's eternal covenant with His people (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).<p><b>where His afflicted people will find refuge.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse offers hope and assurance to those who are suffering or oppressed. The "afflicted people" refers to the Israelites who have endured hardship and exile. The promise of refuge in Zion is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing God's protection and salvation (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). It also points to the ultimate refuge found in Jesus Christ, who offers rest and salvation to all who are weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). This assurance of refuge is both a present reality and a future hope for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD

alliances, the prophet offers God&#8217;s own reply.<p>&#8226; The moment reminds us that when nations seek reassurance, the true response is always God-centered (cf. <a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14-20</a>, where Hezekiah spreads an enemy letter before the LORD).<p>&#8226; By directing the envoys to listen to God&#8217;s word, Isaiah reaffirms that every earthly inquiry ultimately meets a divine answer (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The LORD has founded

127:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The line also previews the coming Messiah, the ultimate foundation stone in Zion (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter

It seems not improbable, indeed, that the series of prophecies that follow were delivered in answer to such inquiries. The fame of the prophet had spread beyond the confines of Israel, and men of different nations came to Jerusalem to consult him. So Jeremiah's oracles are delivered to the ambassadors who came to propose an alliance against Nebuchadnezzar in the time of Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). Commonly, however, the words are referred to the embassies of congratulation, which came with plans of new alliances after the destruction of Sennacherib's army (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm" title="And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.">2Chronicles 32:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That the Lord hath founded Zion.</span>--This is the answer to all such inquiries. Zion stands firm and safe in the protection of Jehovah. The "poor" (obviously those of <a href="/isaiah/14-30.htm" title="And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.">Isaiah 14:30</a>) shall trust (better, <span class= "ital">shall find refuge</span>) in it.
