The Israelites were instructed to worship at the temple in Jerusalem, but they frequently fell into the practice of using high places for idolatrous worship, which was condemned by God (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-11</a>). The use of high places is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing rebellion against God's prescribed way of worship.<p><b>you have made your bed</b><br>This phrase metaphorically describes Israel's unfaithfulness to God, likening it to an adulterous relationship. The imagery of making a bed suggests preparation and intent, indicating a deliberate choice to engage in idolatry. This metaphor is used throughout the prophets to describe Israel's spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3.htm">Jeremiah 3:1-2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a>).<p><b>and there you went up</b><br>The act of going up to these high places signifies a willful ascent into sin. It reflects a conscious decision to pursue idolatrous practices despite knowing God's commandments. This ascent is not just physical but also spiritual, representing a turning away from God.<p><b>to offer sacrifices</b><br>Sacrifices were a central part of worship in ancient Israel, intended to honor God and seek atonement. However, offering sacrifices on high places was a perversion of true worship, as it was often directed to false gods or conducted in a manner contrary to God's law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>). This practice is condemned throughout the prophetic books as a sign of Israel's infidelity and disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_and_lofty_hill.htm">High and Lofty Hill</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, high places were often used for idol worship and pagan rituals. These locations were elevated physically and symbolically, representing a place where people sought to connect with deities other than the God of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The act of offering sacrifices was central to worship in ancient times. In this context, it refers to the offerings made to idols, which were a direct violation of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah.

Jeremiah rebuked the same impulse: &#8220;She has committed adultery on every high hill and under every green tree&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting shows how sin often masquerades as something impressive&#8212;height, grandeur, visibility&#8212;yet it is rebellion cloaked in religion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have made your bed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Made your bed&#8221; is the language of intimacy. Isaiah exposes spiritual adultery: God&#8217;s covenant people literally prepared a resting place for idol worship, just as an unfaithful spouse prepares for an illicit affair (<a href="/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The bed is &#8220;made,&#8221; not accidental. Sin is deliberate, prepared, and embraced. <a href="/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a> echoes the same premeditation in adultery: &#8220;I have perfumed my bed&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The image warns that idolatry is not merely wrong doctrine; it is unfaithfulness of the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there you went up</b><p>&#8226; The pilgrim ascent should have led to Jerusalem&#8217;s temple (<a href="/psalms/122-4.htm">Psalm 122:4</a>), yet they climbed toward a counterfeit. <a href="/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a> captures the same stubborn choice: &#8220;Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more!&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Went up&#8221; underscores personal responsibility.

On the hill, the same outward act became detestable idolatry (<a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later identifies pagan sacrifices with demons (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19-20</a>). What seems spiritual can be spiritually fatal when divorced from obedience.<p>&#8226; Isaiah therefore confronts the tragedy: devotion, time, and animals were expended&#8212;not in covenant worship, but in covenant betrayal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/57-7.htm">Isaiah 57:7</a> exposes Israel&#8217;s heart: they intentionally climbed visible, impressive heights, prepared a place of intimacy with idols, and poured out sacrifices that belonged to God alone. The verse stands as a timeless warning. External religion cannot mask an unfaithful heart, and no elevation&#8212;literal or symbolic&#8212;can substitute for humble obedience to the Lord who alone is worthy of our worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Set thy bed . . .</span>--Idolatry being as adultery, the "bed" follows naturally as representing the locality of the idol-worship.
