In the context of Isaiah, "that day" often points to a future moment when God will act decisively on behalf of His people. It is a prophetic term that can refer to both immediate historical events and eschatological fulfillment. In this chapter, it likely refers to the end of Assyrian oppression over Israel.<p><b>the burden will be lifted from your shoulders</b><br>The "burden" symbolizes the oppressive rule and heavy taxation imposed by the Assyrians. Historically, the Assyrian Empire was known for its harsh treatment of conquered peoples. The lifting of this burden signifies liberation and relief, a theme consistent with God's deliverance of Israel throughout the Old Testament, such as the Exodus from Egypt.<p><b>and the yoke from your neck</b><br>The "yoke" is a metaphor for subjugation and control, often used in the Bible to describe slavery or servitude. In ancient times, a yoke was a wooden beam used to harness animals for work, symbolizing forced labor. The removal of the yoke indicates freedom from foreign domination, echoing God's promise to break the chains of bondage for His people.<p><b>The yoke will be broken</b><br>This breaking of the yoke signifies a complete and decisive end to oppression. It is not merely removed but destroyed, ensuring that the oppressor cannot reassert control. This imagery is reminiscent of God's power to shatter the instruments of bondage, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a>, where God promises to break the yoke of the Assyrians.<p><b>because your neck will be too large</b><br>This phrase suggests growth and strength, implying that the people of Israel will become too strong to be subdued again. It can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual and national renewal, where God's people are empowered and enlarged by His blessing. This transformation is a type of the ultimate victory and freedom found in Jesus Christ, who breaks the yoke of sin and death for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Most commentators, however, render "by reason of the fat," the implied figure being that of a bullock which grows so fat that the yoke will no longer go round his neck, as the symbol of a people waxing strong and asserting its freedom.
