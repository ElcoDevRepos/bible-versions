href="/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a> promises that at God&#8217;s appointed time even distant, formidable Cush will honor Him with gifts in Jerusalem. The verse blends near-term historical fulfillment with a larger prophetic canvas in which every nation&#8212;no matter its power, appearance, language, or geography&#8212;turns to acknowledge the LORD of Hosts on Mount Zion. The scene previews the global worship that Scripture consistently declares, assuring believers that God&#8217;s redemptive plan reaches the ends of the earth and culminates in His glory established in Zion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">In that time shall the present be brought . . .</span>--Not "of the people," but <span class= "ital">a people, </span>as being themselves the present. The prophet foresees, as one result of the defeat of the Assyrian armies, that the nation, which he again describes instead of naming, will offer themselves to the service of Jehovah. So taken the words have an interesting parallel in <a href="/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>, "Ethiopia stretches out her hands unto God," or in the mention of Ethiopia in <a href="/psalms/87-3.htm" title="Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.">Psalm 87:3</a>, as among the nations whose children are to be enrolled among the citizens of Zion. Messengers who may have justified Isaiah's words were probably found among the envoys mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm" title="And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.">2Chronicles 32:23</a>.

It would not be at all improbable that Tirkakah should, after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, send a gift to the temple of the Jews, either as a recognition of the miracle as wrought by Jehovah, or simply as a thank offering. Necho sent the armor in which he had fought at Megiddo to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, near Miletus, as a thank offering (Herod., 2:159). We have, however, no historical record of Tirkakah's present as sent. <span class="cmt_word">Of a people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from a people</span> (compare the next clause, which supplies the ellipse of the preposition).
