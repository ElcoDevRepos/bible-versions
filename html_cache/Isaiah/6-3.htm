The repetition of their calling emphasizes the continuous and communal nature of their worship. In the context of ancient Near Eastern culture, communal worship was a significant aspect of religious practice, reflecting unity and shared reverence. The seraphim's call to one another signifies the importance of collective acknowledgment of God's holiness.<p><b>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts;</b><br>The thrice-repeated "holy" underscores the absolute and perfect holiness of God, a concept central to the understanding of God's nature in the Bible. The repetition is a Hebrew literary device used for emphasis, indicating the completeness and superlative nature of God's holiness. The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's sovereignty over the heavenly armies, highlighting His supreme authority and power. This phrase connects to <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, where the same declaration is made, showing continuity in the depiction of God's holiness throughout Scripture.<p><b>all the earth is full of His glory.</b><br>This statement reflects the belief that God's presence and majesty are evident throughout creation. The earth, as part of God's creation, is a testament to His glory, which is a recurring theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>). The phrase also anticipates the eschatological vision where God's glory will be fully realized and acknowledged by all creation, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>. This prophetic vision points to the ultimate fulfillment in the new creation, where God's glory will be fully manifest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Viewed from the standpoint of a later revelation, devout thinkers have naturally seen in it an allusive reference to the glory of Jehovah as seen alike in the past, the present, and the future, which seems the leading idea in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>, or even a faint foreshadowing of the Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead. Historically we cannot separate it from the name of the Holy One of Israel, which with "the Lord of hosts" was afterwards so prominent in Isaiah's teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One cried</span>; rather, <span class="accented">kept crying</span> (comp. <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, "They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"). But the prophet scarcely goes so far; he describes only his vision - they did not rest while the vision was vouchsafed him. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy</span>. The Church on earth has taken pattern by the Church above; and the "Trisagion" is ever being repeated in one part of the earth or another without ceasing: "Thou continuest holy, O thou Worship of Israel." There is no attribute so essential to God as this. It is for his holiness, more than for anything else, that his creatures worship him. The triple repetition has been understood in all ages of the Church as connected with the doctrine of the Trinity. Holy is he who has created us, and bidden us worship him in the beauty of holiness Holy is he who has redeemed us, and washed away our sins, and made us by profession holy! Holy is he who day by day sanctifies us, and makes us in very deed and truth, so far as we will permit him, holy! <span class="cmt_word">The whole earth is full of his glory</span>. Even in heaven the seraphic thoughts are turned to earth, and its relation to its Divine Creator is made the subject of angelic utterances (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). The lesson which they gather from their contemplation, even under all the miserable circumstances of the time, is a cheering one: "The whole earth is full of God's glory." Men, whether they will it or not, are working out God's purposes, advancing his designs, accomplishing the ends that he desires (see Homiletics on Isaiah 5:25-29). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;q&#257;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
