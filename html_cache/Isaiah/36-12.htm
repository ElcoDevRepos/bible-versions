His role was to deliver messages and negotiate terms, often using psychological warfare. This encounter occurs during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, a critical moment in the history of Judah. The Rabshakeh's reply is part of a larger dialogue intended to intimidate and demoralize the people of Jerusalem.<p><b>Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master</b><br>The "master" refers to King Sennacherib, and "your master" refers to King Hezekiah of Judah. The Rabshakeh's question implies that his message is not just for the leaders but for all the people, aiming to spread fear and doubt. This tactic is consistent with Assyrian military strategy, which often involved psychological operations to weaken enemy morale before physical confrontation.<p><b>and not to the men sitting on the wall</b><br>The men on the wall are the soldiers and citizens of Jerusalem who are directly involved in the city's defense. The wall represents the last line of defense against the Assyrian siege. By addressing them, the Rabshakeh seeks to undermine their confidence in Hezekiah's leadership and in God's protection, hoping to incite panic and surrender.<p><b>who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine</b><br>This graphic imagery highlights the desperation and dire conditions of a prolonged siege, where food and water become scarce. Such conditions were not uncommon in ancient warfare, and the Rabshakeh uses this vivid language to emphasize the futility of resistance. The threat of starvation and degradation is meant to break the will of the defenders. This phrase also serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>, where similar curses are described for those who turn away from the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander sent by King Sennacherib to deliver a message to King Hezekiah of Judah.
