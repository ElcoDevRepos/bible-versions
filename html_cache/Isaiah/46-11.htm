The "bird of prey" symbolizes a swift and powerful conqueror, often interpreted as Cyrus the Great of Persia. Historically, Cyrus came from the east of Babylon, aligning with this imagery. The use of "bird of prey" emphasizes the speed and decisiveness of his conquest. This aligns with God's use of foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar is called God's servant.<p><b>a man for My purpose from a far-off land</b><br>Cyrus is again the likely reference here, as he was raised by God to fulfill His purpose of liberating the Israelites from Babylonian captivity. This highlights the theme of divine providence, where God uses individuals, regardless of their knowledge of Him, to fulfill His plans. The "far-off land" underscores the distance and unexpected nature of God's chosen instrument, reflecting the idea that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>Truly I have spoken, and truly I will bring it to pass</b><br>This emphasizes God's faithfulness and the certainty of His word. When God declares something, it is as good as done, reflecting His omnipotence and reliability. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, where it is stated that God does not lie or change His mind. The fulfillment of prophecy serves as a testament to God's unchanging nature and His control over history.<p><b>I have planned it, and I will surely do it</b><br>This phrase underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and predestination. God's plans are not thwarted by human actions or circumstances. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that God's purposes are established from eternity (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). The certainty of God's plans provides comfort and assurance to believers, knowing that God's will is ultimately for their good and His glory (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bird_of_prey.htm">Bird of Prey</a></b><br>Symbolically represents a swift and decisive agent of God's will.

There is no need to suppose any allusion to the fact, if fact it be, that the Persians from the time of Cyrus had for a standard a golden eagle, with wings outspread, on the top of a spear-shaft (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:1, &sect; 4; 'Anab.,' 1:10, &sect; 12).

Both Persia and Susiana, which were the primary seats of the power of Cyrus, lay to the east of Babylon, the latter due east, the former somewhat to the south-east. Even Media might, according to Hebrew usage, be described as east, though lying almost due north-east. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/46-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I summon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a bird of prey</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#183;yi&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5861.htm">Strong's 5861: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hawk, other bird of prey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the east,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;miz&#183;r&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
