In <a href="/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>, the prophet speaks to Jerusalem, also referred to as Ariel, predicting a time when the city will be humbled due to its disobedience and spiritual blindness. This humbling is a common theme in the Old Testament, where God often brings down the proud to demonstrate His sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>). The imagery of being brought low can also be seen as a precursor to repentance and restoration, a cycle frequently observed in Israel's history.<p><b>you will speak from the ground</b><br>Speaking from the ground suggests a position of defeat or death, as if the city or its people are so low that their voices come from the grave. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual deadness of the people, who have turned away from God. The imagery evokes the idea of Sheol, the Hebrew concept of the underworld, where the dead reside (<a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>). It underscores the severity of the judgment that will befall them, yet also hints at the possibility of resurrection or renewal, as God often uses such imagery to bring about a deeper spiritual awakening.<p><b>and out of the dust your words will be muffled</b><br>The muffled words from the dust suggest a lack of clarity or power in communication, symbolizing the ineffectiveness and futility of the people's current state. Dust is often associated with mortality and humility in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a reflection of the people's inability to reach God due to their sin, as their prayers and cries are muted by their disobedience. It serves as a call to repentance, urging them to seek God earnestly so their voices may be heard clearly once more.<p><b>Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground</b><br>This phrase evokes the image of a ghostly or ethereal voice, further emphasizing the theme of death and spiritual desolation. In biblical times, spirits or shades were thought to inhabit Sheol, and their voices were faint and powerless. This imagery highlights the separation between the people and God, as their spiritual state renders them as ineffective as the shades of the dead. It also serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God, as their once vibrant relationship with Him has become ghostly and insubstantial.<p><b>your speech will whisper out of the dust</b><br>The whispering speech signifies weakness and the inability to assert oneself, reflecting the diminished state of the people. Dust, again, symbolizes mortality and the transient nature of human life (<a href="/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a>). This phrase can be seen as a call to humility, reminding the people of their dependence on God for strength and vitality. It also points to the hope of restoration, as God often uses such imagery to bring about a transformation, turning whispers into proclamations of faith and renewal. The whispering from the dust can be seen as a precursor to the resurrection power that is fully realized in Jesus Christ, who brings life from death and clarity from confusion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The phrase pictures literal siege and humiliation.<p>- Other prophets echo this sober theme: &#8220;The pride of mankind will be humbled&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>); &#8220;A man&#8217;s pride will bring him low&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s pattern is consistent: when His people exalt themselves, He intervenes to bring them down so they might look up (<a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will speak from the ground</b><p>- Under siege, Jerusalem&#8217;s survivors would be so weakened that their cries would seem to come from the very soil they cling to for cover.<p>- Scripture often links desperate prayer with being laid low in the earth: &#8220;Our soul has sunk to the dust&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>) and &#8220;Remember that You made me from clay&#8221; (<a href="/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a>).<p>- The image is both literal&#8212;bodies pressed to the ground&#8212;and spiritual&#8212;hearts finally acknowledging total dependence on the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Out of the dust your words will be muffled</b><p>- Dust absorbs and softens sound; Isaiah pictures stifled, barely audible pleas.<p>- Job sat &#8220;in dust and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>) when broken before God. The exiles later confessed, &#8220;We lie prostrate in the dust; our bodies cling to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>), mirroring Isaiah&#8217;s forecast.<p>- God allows muffled cries so His people recognize that no human strategy can rescue them&#8212;only His mercy can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper out of the dust</b><p>- The comparison to a faint, ghost-like whisper heightens the sense of powerlessness. Just as Saul sought a medium and heard a &#8220;spirit coming up out of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm">1 Samuel 28:13&#8211;14</a>), Jerusalem&#8217;s once-confident voice would be reduced to a weak murmur.<p>- Isaiah&#8217;s contrast is stark: the city that once roared with worship and commerce would sound like the subdued moan of the grave (<a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>).<p>- Yet even whispers reach God. &#8220;A bruised reed He will not break&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>). The remnant&#8217;s faint prayers would set the stage for future restoration (<a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a> foretells a literal, devastating humbling of Jerusalem. The proud city will be pressed so low that its remaining voice resembles a weak, dusty whisper from the grave. God engineers this abasement to expose false confidence and invite genuine repentance. Though judgment is severe, the passage hints at hope: even the softest cry, uttered from the dust, is heard by the Lord who later promises to revive and redeem His humbled people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Shalt speak out of the ground.</span>--The words paint the panic of the besieged, the words pointing probably to Sennacherib's invasion. They spoke in whispers, like the voice of the spectres which men heard in the secret chambers of the soothsayers.

(See Note on <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy speech shall be low</span>.
