The concept of retribution is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God is portrayed as a righteous judge. This aligns with passages such as <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, which states that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." The idea of deeds being repaid is also seen in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>, reinforcing the consistency of God's justice throughout scripture.<p><b>fury to His enemies,</b><br>The term "fury" indicates intense anger and is often associated with God's righteous indignation against sin and rebellion. In the context of Isaiah, God's enemies are those who oppose His will and oppress His people. This reflects the broader theme of divine warfare found in the prophetic books, where God acts as a warrior against those who threaten His covenant community. The imagery of divine fury is also present in <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>, where God is described as avenging and wrathful.<p><b>retribution to His foes,</b><br>Retribution here refers to the just punishment that God administers to those who are hostile towards Him. This concept is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience and disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The foes of God are not only external enemies but also those within Israel who have turned away from Him. This dual aspect of retribution is seen in the prophetic literature, where both foreign nations and unfaithful Israelites are subject to God's judgment.<p><b>and recompense to the islands.</b><br>The mention of "islands" or "coastlands" extends the scope of God's judgment beyond Israel to the distant nations. This reflects the universal aspect of God's sovereignty and justice. In the ancient Near Eastern context, islands often represented the farthest reaches of the known world, indicating that no place is beyond God's reach. This theme is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, where the coastlands wait for God's law, highlighting the global impact of His justice and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (He)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the righteous judge who will repay according to deeds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_and_foes.htm">Enemies and Foes</a></b><br>These are those who oppose God and His ways, representing both individuals and nations that act against His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/islands.htm">Islands</a></b><br>Symbolically refers to distant lands or nations, indicating the universal scope of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God is a just judge who will repay each according to their deeds.
