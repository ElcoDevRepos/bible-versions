It is a common introduction in prophetic literature, underscoring that the following words are not merely human opinion but a revelation from God Himself. This establishes the seriousness and reliability of the message.<p><b>As the new wine is found in a cluster of grapes,</b><br>The imagery of new wine in a cluster of grapes symbolizes potential and promise. In ancient Israel, wine was a staple of daily life and a symbol of joy and blessing. The reference to a cluster suggests abundance and the idea that within something seemingly ordinary, there is something valuable. This metaphor is used to illustrate God's discernment and care in preserving what is good.<p><b>and men say, &#8216;Do not destroy it, for it contains a blessing,&#8217;</b><br>This reflects a common practice in viticulture where a cluster of grapes, though part of a larger harvest, is preserved because it holds potential for producing good wine. The phrase indicates human recognition of value and blessing, paralleling God's recognition of the faithful remnant among His people. It suggests that even in judgment, God is attentive to preserving those who are righteous.<p><b>so I will act on behalf of My servants;</b><br>God's promise to act on behalf of His servants highlights His faithfulness and commitment to those who serve Him. This is a reassurance of divine protection and favor, reminiscent of God's covenant promises throughout the Old Testament. It underscores the theme of a remnant, a faithful group preserved by God despite widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>I will not destroy them all.</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's mercy and justice. While judgment is inevitable due to sin, God promises not to completely destroy His people. This reflects the biblical theme of a remnant, where God preserves a portion of His people to fulfill His purposes. It connects to other scriptures where God spares a remnant, such as in the stories of Noah and Lot, and foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, declaring His intentions and plans for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, through whom God communicates His messages to the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_the_lord.htm">Servants of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful remnant of Israel who remain obedient and loyal to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cluster_of_grapes.htm">Cluster of Grapes</a></b><br>A metaphor used to illustrate the presence of something valuable and blessed within a larger context that might otherwise be discarded.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_wine.htm">New Wine</a></b><br>Symbolizes the potential and blessing found within the faithful remnant, akin to the valuable juice within the grapes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy_and_justice.htm">God's Mercy and Justice</a></b><br>God is both just and merciful, choosing to preserve the faithful remnant even when judgment is warranted for the larger group.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_the_faithful_remnant.htm">Value of the Faithful Remnant</a></b><br>Like the new wine in a cluster, the faithful are precious to God and can bring blessings to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers can find hope in God's promises to act on behalf of His servants, ensuring that faithfulness is rewarded.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_advocacy.htm">Intercession and Advocacy</a></b><br>Just as the presence of the faithful can lead to preservation, believers are called to intercede for others and advocate for righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_a_blessing.htm">Living as a Blessing</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to live in such a way that they are a blessing to their communities, reflecting God's grace and truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_65_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 65:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_65_8_Mercy_in_Judgment.htm">How does Isaiah 65:8 illustrate God's mercy amidst judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_new_wine_in_a_cluster.htm">What does "new wine is found in a cluster" symbolize in Isaiah 65:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_65_8_inspire_us_today.htm">How can Isaiah 65:8 encourage us to seek God's preservation today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_65_8_to_God_s_mercy_verse.htm">Connect Isaiah 65:8 with another scripture about God's mercy and protection.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_sparing_the_remnant.htm">How can we apply the principle of sparing the remnant in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_65_8_on_God_s_mercy_to_sinners.htm">What does Isaiah 65:8 reveal about God's mercy towards sinners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_65_8_Divine_patience_shown.htm">How does Isaiah 65:8 illustrate the concept of divine patience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Isaiah_65_8_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message in Isaiah 65:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_65.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 65?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_foods_are_mentioned_in_the_bible.htm">What foods are mentioned in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_isaiah_25_6_align_with_israel's_exclusivity.htm">How does Isaiah 25:6, which speaks of a universal feast for all peoples, align with other Old Testament passages emphasizing Israel's exclusivity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_amos_9_13's_prophecy_literal_or_symbolic.htm">Amos 9:13 -

The words "destroy it not" are those which stand at the head of Psalms 57-59, as indicating the tune to which they were to be sung; and it is a natural inference that it may have been a popular vintage song, and therefore doubly apt for the prophet's purpose. May we compare our own song of "Wood-man, spare that tree?" applied, as it has been, to the trees of ancient institutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - SALVATION PROMISED TO A REMNANT. In Isaiah, and especially in the "Book of Consolation" (<a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.), promises are almost always intermingled with threatenings. The threats extend to the bulk of the nation; the promises are limited to "a remnant," since a remnant only could be brought to "seek" and serve God (ver. 10). Here the announcement that a remnant would be spared is introduced by a simile from men's treatment of their own vineyards (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the new wine is found in the cluster</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">when new wine is found in a grape-bunch</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as when even a single cluster of grapes is spied on a vine-stem, the vine-pruners say one to another, "Destroy not that stem, but spare it," so will God refrain from destroying those stocks in his vineyard, which give even a small promise of bearing good fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Destroy it not</span>.
