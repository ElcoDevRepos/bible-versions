Historically, walls were crucial for protection and symbolized strength and security. The involvement of foreigners suggests a reversal of fortunes, where those who were once enemies or outsiders become allies and supporters. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to restore Israel, as seen in other prophetic books like Nehemiah, where non-Israelites played a role in rebuilding efforts. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>and their kings will serve you</b><br>This phrase highlights the submission of foreign rulers to Israel, indicating a shift in power dynamics. Historically, Israel was often subject to foreign domination, but this prophecy envisions a time when even kings will acknowledge and serve the purposes of God's people. This can be connected to the messianic expectation of a future king from David's line who will rule over all nations, as seen in Psalms and Revelation. It reflects the ultimate sovereignty of God over all earthly powers and the future establishment of His kingdom.<p><b>Although I struck you in anger</b><br>This acknowledges the period of judgment and discipline that Israel experienced due to their disobedience and idolatry. The Babylonian exile is a prime example of this divine anger, where God allowed foreign nations to conquer and exile His people. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's holiness and justice, where sin has consequences. However, it also sets the stage for the following promise of mercy, showing that God's anger is not His final word.<p><b>yet in favor I will show you mercy</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's grace and compassion, highlighting His willingness to forgive and restore His people despite their past transgressions. The concept of divine mercy is central to the biblical narrative, where God's covenant love remains steadfast. This promise of mercy is seen throughout the prophets and is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's favor and offers redemption to all. It reassures believers of God's unchanging character and His commitment to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelite people who will contribute to the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, symbolizing the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>Rulers of other nations who will serve Israel, indicating a reversal of fortunes and the exaltation of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city whose walls are to be rebuilt, representing the restoration and future glory of God's chosen city.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_anger_and_mercy.htm">God's Anger and Mercy</a></b><br>The dual aspects of God's relationship with Israel, highlighting His righteous judgment and compassionate restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebuilding.htm">Rebuilding</a></b><br>The act of restoring what was broken, symbolizing renewal and hope for the future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_restoration.htm">God's Sovereignty in Restoration</a></b><br>God orchestrates the restoration of His people, using even those outside the covenant community to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_gentiles_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Gentiles in God's Plan</a></b><br>The inclusion of foreigners in rebuilding signifies the universal scope of God's redemptive plan, inviting all to participate in His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_mercy_following_judgment.htm">Divine Mercy Following Judgment</a></b><br>God's anger is not His final word;
