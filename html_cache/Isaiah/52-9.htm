In the context of Isaiah, it signifies a turning point from despair to hope. The joy is not just an emotional response but a prophetic declaration of God's intervention. This joy is often associated with the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a>, which also calls for a joyful noise to the Lord. The joy here is anticipatory, looking forward to the restoration and redemption that God has promised.<p><b>Sing together</b><br>The call to sing together emphasizes unity and collective worship. In ancient Israel, singing was a communal activity, often used in worship and celebration. This phrase suggests a communal acknowledgment of God's faithfulness and deliverance. It reflects the cultural importance of music and song in expressing faith and gratitude, as seen in the Psalms and other parts of the Old Testament. Singing together also symbolizes the restoration of community and fellowship among God's people.<p><b>O ruins of Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the current state of Jerusalem as desolate and in ruins, likely referring to the aftermath of the Babylonian exile. The ruins symbolize the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the resulting judgment. However, the mention of ruins also sets the stage for God's redemptive work. The physical state of Jerusalem serves as a backdrop for the spiritual renewal and restoration that God promises. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic books, such as Lamentations, which mourns the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>For the LORD has comforted His people</b><br>The comfort mentioned here is a divine reassurance and consolation. It reflects God's compassion and mercy towards His people, who have suffered due to their sins and the resulting exile. This comfort is not just emotional but also involves tangible actions of restoration and redemption. The theme of divine comfort is prevalent throughout Isaiah, particularly in chapters 40-66, where God promises to restore and renew His covenant with Israel. This comfort is also a precursor to the ultimate comfort found in the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>He has redeemed Jerusalem</b><br>Redemption here refers to God's act of delivering and restoring Jerusalem. In the biblical context, redemption often involves a price being paid to free someone from bondage or captivity. This phrase signifies God's intervention to restore Jerusalem to its former glory and spiritual significance. The concept of redemption is central to the biblical narrative, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ. The redemption of Jerusalem is both a physical and spiritual renewal, pointing to the future hope of a new Jerusalem as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, often symbolizing the spiritual center of God's people.
