In the context of Isaiah, God is contrasting His power and sovereignty with the impotence of idols. The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the futility of these idols. Biblically, this echoes the theme found in <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, where idols are described as having mouths but not speaking, eyes but not seeing, highlighting their lifelessness and ineffectiveness.<p><b>and your work is of no value</b><br>The "work" refers to the actions and supposed miracles attributed to these idols, which are ultimately worthless. Historically, the surrounding nations of Israel, such as Babylon and Assyria, were known for their idol worship, often attributing their military and economic successes to these deities. However, God declares these works as having no real value or power. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that true power and creation belong to God alone, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the sole creator of the heavens and the earth.<p><b>Anyone who chooses you is detestable</b><br>Choosing idols over God is described as detestable, indicating a moral and spiritual corruption. This aligns with the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, "You shall have no other gods before Me," underscoring the exclusivity of worship that God demands. The term "detestable" is often used in the Old Testament to describe practices that are abominable to God, such as idolatry and child sacrifice (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). This phrase serves as a warning to the Israelites and a call to remain faithful to the covenant relationship with God, who is the only true source of life and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
