In the context of <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, the prophecy is directed against Babylon, a powerful empire known for its opulence and military might. The imagery of being "caught" and "stabbed" signifies the inescapable and violent nature of divine retribution. Historically, Babylon was a dominant force, but this prophecy foretells its downfall, which occurred when the Medes and Persians conquered it in 539 BC. The use of "stabbed" indicates a personal and direct form of violence, emphasizing the totality of the destruction. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's justice, as Babylon was known for its cruelty and oppression, particularly against the Israelites.<p><b>and whoever is captured will die by the sword</b><br>The continuation of the prophecy underscores the inevitability of death for those who are captured. The "sword" is a common biblical symbol for war and divine judgment. This phrase highlights the completeness of the judgment against Babylon, leaving no room for escape or mercy. The historical context of the Babylonian conquest by the Medes and Persians aligns with this prophecy, as the city fell swiftly and decisively. In a broader biblical context, the sword is often associated with God's judgment against sin and rebellion, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>. This serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine justice. Theologically, it points to the ultimate judgment that will come upon the world, drawing a parallel to the final judgment described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
