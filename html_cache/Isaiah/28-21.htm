Mount Perazim is associated with the battle where David defeated the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). The name "Perazim" means "breakthroughs," signifying God's powerful intervention. This serves as a reminder of God's ability to act mightily and unexpectedly in human affairs, emphasizing His sovereignty and power.<p><b>He will rouse Himself as in the Valley of Gibeon,</b><br>The Valley of Gibeon recalls another significant victory for Israel, where God intervened by causing the sun to stand still, allowing Joshua to defeat the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-14</a>). This event underscores God's control over creation and His willingness to fight for His people. It highlights the theme of divine intervention in battles, symbolizing God's active role in the deliverance and judgment of nations.<p><b>to do His work, His strange work,</b><br>The "strange work" refers to God's actions that may seem unusual or unexpected from a human perspective. In the context of Isaiah, this likely points to God's judgment on Israel, which was unexpected for a people who considered themselves chosen and protected. This phrase suggests that God's ways and purposes can be beyond human understanding, aligning with passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, which speak of God's thoughts and ways being higher than ours.<p><b>and to perform His task, His disturbing task.</b><br>The "disturbing task" indicates a work of judgment that is unsettling or surprising. This can be seen as a warning to Israel of impending judgment due to their disobedience and rebellion. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the reality of divine justice. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the judgment for sin, a task that was both disturbing and redemptive.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is depicted as rising up to perform a unique and unexpected work.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_perazim.htm">Mount Perazim</a></b><br>A location where God previously intervened on behalf of Israel, associated with a victory over the Philistines during King David's reign (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_gibeon.htm">Valley of Gibeon</a></b><br>Another site of divine intervention, where God aided Israel in battle by causing the sun to stand still during Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-14</a>).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message, warning of God's impending judgment and unexpected actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel/judah.htm">Israel/Judah</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is sovereign and can intervene in history in unexpected ways.
