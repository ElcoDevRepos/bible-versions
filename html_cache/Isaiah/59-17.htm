In ancient warfare, a breastplate was essential for safeguarding vital organs, symbolizing how righteousness protects the believer's heart and soul. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where Paul instructs believers to wear the "breastplate of righteousness" as part of the armor of God. The righteousness here is not self-derived but is imputed by God, reflecting His character and justice. This phrase also connects to the Messianic role of Christ, who embodies perfect righteousness and offers it to believers.<p><b>and the helmet of salvation on His head</b><br>The helmet represents salvation, offering protection for the mind against doubt and despair. In the context of Isaiah, this salvation is both immediate and eschatological, pointing to deliverance from sin and ultimate redemption. The Apostle Paul also uses this imagery in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>, emphasizing the assurance and hope that salvation provides. This helmet signifies the security and confidence believers have in God's saving power, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Savior.<p><b>He put on garments of vengeance</b><br>The garments of vengeance indicate God's role as a just judge who will repay evil and uphold justice. This reflects the divine retribution against sin and the vindication of His people. In the cultural context of Isaiah's time, vengeance was often associated with divine intervention to restore order and righteousness. This phrase foreshadows the final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom, where Christ will execute justice (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><b>and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal</b><br>The cloak of zeal signifies God's passionate commitment to His purposes and His people. Zeal here is an intense, fervent devotion to righteousness and justice. This imagery suggests that God's actions are driven by His love and commitment to His covenant. In the New Testament, Jesus' zeal for God's house is evident in <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>.

His first piece of armor is righteousness, fitting for the Judge of all the earth (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The breastplate protects the heart; God&#8217;s moral purity is flawless protection against every accusation (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p>&#8226; When Paul later urges believers to &#8220;stand firm&#8230;with the breastplate of righteousness in place&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>), he echoes this scene, showing that our own righteousness is borrowed from God&#8217;s perfect character (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the LORD wears righteousness, His judgments are always fair (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the helmet of salvation on His head</b><p>&#8226; Salvation originates with God, not us.

The Isaiah anthropomorphism is far less gross than the Homeric. The gods in Homer put on actual armour, and take sword and shield. Jehovah arms himself for the battle in a way that is manifestly metaphoric. He puts on a "Divine panoply" - righteousness as his breastplate, salvation as his helmet, vengeance for garments, and zeal, or jealousy, for a cloak. He takes no offensive weapons - "the out-breathing of his Spirit (ver. 19) is enough" (Kay). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/59-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He put on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;ba&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
