His role was to convey God's messages, often involving warnings and guidance. Hezekiah was a king known for his faithfulness to God, but he also made mistakes, as seen in this chapter. This encounter follows Hezekiah's recovery from illness and his display of wealth to Babylonian envoys, which Isaiah will address.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?&#8221;</b><br>Isaiah's questions are probing, indicating his awareness of the potential political and spiritual implications of Hezekiah's actions. The visit of the Babylonian envoys was significant, as Babylon was rising in power. Isaiah's inquiry suggests concern over Hezekiah's openness to foreign influence and the possible consequences for Judah.<p><b>&#8220;They came to me from a distant land,&#8221; Hezekiah replied,</b><br>Hezekiah's response highlights the geographical distance of Babylon, emphasizing its foreign nature. This distance also symbolizes the potential threat and allure of foreign alliances. In the ancient Near East, such alliances were common but often led to spiritual compromise, as foreign nations worshiped other gods.<p><b>&#8220;from Babylon.&#8221;</b><br>Babylon, at this time, was not yet the dominant empire it would become, but it was gaining influence. This mention foreshadows Babylon's future role in Judah's history, including the eventual Babylonian exile. The interaction with Babylon here is a precursor to the significant impact Babylon will have on the Jewish people, as prophesied by Isaiah and other prophets. This moment also serves as a type of Christ, as it points to the need for a faithful king who would not rely on foreign powers but on God alone, a role ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah served as a messenger of God, delivering His words to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

Isaiah&#8217;s visit exposes Hezekiah&#8217;s prideful welcome of Babylonian envoys, his careless disclosure of Judah&#8217;s wealth, and his shallow acknowledgment of potential danger. God employs the prophet&#8217;s questions to draw out truth, reminding every believer that hidden motives matter and worldly alliances never substitute for wholehearted dependence on Him. The verse stands as a sober hinge: the same Babylon that seems distant in flattery will soon arrive in judgment, confirming the faithfulness and foresight of God&#8217;s Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Then came Isaiah . . .</span>--The words that follow, like those in <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;">Isaiah 7:3</a>, are spoken with the authority at once of age and of a Divine mission, perhaps also of a master speaking to one who had been his pupil. No sooner does the arrival of the embassy from Babylon reach his ear than he goes straight to the king to ask him what it all meant. The king's answer seems to plead that they came "from a far country" as an excuse. Could he refuse to admit those who had taken so long a journey in his honour? Could intercourse with a land so distant bring any moral or political danger? It was not like the alliance with Egypt, to which Isaiah was so strenuously opposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came Isaiah the prophet</span>. Isaiah comes, unsent for, to rebuke the king (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11-14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22-24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2-5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2, 3</a>, etc.). This bold attitude was one which prophets were entitled to take by virtue of their office, which called upon them to bear testimony, even before kings, and to have no respect of persons. A similar fearlessness is apparent in <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-17</a>, where the king with whom Isaiah has to deal was the wicked Ahaz. <span class="cmt_word">What said these men?</span> "These men" is contemptuous. The demand to know what they said is almost without parallel. Diplomacy, if it is to be successful, must be secret; and Isaiah can scarcely have been surprised that his searching question received no answer. But he was zealous of God's honour, and anxious that Hezekiah should rely on no "arm of flesh," whether it were Egypt or Babylon. Such dependence would straiten God's arm, and prevent him from giving the aid that he was otherwise prepared to give. The desire of the prophet is to warn the king of the danger which he runs by coquetting with human helpers. <span class="cmt_word">From whence came they?</span> Isaiah does not ask this question for the sake of information, Doubtless all Jerusalem was agog to see the strange envoys "from a far country," who had now for the first time penetrated to the city of David. All knew whence they had come, and suspected why. Isaiah asks, to force the king to a confession, on which he may base a prophecy and a warning. <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country.</span> Embassies from distant lands to their courts are made a con-slant subject of boasting by the Assyrian monarchs (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 28, 68, 95; vol. 7. pp. 49, 51, etc.).
