The repetition of "I" underscores the certainty and importance of the message. In the context of Isaiah, God is asserting His role as the ultimate source of prophecy and truth. This echoes earlier declarations of God's uniqueness and power, such as in <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-6</a>, where God declares there is no other besides Him. It also reflects the divine authority seen in the creation narrative in Genesis, where God speaks and creation comes into being.<p><b>yes, I have called him.</b><br>The "him" in this context refers to Cyrus, the Persian king, whom God has chosen to fulfill His purposes. This calling is significant as it demonstrates God's control over history and nations. The calling of Cyrus is a fulfillment of earlier prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28 and 45</a>:1, where God names Cyrus as His anointed, chosen to deliver Israel from Babylonian captivity. This calling also prefigures the calling of Christ, who is the ultimate deliverer and fulfiller of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>I have brought him,</b><br>This indicates God's active role in guiding and empowering Cyrus to accomplish His will. Historically, Cyrus's rise to power and his subsequent decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) is seen as a direct result of God's intervention. This phrase highlights the theme of divine providence, where God orchestrates events and leaders to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used other foreign rulers like Nebuchadnezzar for His plans.<p><b>and he will succeed in his mission.</b><br>The success of Cyrus is assured by God's declaration. This success is not due to Cyrus's own abilities but because God has ordained it. The mission refers to the liberation of the Israelites and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, which Cyrus facilitates. This assurance of success parallels the certainty of Christ's mission, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant will accomplish God's will. It also reflects the biblical principle that when God purposes something, it will come to pass, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word does not return void.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority in calling and commissioning His chosen servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus.htm">Cyrus (implied)</a></b><br>Although not named in this specific verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/48.htm">Isaiah 48</a> suggests that God is referring to Cyrus, the Persian king, whom He has called to fulfill His purposes for Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom God is speaking through the prophet Isaiah, reminding them of His control over their destiny and His plans for their deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place from which Israel will be delivered, as God uses Cyrus to conquer Babylon and allow the Israelites to return to their homeland.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The messenger through whom God communicates His plans and purposes to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses individuals, even those outside of Israel, to accomplish His divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_calling_and_mission.htm">Divine Calling and Mission</a></b><br>Just as God called Cyrus for a specific mission, He calls each of us to fulfill His purposes in our lives.

The verse therefore grounds every hope of the exiles in the unbreakable reliability of divine speech.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yes, I have called him</b><p>The &#8220;him&#8221; is first a literal reference to Cyrus, the Persian ruler God appoints to release Israel from Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a> &#8211; 5).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;call&#8221; is personal and purposeful, echoing His earlier summons of Abraham (<a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord directs even Gentile kings, Judah can trust that no human barrier blocks His redemptive plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Beyond Cyrus, the verse foreshadows the ultimate Servant, Christ, whom the Father also calls (<a href="/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18</a>; <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have brought him</b><p>The Lord not only selects but also escorts His chosen instrument onto the stage of history.<p>&#8226; He &#8220;stirs up&#8221; Cyrus, granting victories from the east (<a href="/isaiah/41-3.htm">Isaiah 41:3</a> &#8211; 4; 45:13).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s guidance is hands-on: &#8220;&#8216;I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern mirrors Israel&#8217;s own story&#8212;delivered from Egypt and &#8220;brought&#8221; into the land (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6-8</a>)&#8212;reinforcing that salvation is always God-initiated and God-sustained.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he will succeed in his mission</b><p>Success is guaranteed because it rests on divine backing, not human prowess.<p>&#8226; The same Lord who &#8220;declares the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>) ensures that Cyrus conquers Babylon and decrees the Jews&#8217; return (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22-23</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word &#8220;will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, Christ&#8217;s completed work perfectly embodies this promise of triumphant mission (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/48-15.htm">Isaiah 48:15</a> assures Judah&#8212;and every reader&#8212;that the Lord who speaks is the Lord who calls, guides, and guarantees success. His faithful word raised up Cyrus to liberate the exiles and prefigured the greater deliverance achieved by Jesus.

Cyrus is represented as raised up by God, "called" by him, and commissioned by him "to do all his pleasure." God has brought him on his way, and made that way prosperous. According to the account of Herodotus, Cyrus received no check of any kind until the last expedition, in which he lost his life. His "prosperity" was beyond that of almost any other commander. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/48-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have spoken;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(dib&#183;bar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have called him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular &#124;
