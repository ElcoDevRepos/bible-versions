It was the site where David received consecrated bread and Goliath's sword from Ahimelech. The Assyrian army, led by Sennacherib, is depicted as halting at Nob, indicating their proximity to Jerusalem. This pause signifies a moment of threat and impending danger to the city, emphasizing the urgency and seriousness of the Assyrian invasion. The historical context suggests a time of great fear for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as the enemy was at their doorstep.<p><b>shaking a fist at the mount of Daughter Zion</b><br>The phrase "shaking a fist" symbolizes defiance and aggression. The Assyrians, confident in their military might, display contempt and challenge towards Jerusalem, often referred to as "Daughter Zion." This term is a poetic personification of the city, highlighting its vulnerability and cherished status in God's eyes. The imagery of shaking a fist underscores the arrogance of the Assyrians and their underestimation of God's protection over Zion. This act of defiance is a precursor to divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>, where God ultimately delivers Jerusalem from Assyrian hands.<p><b>at the hill of Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, situated on a hill, was a strategically significant city, both politically and spiritually. It was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, making it a focal point of God's covenant with Israel. The reference to the "hill of Jerusalem" emphasizes its elevated position, both geographically and in terms of its importance to the Israelites. Historically, Jerusalem had withstood various sieges, and its fortifications were a source of pride and security for its inhabitants. The Assyrian threat to this sacred city highlights the tension between human power and divine sovereignty, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance as a testament to His faithfulness and protection over His chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>A small town near Jerusalem, significant in biblical history as a place where priests lived and where King Saul ordered the massacre of the priests (1 Samuel 22).
