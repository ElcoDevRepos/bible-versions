God's wisdom is perfect and surpasses human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The disaster mentioned refers to the consequences of relying on human strength rather than divine guidance. Historically, this can be seen in the Assyrian invasion, which was a direct result of Israel's disobedience and misplaced trust. God's wisdom is also evident in His ability to use nations as instruments of judgment, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>He does not call back His words.</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and reliability of God's pronouncements. Unlike humans, who may retract their words, God's declarations are irrevocable and will come to pass (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). This is a reminder of the prophetic nature of Isaiah's message, where God's words through the prophets are fulfilled with precision. The unchanging nature of God's word is a theme throughout Scripture, highlighting His faithfulness and the assurance that His promises and warnings will be fulfilled.<p><b>He will rise up against the house of the wicked</b><br>Here, "the house of the wicked" refers to those who oppose God's will, including both the Israelites who have turned away from Him and their foreign allies. This phrase indicates God's active role in opposing and judging wickedness. The imagery of God rising up suggests a powerful intervention, reminiscent of His actions against the enemies of Israel in the past, such as the Egyptians during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). It serves as a warning that God's justice will prevail against those who persist in evil.<p><b>and against the allies of evildoers.</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility of forming alliances with those who do not honor God. In the context of Isaiah, it refers to the political alliances Israel sought with Egypt, which were contrary to God's command to trust in Him alone (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>). The allies of evildoers are not exempt from God's judgment, as seen in the eventual downfall of Egypt and other nations that opposed God's people. This serves as a broader principle that aligning with ungodly forces leads to shared consequences, reinforcing the call to trust in God's sovereignty and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, described as wise and just, who brings disaster upon the wicked and their allies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_wicked.htm">The House of the Wicked</a></b><br>Represents those who oppose God's will and live in rebellion against His commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/allies_of_evildoers.htm">Allies of Evildoers</a></b><br>Those who support or align themselves with the wicked, sharing in their opposition to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message, serving as God's mouthpiece to the people of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Isaiah's prophecies were primarily directed, often warned against relying on foreign alliances instead of trusting in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_nature.htm">God's Unchanging Nature</a></b><br>God's wisdom and justice are constant.
