Jerusalem is often called the "holy city" because it is the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. This identification implies a sense of pride and belonging to a place chosen by God. However, the context of Isaiah suggests a critique of superficial religiosity, where the people claim association with holiness without true devotion. This echoes Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where outward appearances do not match inward realities.<p><b>and lean on the God of Israel;</b><br>To "lean on" signifies reliance or trust. The Israelites profess to depend on the God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and established them in the Promised Land. This trust is foundational to their identity as God's chosen people. However, Isaiah often challenges the sincerity of this reliance, as the people frequently turn to idols and foreign alliances instead of trusting God fully. This theme of misplaced trust is also seen in <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God accuses Israel of forsaking Him, the "spring of living water," for broken cisterns.<p><b>the LORD of Hosts is His name.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. It underscores His authority and ability to accomplish His purposes. This name reassures the faithful of God's ultimate control and protection. In the context of Isaiah, it serves as a reminder of God's might in contrast to the impotence of idols. The title is also a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Jesus is depicted as the conquering King leading the armies of heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_city.htm">The Holy City (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, the central place of worship and the symbolic heart of the Jewish faith.
