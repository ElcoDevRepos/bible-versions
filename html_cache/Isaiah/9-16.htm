In the context of Isaiah, the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, were leading the people astray from God's commandments. Historically, this period was marked by political alliances with pagan nations and idolatry, which were contrary to God's instructions. The leaders' failure to adhere to God's law resulted in spiritual and moral decay. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>, where God condemns the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of His pasture. The New Testament also warns against false teachers in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, emphasizing the importance of sound doctrine and faithful leadership.<p><b>mislead them</b><br>The act of misleading implies intentional or negligent guidance away from truth. In the biblical context, this often involved leading people into idolatry or false worship, as seen in the reigns of kings like Ahab, who promoted the worship of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). The Hebrew word used here can also suggest causing someone to err or wander, which is significant in a spiritual sense. Jesus Christ, in contrast, is depicted as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, who leads His flock in truth and righteousness, highlighting the stark difference between false leaders and the true Messiah.<p><b>and those they mislead are swallowed up</b><br>This phrase indicates the dire consequences for those who follow false guidance. The imagery of being "swallowed up" suggests destruction and judgment, reminiscent of the earth swallowing Korah and his followers in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a> as a result of their rebellion against God's appointed leadership. In Isaiah's time, the people faced the threat of Assyrian invasion and exile as a direct consequence of their leaders' misguidance. This serves as a warning of the spiritual peril that comes from following false teachings, a theme reiterated in the New Testament, where Jesus warns of the blind leading the blind in <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>, resulting in both falling into a pit. The ultimate fulfillment of righteous leadership is found in Christ, who offers salvation and truth to those who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

When leaders fear the LORD, people flourish (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). When they rebel, a whole nation deteriorates (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes Isaiah&#8217;s concern: &#8220;Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-39.htm">Luke 6:39</a>).

Isaiah has just recorded, &#8220;The people do not return to Him who strikes them&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Our Lord confronts the same issue: &#8220;They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Today, any teaching that contradicts Scripture&#8212;however winsome&#8212;still qualifies as misleading (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those they mislead</b><p>&#8226; The tragedy widens: people follow error because it often sounds soothing (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God never excuses personal responsibility, yet He recognizes how persuasive corrupt leadership can be (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah earlier warned, &#8220;Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls conspiracy&#8230; the LORD of Hosts is the One you are to regard as holy&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12-13</a>).
