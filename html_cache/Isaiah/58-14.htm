In the context of <a href="/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>, it follows a call to true fasting and justice, suggesting that spiritual fulfillment comes from aligning one's actions with God's will. Delighting in the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>, which encourages believers to find their joy in God rather than worldly pursuits. This delight is not merely emotional but involves a deep-seated contentment and trust in God's character and promises.<p><b>and I will make you ride on the heights of the land</b><br>This imagery conveys victory, security, and divine favor. Riding on the heights suggests a position of advantage and blessing, reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, where God promises Israel prosperity and protection. Historically, this can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's restoration and exaltation among the nations. It also reflects the covenant blessings promised to those who are faithful to God, indicating a life elevated above the struggles and oppressions of the world.<p><b>and feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob.&#8221;</b><br>The heritage of Jacob refers to the covenant promises given to the patriarchs, including land, descendants, and a special relationship with God. This promise of sustenance and inheritance is both physical and spiritual, pointing to the blessings of the Promised Land and the spiritual legacy of faith. It connects to <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>, where God reaffirms His covenant with Jacob. This phrase assures the faithful of their place in God's ongoing plan and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This declaration underscores the certainty and authority of God's promises. When the Lord speaks, His words are unchangeable and trustworthy, as seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the reliability of His word, encouraging believers to trust in His declarations and live in obedience to His commands. This assurance is foundational to the faith, reinforcing the idea that God's promises are as steadfast as His character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises blessings to His people when they follow His ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of Israel, representing the heritage and promises given to the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heights_of_the_land.htm">The Heights of the Land</a></b><br>Symbolic of victory, prosperity, and divine favor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_isaiah.htm">The Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The author of the book, delivering God's message to the people of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the prophecy is directed, called to repentance and true worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/delighting_in_the_lord.htm">Delighting in the LORD</a></b><br>True delight in God comes from a heart aligned with His will and purposes.

Israel, having laid aside its formalism, and turned to God sincerely. keeping fast and sabbath as God would have them kept, not in the letter, but in the spirit, would enter upon the promised heritage, and occupy the position originally assigned to it. Israel's rejection of the gospel made the mixed Christian Church the inheritress of the old promises. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/58-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will delight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#7791;&#183;&#8216;an&#183;na&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6026.htm">Strong's 6026: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be soft, pliable, effeminate, luxurious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yourself in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I will make you ride</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hir&#183;ka&#7687;&#183;t&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
