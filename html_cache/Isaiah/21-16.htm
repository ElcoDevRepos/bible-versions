The authority of the message is underscored by the use of "the Lord," which in the Hebrew text is "Yahweh," the covenant name of God. This introduction is typical of prophetic literature, where the prophet serves as a mouthpiece for God's words.<p><b>Within one year,</b><br>The specific time frame of "one year" suggests urgency and certainty. In the context of biblical prophecy, time frames are often used to convey the immediacy of God's actions. This particular prophecy is not open-ended but has a clear deadline, emphasizing the reliability and precision of God's word.<p><b>as a hired worker would count it,</b><br>This phrase implies a precise and exact measurement of time, akin to how a hired worker would meticulously track the days of their contract. It suggests that the fulfillment of this prophecy is as certain and predictable as the end of a laborer's term of service. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the certainty of His promises.<p><b>all the glory of Kedar will be gone.</b><br>Kedar was a nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, known for their wealth and military prowess, as well as their trade in livestock and goods. The "glory" of Kedar likely refers to their economic prosperity and military strength. Historically, Kedar was located in the Arabian Desert, and its downfall would have significant implications for the region's power dynamics. This prophecy highlights the transient nature of human glory and power, contrasting it with the eternal nature of God's kingdom. The mention of Kedar also connects to other biblical passages that speak of the judgment of nations, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28-33</a>, where Kedar is similarly prophesied against.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who received the message from the Lord.

Its &#8220;glory&#8221; included military might, wealth, and reputation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28-29</a> echoes the same downfall: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against you&#8230; their tents and flocks will be taken.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophecy announces that every source of Kedar&#8217;s pride will collapse&#8212;livestock seized, warriors defeated, fame erased (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This swift judgment models God&#8217;s impartial justice: even distant desert tribes are accountable to Him (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a> delivers a precise, divine forecast: &#8220;Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone&#8221;. God Himself speaks, setting a literal twelve-month deadline. The hired-worker analogy underscores exactness; the downfall of Kedar proves that no nation&#8217;s wealth or military strength can shield it from the Lord&#8217;s timetable.

"Kedar" is a name of greater note than either Dedan or Tome. It seems to be used here as inclusive of Dedan, perhaps as a designation of the northern Arabians generally. The people of Kedar, like those of Dedan, carried on trade with Tyro (<a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>). They dwelt partly in tents (<a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>), partly in villages (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>), and were rich in flocks and herds and in camels. Though not mentioned in the inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib, or Esarhaddon, the contemporaries of Isaiah, they hold a prominent place in those of Esarhaddon's son and successor, Asshurbanipal, with whom they carried on a war of some considerable duration in conjunction with the Nabathaeans (G.
