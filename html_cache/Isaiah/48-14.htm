It reflects the prophetic tradition where the prophet calls the assembly to hear God's word. This echoes the frequent biblical theme of God summoning His people to listen to His commands and warnings, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel."<p><b>Which of the idols has foretold these things?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the power and knowledge of idols compared to the sovereignty of God. In the context of Isaiah, God often contrasts His omniscience and omnipotence with the impotence of idols (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). This highlights the futility of idol worship and underscores God's unique ability to predict and control future events, a theme also found in <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a>.<p><b>The LORD&#8217;s chosen ally will carry out His desire against Babylon:</b><br>This refers to God's use of a chosen instrument to fulfill His purposes, specifically against Babylon. Historically, this is understood to refer to Cyrus the Great, the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539 BC. Cyrus is mentioned explicitly in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a> as God's anointed, chosen to deliver Israel. This demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use even foreign rulers to accomplish His divine plans.<p><b>and His arm will be against the Chaldeans:</b><br>The Chaldeans were a dominant group within Babylon, often synonymous with the Babylonian Empire. God's "arm" symbolizes His power and might in executing judgment. This phrase indicates divine retribution against Babylon for its idolatry and oppression of Israel. The fall of Babylon is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing the ultimate triumph of God's justice, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a> and <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who declares His plans and purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and idolatry, often representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans</a></b><br>A people associated with Babylon, known for their wisdom and astrology, often seen as adversaries to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant (Implied)</a></b><br>Though not named here, the "him" whom the LORD loves is often interpreted as Cyrus, the Persian king, or prophetically as the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience (Israel)</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are called to listen and understand God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses nations and leaders to accomplish His purposes.

God "loves" all who "in an honest and good heart" seek according to their lights to do his will and serve him faithfully.
