The term "woe" is a prophetic declaration of impending judgment or disaster. In this context, it signifies God's disapproval and the impending doom that will befall Assyria despite its current power. Historically, Assyria was used by God as an instrument to discipline Israel, but their pride and cruelty led to their own downfall. This phrase sets the stage for understanding Assyria's role in God's divine plan and the eventual consequences of their actions.<p><b>the rod of My anger</b><br>The "rod" symbolizes an instrument of discipline or correction. In biblical times, a rod was used by shepherds to guide and correct their sheep, and here it represents God's use of Assyria to execute judgment on Israel for their disobedience. This imagery underscores the sovereignty of God, who can use even pagan nations to fulfill His purposes. It also reflects the theme of divine retribution, where God uses nations as tools to accomplish His will, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>, where Babylon is called God's "war club."<p><b>the staff in their hands is My wrath</b><br>The "staff" is another symbol of authority and power, often associated with leadership and control. In this context, it represents the power given to Assyria to carry out God's wrath against Israel. The phrase emphasizes that Assyria's military success is not due to their own strength but is permitted by God as an expression of His righteous anger. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is in control of history and uses nations to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>, where God raises up the Chaldeans for a similar purpose. The use of "My wrath" indicates that while Assyria acts, it is ultimately God's judgment being executed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire in the ancient Near East, known for its military might and conquests.

God is not indifferent to Assyria&#8217;s violence; He announces impending consequence.<p>- Assyria, the super-power of Isaiah&#8217;s day, thought itself invincible, yet God addresses it directly&#8212;personal, unmistakable. Compare: &#8220;Woe to him who builds his house by injustice&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>) and &#8220;Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>). Each &#8220;woe&#8221; in Scripture warns that rebellion against God invites His decisive action.<p>- Assyria&#8217;s military campaigns ravaged nations (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>), but its pride set it on a collision course with the Almighty (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>). God&#8217;s heart grieves over sin even while He judges it (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the rod of My anger</b><p>- A &#8220;rod&#8221; in biblical imagery is a tool of discipline (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). Here the Lord openly calls Assyria &#8220;the rod of My anger&#8221; to show He is wielding this empire as a corrective instrument.<p>&#8226; Israel and Judah had ignored repeated prophetic calls to repent (<a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Rather than abandon His people, God uses Assyria&#8217;s armies to bring them to their knees, much as a father disciplines a son he loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>- This does not excuse Assyria&#8217;s cruelty; it highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty. As He later tells another empire, &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar&#8230; My servant&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>), so too Assyria operates under divine oversight even when unaware of it (<a href="/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the staff in their hands is My wrath</b><p>- A &#8220;staff&#8221; steadies a traveler or strikes an enemy. God clarifies that the blows Assyria delivers are an outworking of His righteous wrath against covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 49</a>-52).<p>- Notice the balance:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s wrath is real&#8212;He cannot overlook sin (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the staff remains &#8220;in their hands,&#8221; emphasizing human responsibility.

Assyria had been named in connection with the Syro-Ephraim alliance against Judah (<a href="/context/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>); but this is the first prophetic utterance of which it is the direct subject. Anticipating the phraseology of <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>, we might call it the "burden of Assyria." In the judgment of the best Assyrian scholars, some years had passed since the date of the alliance and invasion. Tiglath ? pileser had taken Damascus and reduced Samaria to submission. Pekah and Ahaz had met at Damascus to do homage to their common suzerain. In B.C. 727 Salmaneser succeeded to the throne of Assyria, and began the conquest of Samaria and the deportation of the Ten Tribes in B.C. 722 (<a href="/context/2_kings/17-3.htm" title="Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.">2Kings 17:3-6</a>). On his death, in B.C. 721, the throne was seized by Sargon, who had been his Tartan, or commander-in-chief (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>). The achievements of this king are recorded at length in an inscription discovered by M. Botta at Khorsabad (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 28. Lenormant's <span class= "ital">Manual, </span>1 p. 392). In it he says:--"I besieged, took, and occupied the city of Samaria, and carried into captivity 27,280 of its inhabitants. I changed the form of government of the country, and placed over it lieutenants of my own." In another inscription discovered at Kouyunyik, but unfortunately incomplete, Sargon speaks of himself as "the conqueror of the far-off land of Judah" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Inscriptions, </span>33:8). It was probably to this king, exulting in his triumphs and threatening an attack on Judah, and not (as was commonly thought prior to the discovery of the inscription) to his son Sennacherib, who succeeded him B.C. 704, that the prophet now addressed himself. The first words proclaim that the great king was but an instrument working out the Divine intent, the "rod," and the "staff," the "axe" and the "saw" (<a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm" title="Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.">Isaiah 10:15</a>). So in <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>, the earlier king of Assyria is as "the razor that is hired." So Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm" title="You are my battle ax and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is the "battle-axe" or "hammer" of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm" title="Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps.">Isaiah 37:26</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-19.</span> - ASSYRIA, AFTER BEING GOD'S INSTRUMENT TO PUNISH ISRAEL, SHALL HERSELF BE PUNISHED IN HER TURN. The wicked are a sword in the hand of God (<a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>), wherewith he executes his judgments; but this fact is hid from them, and they imagine that they are successful through their own strength and might. So it was with Assyria (vers. 5-14), which its long career of victory had made proud and arrogant above measure. God now, by the mouth of Isaiah, makes known his intention of bringing down the pride of Assyria, and laying her glory in the dust, by a sudden and great destruction (vers. 15:19), after she has served his purposes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Assyrian</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Ho! Asshur</span>. "Asshur" is the nation personified, and is here addressed as an individual. The transition from vers. 1-4 is abrupt, and may be taken to indicate an accidental juxtaposition of two entirely distinct prophecies. Or Assyria may be supposed to have been in the prophet's thought, though not in his words, when he spoke of "prisoners" and "slain" in the first clause of ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of mine anger</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>, where it is said of Babylon, "Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy the kingdoms").
