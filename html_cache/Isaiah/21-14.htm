In the arid regions of the Middle East, water is a precious resource, symbolizing life and sustenance. The call to bring water reflects the biblical principle of hospitality and compassion, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, where Jesus commends those who give drink to the thirsty. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers Himself as the "living water" (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>), providing spiritual sustenance to all who believe.<p><b>O dwellers of Tema</b><br>Tema was an oasis town in the Arabian Desert, known for its strategic location on trade routes. The inhabitants of Tema were likely familiar with travelers and the needs of those passing through. This reference underscores the importance of hospitality in ancient cultures, where providing for travelers was a duty and a sign of righteousness. The mention of Tema connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's provision and care for His people, as seen in the story of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), where unexpected sources provide aid.<p><b>meet the refugees with food</b><br>The term "refugees" suggests individuals fleeing from danger or seeking safety, possibly due to conflict or disaster. In the historical context of Isaiah, this could refer to those escaping the Assyrian invasions. Providing food to refugees aligns with the biblical mandate to care for the stranger and the needy, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>. This act of mercy reflects God's heart for justice and compassion, and it foreshadows the ultimate provision found in Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering eternal sustenance to all who come to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dwellers_of_tema.htm">Dwellers of Tema</a></b><br>Tema was an oasis town in the Arabian Desert, known for its trade routes and hospitality.

When people stagger through the desert heat, water is life itself (<a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4-9</a>). Similar calls to refresh the weary appear throughout Scripture&#8212;think of Jesus&#8217; promise in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a> or His commendation of those who give &#8220;even a cup of cold water&#8221; in <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>.
