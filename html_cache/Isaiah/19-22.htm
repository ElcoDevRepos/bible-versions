In biblical history, Egypt is often seen as a symbol of worldly power and opposition to God's people, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The "plague" recalls the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, which were acts of judgment against Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt. This suggests a pattern where God uses plagues as a means to demonstrate His sovereignty and to call nations to repentance.<p><b>He will strike them but heal them.</b><br>This reflects God's dual nature of justice and mercy. While God disciplines, His ultimate purpose is restoration. The striking followed by healing suggests a redemptive process, where judgment leads to repentance and restoration. This is consistent with God's character throughout Scripture, where He desires not the death of the wicked but that they turn from their ways and live (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>).<p><b>They will turn to the LORD,</b><br>This phrase indicates repentance and conversion. The turning to the LORD signifies a change of heart and allegiance. In the context of Isaiah, this is a prophetic vision of Egypt acknowledging the God of Israel, which is significant given Egypt's historical role as an oppressor. This turning is a fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham's seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and He will hear their prayers and heal them.</b><br>This highlights God's responsiveness to genuine repentance. The assurance that God will hear prayers is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His readiness to forgive and restore those who seek Him (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The healing mentioned here is both spiritual and possibly physical, symbolizing a complete restoration of relationship with God. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who through His sacrifice, offers healing and reconciliation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign over all nations, including Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine judgment or calamity sent by God as a means of correction or punishment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/healing.htm">Healing</a></b><br>The restoration and reconciliation that follows repentance and turning back to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/turning_to_the_lord.htm">Turning to the LORD</a></b><br>The act of repentance and seeking God, resulting in divine response and healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations, and His purposes will be accomplished, even through judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_as_a_means_to_repentance.htm">Judgment as a Means to Repentance</a></b><br>God's judgments are not merely punitive but are intended to lead people to repentance and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_healing.htm">The Promise of Healing</a></b><br>God's desire is to heal and restore those who turn to Him, demonstrating His mercy and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves turning away from sin and turning towards God, resulting in His response and healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_respond.htm">God's Faithfulness to Respond</a></b><br>When people genuinely seek God, He is faithful to respond to their pleas and bring healing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_19_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 19:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_22_God_s_healing_power.htm">How does Isaiah 19:22 illustrate God's power to heal and restore nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Egypt_s_plague_show_about_God.htm">What does "strike Egypt with a plague" reveal about God's judgment and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_19_22_inspire_healing.htm">How can Isaiah 19:22 encourage us to seek God's healing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Scriptures_on_healing_after_repentance.htm">What other scriptures show God's willingness to heal after repentance and turning to Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Isaiah_19_22_lessons_today.htm">How can we apply the lessons from Isaiah 19:22 in our community today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_22_God_s_bond_with_Egypt.htm">How does Isaiah 19:22 reflect God's relationship with Egypt in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_22_God_s_punishment_and_healing.htm">What does Isaiah 19:22 reveal about God's nature in terms of punishment and healing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_22_prophecy_historical_proof.htm">How is the prophecy in Isaiah 19:22 historically fulfilled or evidenced?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_isaiah_19_differ_from_ezekiel_29.htm">Why does Isaiah 19&#8217;s prophecy differ from other prophetic passages about Egypt (e.g., Ezekiel 29) if they both claim divine judgment?
