This inquiry is not just about time but about the extent of judgment. It echoes the cries of other prophets and psalmists who sought understanding of God's timing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>). It shows the prophet's empathy and his desire for restoration.<p><b>And He replied: &#8220;Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant,</b><br>This response indicates a complete and thorough judgment. The imagery of ruined cities is consistent with the consequences of disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian exile when Jerusalem and other cities were destroyed (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>). The desolation serves as a warning and a call to repentance.<p><b>until the houses are left unoccupied</b><br>The abandonment of houses signifies a total societal collapse. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a house was not just a dwelling but a symbol of family and legacy. The empty houses represent the loss of community and continuity. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the exile, where the Israelites were removed from their land and homes.<p><b>and the land is desolate and ravaged,</b><br>The desolation of the land is a direct consequence of the people's sin, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-35</a>. The land, once flowing with milk and honey, becomes barren, reflecting the spiritual barrenness of the people.

It shows Isaiah&#8217;s compassion&#8212;he is not indifferent to the people who will suffer.<p>&#8226; At the same time, he submits to God&#8217;s timetable, acknowledging the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God welcomes honest lament while still calling us to trust His perfect wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant&#8221;</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s answer points to a definite, measurable period: judgment will last until devastation is complete.<p>&#8226;

<a href="/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a> repeats the imagery, proving consistent testimony among the prophets.<p>&#8226; The land&#8217;s barrenness magnifies the miracle when God later makes it fruitful again (<a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>), assuring us that judgment is never His final word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a> answers the prophet&#8217;s anguished &#8220;How long?&#8221; with a sober timeline: the impending Babylonian judgment will run its full course until cities are leveled, homes stand empty, and the land itself lies in ruins. This literal devastation demonstrates God&#8217;s holiness and the serious cost of persistent sin, yet it also carries seeds of hope&#8212;He sets limits, preserves a remnant, and prepares the way for ultimate restoration. For every generation, the verse calls us to heed God&#8217;s warnings, trust His timing, and look beyond discipline to His redemptive purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Lord, how long?</span>--The prophet asks the question which is ever on the lips of those who are brought face to face with the problems of the world, with the great mystery of evil, sin permitted to work out fresh evil as its punishment, and yet remaining evil. How long shall all this last? So a later prophet, towards the close of the seventy years of exile, cried once again, "How long?" (<a href="/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>).

They suggest an answer to all analogous questions. Stroke after stroke must come, judgment after judgment, till the sin has been adequately punished; but the darkness of the prospect, terrible as it is, does not exclude the glimmer of an eternal hope for the far-off future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I, Lord, how long?</span> Either, "How long am I to continue this preaching?" or, "How long is this blindness and callousness of the people to continue?"
