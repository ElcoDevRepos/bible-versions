This interaction follows Isaiah's prophecy about the future Babylonian captivity of Judah. Hezekiah's response is significant as it reflects his character and priorities. Historically, Hezekiah was a king who sought to follow God, as seen in his earlier reforms and reliance on God during the Assyrian threat (2 Kings 18-19). However, this moment reveals a more complex aspect of his leadership and personal concerns.<p><b>&#8220;The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.&#8221;</b><br>Hezekiah's acceptance of Isaiah's prophecy as "good" is intriguing. It suggests a resignation to God's will, acknowledging the authority and truth of the prophetic word. This phrase can be compared to other biblical figures who accepted God's difficult pronouncements, such as Eli in <a href="/1_samuel/3-18.htm">1 Samuel 3:18</a>. It also reflects a common biblical theme of submission to God's sovereignty, even when the message is unfavorable.<p><b>For he thought,</b><br>This internal reflection provides insight into Hezekiah's mindset. It reveals a personal reasoning that contrasts with his outward acceptance. The Bible often records the thoughts of individuals to provide a deeper understanding of their motivations and spiritual state, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> and <a href="/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>.<p><b>&#8220;At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.&#8221;</b><br>Hezekiah's concern for peace and security during his own reign highlights a human tendency to prioritize immediate comfort over long-term consequences. This reflects a short-sightedness that can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as Esau selling his birthright for immediate gratification (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>). Theologically, it raises questions about stewardship and responsibility for future generations. The peace Hezekiah refers to is likely the absence of war and political stability, which were significant concerns for a king in the ancient Near East. This phrase also contrasts with the messianic hope of ultimate peace and security found in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, pointing to a future fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God but also for his human weaknesses.

Hezekiah concedes that whatever God decrees is intrinsically just (<a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors his earlier attitude when God extended his life&#8212;he recognized that blessing came from God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/isaiah/38-17.htm">Isaiah 38:17</a>). Now he recognizes that discipline also comes from that same just hand (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Acceptance without complaint differentiates Hezekiah from kings who resisted prophetic warnings (e.g., Jehoiakim cutting up Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll, <a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he thought</b><p>&#8226; Scripture pulls back the curtain on Hezekiah&#8217;s inner reasoning, something the parallel account in <a href="/2_kings/20-19.htm">2 Kings 20:19</a> also records.<p>&#8226; The verse exposes a mixed motivation: genuine submission yet tinged with personal relief.<p>&#8226; This candid look at a godly man&#8217;s heart reminds us that believers can embrace God&#8217;s sovereignty while still wrestling with self-interest (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Peace and security&#8221; (or &#8220;peace and truth,&#8221; <a href="/2_kings/20-19.htm">2 Kings 20:19</a>) reflects Hezekiah&#8217;s relief that calamity will not strike during his reign.<p>&#8226; His outlook contrasts with Moses, who interceded for future generations after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;13</a>), and with Paul, who bore continual concern for the churches (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>).<p>&#8226; God does not rebuke Hezekiah here, yet the narrative invites readers to sense the short-sightedness of valuing personal comfort over covenant faithfulness for coming generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underscores the lingering consequence of pride shown earlier when he displayed his storehouses to Babylonian envoys (<a href="/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a> records a king who rightly submits to God&#8217;s just verdict yet reveals a heart still learning to look beyond immediate personal blessing.

"Apres mot le deluge" is a saying attributed to a modern Frenchman. Hezekiah's egotism is less pronounced and less cynical. He thinks with gratitude of the "peace and steadfastness" which are to be "in his day;" he does not dwell in thought on the coming "deluge." The "word of the Lord" is "good" to him in more ways than one. It has assured him of coming male offspring - of sons to sit upon his throne, and save him from the curse of childlessness. And it has assured him of a rest for his nation - a respite, so that the Babylonian struggle shall not follow immediately upon the Assyrian; but there shall be a "breathing-space" (<a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>), a tranquil time, during which Israel may "dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places" (<a href="/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/39-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
