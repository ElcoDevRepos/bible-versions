This letter is delivered by messengers, indicating the formal and serious nature of the communication. Historically, Assyria was a dominant power, and their threats were not to be taken lightly. The letter likely contained demands for surrender and reminders of Assyria's previous conquests, emphasizing the gravity of the threat against Jerusalem.<p><b>read it</b><br>Hezekiah's act of reading the letter signifies his direct engagement with the crisis. This action reflects the importance of understanding the full scope of the threat before seeking divine intervention. In a broader biblical context, reading and understanding are often precursors to prayer and action, as seen in other scriptures where leaders seek God's guidance after assessing their situations.<p><b>and went up to the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Hezekiah's decision to go to the temple underscores his reliance on God rather than military might or political alliances. This act of going up to the temple is symbolic of seeking a higher power and divine intervention in times of trouble, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and spread it out before the LORD</b><br>By spreading the letter before the LORD, Hezekiah is symbolically laying his burdens and concerns at God's feet. This act of physically presenting the letter in the temple signifies a deep trust in God's ability to handle the situation. It is an act of faith and surrender, acknowledging that the battle belongs to the LORD. This gesture can be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament, teaches believers to cast their cares upon Him. The act of spreading out the letter is also reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals present their petitions directly to God, emphasizing the personal and relational aspect of prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Like Hezekiah, we first acknowledge what has arrived (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hezekiah read it</b><p>&#8226; Hezekiah gives full attention to the contents. By reading, he understands the depth of the enemy&#8217;s boast and the peril facing God&#8217;s people (<a href="/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that faith does not require ignorance; it invites informed dependence (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>: &#8220;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything&#8230; with thanksgiving, present your requests to God&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s deliberate reading demonstrates that prayer is not vague; it is specific, rooted in concrete circumstances (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; A practical takeaway: face problems squarely before bringing them to the Lord, so petitions are honest and precise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went up to the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Hezekiah&#8217;s immediate direction is upward&#8212;into God&#8217;s presence in the temple (<a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a>b). Geography reflects theology: help comes from above (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple signified God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-20.htm">2 Chronicles 6:20</a>). By choosing the house of the LORD, Hezekiah reminds himself of God&#8217;s promises to David and to Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of assembling war councils or sending diplomats, he prioritized worship over strategy (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This move models for believers the reflex of seeking God first when crises strike (<a href="/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He spread it out before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Laying the letter on the temple floor was a physical act of surrender: &#8220;Lord, see for Yourself what the enemy says.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It expressed confidence that the matter belonged in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture turned written threats into material for prayer, transforming fear into intercession (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By exposing the letter publicly before God, Hezekiah let divine honor, not personal pride, drive his plea (<a href="/isaiah/37-17.htm">Isaiah 37:17, 20</a>).<p>&#8226; The result&#8212;God&#8217;s dramatic deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>)&#8212;shows that casting burdens before Him invites His direct intervention (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a> pictures a four-step pattern for godly response to intimidation: receive the reality, read and understand it, rise to God&#8217;s presence, and release the burden before Him. Hezekiah&#8217;s humble, worship-centered action shifts the battle from human strength to divine might, affirming that the Lord alone defends His name and His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Hezekiah received the letter.</span>--The Hebrew noun is plural, as though the document consisted of more than one sheet.<p><span class= "bld">And spread it before the Lord.</span>--The act was one of mute appeal to the Supreme Arbiter. The <span class= "ital">corpus delicti </span>was, as it were, laid before the judge, and then the appellant offered up his prayer. Mr. Cheyne quotes a striking parallel from the "Annals of Assurbanipal" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 67), who, on receiving a defiant message from the King of Elam, went into the Temple of Ishtar, and, reminding the goddess of all he had done for her, besought her aid, and received an oracle from her as a vision of the night.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah received the letter</span>. Sennacherib sent his present message in a written form. The communications between kings were often carried on in this way (see <a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>). The Hebrews use the same word for "letter" and "book;" but, when a letter is intended, employ generally the plural number (compare the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">litterae</span>). And spread it before the Lord. Not that God might see it and read it, in a material sense, but still that he might take note of it, and, if he saw fit, punish it. Compare the exhibition of the Books of the Law, painted with idolatrous emblems, at Maspha, "over against" the temple, by Judas Maccabaeus and his companions (1 Macc. 3:46-48). The act in both cases implied the referring of the whole matter to God for his consideration. It was, as Delitzsch, says, a sort of "prayer without words." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">received</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
