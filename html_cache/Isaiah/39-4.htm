The palace represents the center of Hezekiah's power and wealth. Isaiah's inquiry highlights the potential consequences of Hezekiah's actions, as showing the treasures to a foreign power could lead to future threats. This moment is pivotal, as it foreshadows the Babylonian exile. The palace, in the context of ancient Near Eastern culture, was not just a residence but a symbol of the king's authority and the nation's prosperity.<p><b>&#8220;They have seen everything in my palace,&#8221; answered Hezekiah.</b><br>Hezekiah's response indicates a lack of discernment and possibly pride. By showing "everything," he reveals the full extent of Judah's wealth and resources, which could entice Babylonian interest. This act of transparency, while seemingly hospitable, is imprudent given the political climate. Historically, this reflects the vulnerability of smaller kingdoms like Judah when interacting with emerging empires such as Babylon. Theologically, it underscores the theme of misplaced trust in human alliances rather than reliance on God.<p><b>&#8220;There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.&#8221;</b><br>Hezekiah's admission that he withheld nothing from the Babylonians suggests a complete exposure of Judah's assets. The term "treasures" encompasses not only material wealth but also the sacred and cultural heritage of the nation. This act can be seen as a breach of stewardship, as the king's role was to protect and preserve the nation's resources. Biblically, this moment serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of wisdom in leadership. It also sets the stage for the prophetic warning of future Babylonian conquest and exile, as detailed in subsequent chapters of Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah served as a messenger of God, delivering His words to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

The prophet is not looking for a catalog of items; he is exposing the motives of Hezekiah&#8217;s heart.<p>&#8226; Accountability: Like Nathan confronting David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) and Peter challenging Ananias (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3&#8211;4</a>), Isaiah reminds us that a servant of God must give an honest account (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Discernment: Hezekiah had welcomed envoys from a rising superpower (<a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12&#8211;13</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s question presses him to consider whether that hospitality was wise (<a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Hidden motives revealed: God often tests His people to show what is in their hearts (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have seen everything in my palace</b><p>Hezekiah responds without hesitation&#8212;and without regret. His eagerness to display his wealth betrays a subtle pride.<p>&#8226; Pride of life: Scripture warns that &#8220;the boastful pride of life&#8230;is not from the Father&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Temporary security: Hezekiah may have hoped to impress Babylon and secure political favor, yet true security rests in the Lord alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Unchecked transparency: Showing &#8220;everything&#8221; exposed far more than material wealth; it showcased where his confidence lay (<a href="/luke/12-34.htm">Luke 12:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s final admission seals the issue. Nothing was withheld; therefore, nothing would be spared in the coming judgment (<a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Stewardship failure: God&#8217;s blessings are to be managed for His glory, not our self-promotion (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Consequences of pride: &#8220;When pride comes, then comes disgrace&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>). Isaiah soon declares that these very treasures will be carried off to Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Vulnerability: By laying everything open before foreign envoys, Hezekiah made Judah an easy target, illustrating how pride can blind us to danger (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Isaiah&#8217;s question, Hezekiah&#8217;s boastful answer, and the prophet&#8217;s ensuing warning form a sober lesson: pride in earthly treasure invites divine discipline. What God entrusts to His people is meant for His honor, not for flaunting before the world. True security is found not in palaces or possessions but in humble dependence on the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">What have they seen in thine house?</span>--The question was pressed home. Had the king contented himself with such hospitality as would have satisfied the demands of the code of Eastern ethics? or had he, as the prophet rightly suspected, done more than that, in his vain-glorious hope of figuring among the "great powers" of the East? On the minds of the ambassadors, we may well believe the impression left was like that made on Blucher as he passed through London: that it would be "a grand city to plunder."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have they seen?</span> Isaiah had, no doubt, heard of what Hezekiah had done (ver. 2); but he wished to have the confession of it from his own mouth before delivering his sentence.
