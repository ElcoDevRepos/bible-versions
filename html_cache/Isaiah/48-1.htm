The "house of Jacob" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, highlighting their identity as God's chosen people. This call to listen is reminiscent of prophetic traditions where God seeks to communicate His will to His people, urging them to heed His words.<p><b>you who are called by the name of Israel</b><br>The name "Israel" signifies the covenant relationship between God and His people. It recalls the transformation of Jacob's name to Israel after wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>), symbolizing a new identity and mission. This phrase underscores the privilege and responsibility of being God's people, called to live according to His statutes.<p><b>who have descended from the line of Judah</b><br>Judah is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, from which the Davidic line and ultimately Jesus Christ, the Messiah, would come. This reference to Judah highlights the royal lineage and the fulfillment of God's promises through this tribe. It also connects to prophecies concerning the Messiah's descent from David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>who swear by the name of the LORD</b><br>Swearing by the name of the LORD indicates making oaths or promises invoking God's name, which is a serious commitment. This practice is rooted in the understanding of God's holiness and the binding nature of His name. However, the context suggests a critique of insincere or hypocritical oaths, as the people are not living up to their commitments.<p><b>who invoke the God of Israel</b><br>Invoking God implies calling upon Him in prayer or worship. This phrase suggests a form of religious practice or ritual. However, the subsequent critique indicates that their invocation lacks genuine faith and obedience, pointing to a disconnect between their religious actions and their hearts.<p><b>but not in truth or righteousness</b><br>This phrase is a rebuke of the people's insincerity and moral failure. "Truth" and "righteousness" are central to God's character and His expectations for His people. The lack of these qualities indicates a superficial relationship with God, where outward religious practices are not matched by inner integrity and ethical living. This critique aligns with other prophetic calls for genuine repentance and justice (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_jacob.htm">House of Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, representing the nation of Israel as a whole.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The name given to Jacob after wrestling with God, symbolizing the chosen people of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/waters_of_judah.htm">Waters of Judah</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating the lineage and origin of the people from the tribe of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>A title that underscores God's special relationship with the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authentic_faith.htm">Authentic Faith</a></b><br>God desires truth and righteousness in our relationship with Him.

"Jacob" is the natural and secular designation; "Israel" is a spiritual or covenant name (Cheyne). Both terms being appropriate to the ten tribes no less than to the two, and the present address being intended especially for the Jewish captives, a further designation is appended - <span class="cmt_word">which are come forth out of the waters of Judah</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>, "Ye that are of the fountain of Israel," marginal rendering). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> <span class="cmt_word">swear by the Name of the Lord</span>. Swearing "by the Name of the Lord" is an evidence of true religion, to a certain extent (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>). It indicates that there has been, at any rate, no open apostasy. Still, it does not necessarily prove more than this; and, in the present case, it scarcely showed anything beyond mere outward formal conformity. The bulk of the captives "swore by the Name of Jehovah, and made mention of the God of Israel" (camp. <a href="/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a>), but did so not in truth, nor in righteousness; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without their state of mind or mode of action corresponding to their confession, so as to prove that it was sincerely and seriously meant" (Delitzsch). The condition of the majority of the exiles was that expressed in the words, "This people honoureth me with their lips, but in their hearts are far from me" (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/48-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">O house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jacob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you who are called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;niq&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
