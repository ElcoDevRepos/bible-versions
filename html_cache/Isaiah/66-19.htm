In biblical context, signs often serve as divine indicators of God's presence or action, such as the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a> or the miracles performed by Jesus. This sign could be understood as a miraculous event or a significant act of God that would be recognized by the people. It may also foreshadow the coming of Christ, who is often referred to as a sign (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>).<p><b>and I will send survivors from among them to the nations</b><br>The mention of "survivors" suggests a remnant, a common theme in the prophetic books where God preserves a faithful group through judgment or calamity (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). These survivors are tasked with a mission, indicating God's plan to use them as messengers to the nations. This reflects the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>to Tarshish, Put, and the archers of Lud</b><br>Tarshish is often associated with distant lands, possibly in the western Mediterranean, such as Spain. Put is traditionally linked to regions in North Africa, possibly Libya. Lud is associated with Lydia in Asia Minor, known for its skilled archers. These locations represent the far-reaching scope of God's message, emphasizing the universality of His glory and the spread of His fame beyond Israel.<p><b>to Tubal, Javan, and the islands far away</b><br>Tubal and Javan are regions associated with the descendants of Japheth (<a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>), often linked to areas in Asia Minor and Greece, respectively. The "islands far away" could refer to distant coastlands, symbolizing the ends of the earth. This highlights the prophetic vision of God's glory reaching all corners of the world, aligning with the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where people from every nation and language stand before God's throne.<p><b>who have not heard of My fame or seen My glory</b><br>This phrase underscores the ignorance of the nations regarding the true God. It reflects the biblical theme of revelation, where God's glory and fame are made known to those who have not yet encountered Him. This is reminiscent of Paul's mission to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>, where he quotes Isaiah to justify bringing the light of the gospel to those in darkness.<p><b>So they will proclaim My glory among the nations</b><br>The ultimate purpose of sending the survivors is to declare God's glory to the nations. This proclamation is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also prefigures the role of the Church in spreading the gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. This mission reflects the heart of God for all people to know Him and worship Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

The thought of a "remnant" to be saved is still characteristically dominant, and that "remnant" is to act as heralds of Jehovah to the far-distant nations who had not been sharers in any open antagonism to Israel, and who were, therefore, not involved in the great judgment.

Of these nations, Tarshish (Tartessus) was at the furthest limit westward, Pul and Lud, or rather Phut and Lud, at the furthest limit southward, Tubal and Javan at the furthest limit northward, Pul, which occurs nowhere else in Scripture as a geographic name, is almost certainly a wrong reading for Phut, which occurs in <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, and also three times (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>) in connection with Lud.
