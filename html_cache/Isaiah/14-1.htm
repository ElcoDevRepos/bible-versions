The name "Jacob" is used to remind readers of the patriarchal roots of the nation, tracing back to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Compassion here signifies God's willingness to forgive and restore, despite Israel's repeated disobedience. This theme of divine compassion is echoed throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God is described as "compassionate and gracious."<p><b>once again He will choose Israel</b><br>This indicates a reaffirmation of God's covenant with Israel. Despite their exile and punishment due to sin, God promises to renew His choice of Israel as His people. This reflects the unconditional nature of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>, where Israel is chosen not because of their righteousness but because of God's love and the oath He swore to their ancestors. This also foreshadows the New Covenant, where God's people are chosen through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25-29</a>.<p><b>and settle them in their own land.</b><br>This phrase refers to the promise of restoration and return from exile. Historically, this was fulfilled when the Israelites returned from Babylonian captivity, as recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The land is central to the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), symbolizing God's provision and blessing. This also points to eschatological hope, where believers anticipate a new heaven and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).<p><b>The foreigner will join them</b><br>This phrase signifies the inclusion of Gentiles into the blessings of Israel, a theme that becomes more explicit in the New Testament. Isaiah often speaks of a future where nations will come to worship the God of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). This foreshadows the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the breaking down of the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>and unite with the house of Jacob.</b><br>This unity suggests a future where ethnic and cultural barriers are transcended, pointing to the unity found in Christ. The "house of Jacob" implies a spiritual family, which is expanded to include all who believe in Jesus, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>. This unity is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>), ultimately realized in Jesus Christ.<div

Paul echoes this in <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>: &#8220;God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew.&#8221;<p>- The phrase assures the remnant that divine selection continues regardless of Assyrian or Babylonian oppression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and settle them in their own land</b><p>- This points to a literal, geographical return&#8212;fulfilled partially after the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) and ultimately looking forward to a future regathering foretold in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-22</a>.<p>- &#8220;their own land&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s covenant promise first given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>.<p>- The settling carries ideas of peace and security (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>), contrasting sharply with the displacement caused by enemy nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The foreigner will join them</b><p>- Gentile inclusion is anticipated here, foreshadowing promises like <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a> and fulfilled in Christ as <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a> brings believing Gentiles into the commonwealth of Israel.<p>- Rather than replacing Israel, foreigners &#8220;join,&#8221; indicating partnership and shared worship of the one true God (<a href="/zechariah/8-23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p>- This dismantles ethnocentric pride and highlights God&#8217;s global redemptive plan first hinted in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and unite with the house of Jacob</b><p>- &#8220;Unite&#8221; suggests harmony and shared covenant blessings, echoing passages such as <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3-5</a> where nations come to Israel&#8217;s light.<p>- The &#8220;house of Jacob&#8221; remains intact; Gentiles attach to it, not vice versa. <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a> speaks of wild branches grafted into the cultivated olive tree.<p>- The picture is one redeemed people worshiping the Lord in unity (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>), fulfilling God&#8217;s intent that Israel be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a> reassures God&#8217;s covenant people that despite judgment, He still loves, chooses, and restores them to their land.

The downfall of Babylon was certain, because without it the mercy of the Lord to Israel could not be manifested. The whole section is an anticipation of the great argument of Isaiah 40-66, and the question of its authorship stands or falls on the same grounds.<p><span class= "bld">The strangers shall be joined with them . . .</span>--The thought is one specially characteristic of the later prophecies of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm" title="One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand to the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.">Isaiah 44:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3-6</a>), but is prominent in the earlier also (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>). In later Hebrew the same words came to be applied to the proselytes who are conspicuous in the apostolic age (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>; <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>), and in them, as before in the adhesion and support of the Persian kings and satraps, and as afterwards in the admission of the Gentiles into the kingdom of the Christ, we may trace successive fulfilments of the prophet's words. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-23.</span> - THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL, AND HER SONG OF TRIUMPH OVER BABYLON. The destruction of Babylon is to be followed by the restoration of Israel, with the good will of the nations, and by their exercising rule over their late oppressors (vers. 1, 2). In this time of rest and refreshment they will sing a song of triumph over Babylon. The song extends from ver. 4 to ver. 23. It consists of five stanzas, or strophes, each comprising seven long lines, after which there is a brief epode, or epilogue, of a different character. This epode is comprised in vers. 22 and 23. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob.</span> God's purpose of mercy upon Israel requires, as its preliminary, the destruction of Babylon, and may be considered as the final cause of that destruction. His desire to have mercy on Israel <span class="accented">soon</span> is the reason why the days of Babylon are not prolonged (see <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Will yet choose Israel</span>. The Captivity was a rejection of Israel from their position as a favored race - God's peculiar people; their restoration was a fresh "choice" of them out of all the nations of the world, a free act of grace on his part; to which they had no claim or right whatsoever. <span class="cmt_word">And set them in their own land;</span> or, <span class="accented">on their own ground</span>. The land that once was theirs, but which they had forfeited by their disobedience, could only become "their own" again by a fresh gift from God. <span class="cmt_word">The strangers shall be joined with them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the stranger shall join himself to them</span>. On the return from the Captivity, there would be an influx of proselytes from the nations, who would voluntarily join themselves to those whom they saw favored both by God and man (comp. <a href="/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>). Though the Jews did not commonly seek proselytes, they readily received such as offered themselves. A further fulfillment of the prophecy took place when the Gentiles flocked into the Church of God after the coming of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/14-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will have compassion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;ra&#183;&#7717;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7355.htm">Strong's 7355: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fondle, to love, to compassionate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and choose</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
