The use of "Jacob" and "Israel" emphasizes both the personal and national aspects of God's promises. Historically, this reflects God's commitment to His people, chosen to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). Theologically, it underscores the idea of election, where God chooses individuals or nations for His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-13</a>.<p><b>I call you by name</b><br>This indicates a personal and intentional act by God, signifying His sovereignty and foreknowledge. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45</a>, this refers to Cyrus, the Persian king, whom God names and appoints to fulfill His purposes. This is significant because it demonstrates God's control over history and His ability to use even those who do not know Him to accomplish His will. The calling by name is reminiscent of God's intimate knowledge of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>.<p><b>I have given you a title of honor</b><br>The title of honor refers to Cyrus being called "His anointed" in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, a term usually reserved for Israelite kings and priests. This highlights the unique role Cyrus plays in God's plan to restore Israel from Babylonian captivity. Historically, Cyrus is known for his decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). This act of honoring a foreign king underscores the theme of God's universal sovereignty.<p><b>though you have not known Me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Cyrus, despite being used by God, does not have a personal relationship with Him. It illustrates the concept that God can use anyone, regardless of their spiritual state, to fulfill His divine purposes. This is a reminder of God's omnipotence and the idea that His plans are not limited by human understanding or acknowledgment. It also serves as a contrast to Israel, who is expected to know and worship God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the patriarch of the Israelites, often symbolizing the nation of Israel as a whole.

Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it may be "a light to lighten the Gentiles;" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end.
