Tarshish is often associated with the western Mediterranean, possibly modern-day Spain. In biblical times, ships of Tarshish were renowned for their size and ability to undertake long voyages, symbolizing economic power and international trade. The judgment against these ships signifies God's sovereignty over human commerce and the futility of relying on material wealth. This phrase connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, where Tarshish is listed as a trading partner of Tyre, emphasizing the extensive trade networks of the ancient world. The judgment here reflects a broader theme in Isaiah of God humbling human pride and self-sufficiency.<p><b>and against every stately vessel</b><br>The term "stately vessel" suggests grandeur and human achievement in shipbuilding, representing human pride and technological advancement. In the ancient Near East, ships were symbols of power and prestige, often used by empires to project their influence across seas. The judgment against these vessels underscores the theme of divine supremacy over human accomplishments. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The imagery of ships being judged can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate authority over all creation, as He calms the seas and commands nature (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human glory in contrast to the eternal sovereignty of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

Immediately afterward, verses 6-22 pivot to a coming day when God will humble human pride. Verse 16 sits in that section, sandwiched between judgments on lofty cedars, high mountains, and fortified walls (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-15</a>). The focus is the same: nothing humanity trusts in&#8212;whether natural, architectural, or nautical&#8212;will stand when the LORD rises to shake the earth (<a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against every ship of Tarshish</b><p>&#8220;Tarshish&#8221; signified the farthest edge of the known world and immense commercial wealth.

Jonah tried to flee there to escape God&#8217;s call (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>).

Think royal yachts, military fleets, and sparkling merchant ships. Isaiah lists them right alongside towers and fortified walls (<a href="/isaiah/2-15.htm">Isaiah 2:15</a>) to emphasize:<p>&#8226; Human technology and craftsmanship, however impressive, remain finite<p>&#8226; Naval might cannot shelter a nation from divine reckoning (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>)<p>&#8226; Beauty and elegance, while gifts from God, become idols when they replace dependence on Him<p><a href="/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17-19</a> echoes Isaiah&#8217;s warning: merchant captains and sailors weep as Babylon falls, watching their livelihood vanish &#8220;in a single hour.&#8221; God&#8217;s judgment exposes the emptiness of trusting in material splendor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the bigger picture of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2</a></b><p>Verse 16 contributes two essential truths embedded throughout the chapter:<p>1. The LORD alone will be exalted (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11, 17</a>). Any structure, commerce, or culture that competes for that glory will be brought low.<p>2. Judgment and hope intertwine. After everything proud is leveled, Zion stands as the beacon where people learn righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>). God dismantles self-reliance so He can rebuild lives on His unshakable foundation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how it speaks today</b><p>&#8226; Modern &#8220;ships of Tarshish&#8221; can be multinational corporations, technological marvels, or personal investment portfolios. They promise security yet remain vulnerable to the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Stately vessels&#8221; may be cutting-edge defenses or lavish lifestyles. When they displace simple trust in Christ, they become targets for divine correction.<p>&#8226; The passage calls believers to hold material resources loosely, stewarding them faithfully while anchoring hope in the One who rules wind and waves (<a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a> declares that God will act &#8220;against every ship of Tarshish, and against every stately vessel,&#8221; shattering the symbols of economic might and human achievement. In the coming day of the LORD, no enterprise, fleet, or fortune can shield humanity from His verdict. The verse magnifies the unrivaled supremacy of God, warning against idolatrous confidence in wealth or technology and inviting His people to rest their security in Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And upon all the ships of Tarshish.</span>--The words point to the commerce in the Red Sea carried on by the fleets of Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>); perhaps also to that in the Mediterranean with Tarshish, or Tartessus (Spain), as in <a href="/jonah/1-3.htm" title="But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.">Jonah 1:3</a>. The "ships of Tarshish" had come to be used generically for all ships of the class used in such commerce, whether crossing the Mediterranean to Spain, or circumnavigating Africa, or passing over the Persian Gulf to Ophir.<p><span class= "bld">Upon all pleasant pictures.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon all imagery of delight </span>(Comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm" title="Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:">Numbers 33:52</a>.) The combination of the phrase with "the ships of Tarshish" suggests the inference that it includes the works of art which were brought by them from East and West. For these, it would seem, there was a mania among the higher classes in Jerusalem, like that which in later times has fastened upon china, or pictures, or carvings in ivory. So the ships of Solomon brought gold and silver, and "ivory and apes and peacocks" (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm" title="For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">1Kings 10:22</a>). The "ivory beds" of <a href="/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4</a>, the "gold rings set with the beryl," the "ivory overlaid with sapphires," the "pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold" of <a href="/context/songs/5-14.htm" title="His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.">Song of Solomon 5:14-15</a>, the precious things in the treasury of Hezekiah (<a href="/isaiah/39-2.htm" title="And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.">Isaiah 39:2</a>), may be taken as examples of this form of luxury. The aestheticism of the Roman Empire, of the <span class= "ital">Renaissance </span>of the fifteenth century, of the age of Louis XIV., of our own time and country, presents obvious parallels. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the ships of Tarshish.</span> "Ships of Tarshish" meant originally "ships built to sail to Tarshish;" but was used by the later writers for ships of a certain class or size (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>). Tarshish was Tartessus, in Spain, and voyages thither were regarded as long and dangerous (Herod., 1:163). Consequently, the ships which were built for the Tartessian trade were of unusual size and strength. Uzziah had "built [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> rebuilt] Elath," in the eastern arm of the Red Sea, early in his reign (<a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), and no doubt maintained a fleet there, as Jehoshaphat had done (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Elath remained in the possession of the Jews till the reign of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin, and restored to Edom (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all pleasant pictures</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">all pleasant imagery</span>. The exact word here translated "pictures" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament; but a cognate word is not uncommon. From the passages in which this cognate word occurs (especially <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>), it is concluded that works of art, of some sort or other, are intended. More than this can scarcely be determined. Dr. Kay thinks the term to include "sculptures and fresco-paintings." Mr. Cheyne translates "all delightful works of imagery." The sentiment is that the judgment of God will fall on the most valued contents of palaces and grand houses, no less than upon the forests and the mountains, the fortified places, and the national navy. <span class="accented">All</span> wilt be involved in one sweeping destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
