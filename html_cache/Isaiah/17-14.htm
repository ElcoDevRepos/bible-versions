In biblical times, evening was often a time of vulnerability, as darkness brought uncertainty and fear. The sudden terror suggests a divine intervention that catches the enemies of God's people off guard. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where God acts decisively against those who oppose His will, such as the sudden destruction of the Assyrian army in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. The imagery of evening turning to terror can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual darkness that precedes judgment.<p><b>Before morning, they are no more!</b><br>The phrase indicates the complete and rapid destruction of the enemies, emphasizing the power and swiftness of God's judgment. The transition from evening to morning symbolizes a new beginning for God's people, free from their oppressors. This mirrors the deliverance narratives found throughout the Bible, such as the Exodus, where the Israelites were freed from Egyptian bondage overnight (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-31</a>). The idea of enemies being "no more" also points to the ultimate victory of God over evil, a theme echoed in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God promises to wipe away every tear and eliminate death and suffering.<p><b>This is the portion of those who loot us</b><br>The term "portion" refers to the fate or destiny allotted to those who act against God's people. Looting, in the biblical context, often involved not just theft but also violence and desecration. This phrase underscores the principle of divine justice, where those who harm God's people will face retribution. The concept of a "portion" is reminiscent of the biblical idea of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. It serves as a warning that actions against God's covenant community will not go unpunished.<p><b>and the lot of those who plunder us.</b><br>The word "lot" here is synonymous with destiny or outcome, reinforcing the certainty of divine justice. Plundering implies a deeper level of aggression and exploitation, often associated with warfare and conquest. This phrase highlights the assurance that God will defend His people and bring justice to those who exploit and oppress them. The use of "lot" can also be seen in the context of inheritance, where the righteous receive their promised inheritance from God, while the wicked receive their due punishment. This is consistent with the biblical theme of divine retribution, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>, where the Lord laughs at the wicked, knowing their day is coming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel and Judah, warning them of impending judgment and offering hope for future restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital of Syria, often representing the nation itself, which was a significant power and adversary of Israel during Isaiah's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which was often in conflict with surrounding nations, including Syria.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrians.htm">Assyrians</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its military might and conquests, often used by God as an instrument of judgment against other nations, including Israel and Syria.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunderers.htm">Plunderers</a></b><br>Those who attack and loot, representing the enemies of God's people who face divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of the rise and fall of nations.

God will help her when morning dawns.&#8221;).<p>- Similar dawn deliverances appear when the Red Sea closed over Pharaoh&#8217;s army &#8220;at daybreak&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>) and when Sennacherib&#8217;s soldiers lay dead &#8220;early in the morning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>).<p>- For God&#8217;s people, night often marks the limit of distress, while morning ushers in relief (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). For the enemies described here, morning confirms their annihilation.<p>- The phrase reinforces that divine judgment does not drag on; it fulfills precisely what God has decreed, echoing <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2&#8211;3</a> where &#8220;destruction comes upon them suddenly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the portion of those who loot us and the lot of those who plunder us.</b><p>- &#8220;Portion&#8221; and &#8220;lot&#8221; speak of an allotted inheritance; the oppressor&#8217;s &#8220;reward&#8221; is sudden obliteration (<a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22&#8211;23</a>, &#8220;Do not rob the poor&#8230; for the LORD will take up their case&#8221;).<p>- God promised Abraham, &#8220;I will curse those who curse you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Isaiah shows that promise still in force: anyone who preys on God&#8217;s covenant people inherits ruin.<p>- <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a> echoes the same principle: &#8220;As you have done, it will be done to you; your recompense will return upon your own head.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> calls God&#8217;s people &#8220;the apple of His eye&#8221;; to plunder them is to provoke Him personally.<p>- The verse therefore assures believers that every act of oppression is noted and will be answered&#8212;either historically, as with Assyria, or finally when the Lord returns (<a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a> promises that God can dismantle hostile forces as quickly as night turns to dawn.
