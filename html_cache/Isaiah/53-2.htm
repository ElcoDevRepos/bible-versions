The imagery of a "tender shoot" indicates vulnerability and gentleness, reflecting the humble circumstances of Jesus' birth and upbringing. The phrase "before Him" signifies that this growth was under God's watchful eye, emphasizing divine approval and purpose. This imagery connects to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as a "shoot from the stump of Jesse," indicating a new beginning from the line of David.<p><b>and like a root out of dry ground</b><br>The "dry ground" symbolizes a spiritually barren environment, reflecting the state of Israel at the time of Jesus' coming. Despite the lack of spiritual nourishment, the Messiah emerges, signifying hope and renewal. This imagery can be linked to the historical context of Israel under Roman occupation, where spiritual vitality seemed scarce. The root's emergence in such conditions highlights the miraculous nature of the Messiah's appearance and mission.<p><b>He had no stately form or majesty to attract us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ordinary and unremarkable appearance of the Messiah, contrasting with expectations of a regal and majestic king. It underscores the idea that the Messiah's significance is not found in outward appearances but in His divine mission and character. This aligns with <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God reminds Samuel that He looks at the heart, not outward appearances. Jesus' life and ministry focused on inner transformation rather than external grandeur.<p><b>no beauty that we should desire Him</b><br>The lack of physical beauty or attractiveness suggests that the Messiah's appeal is not based on worldly standards. This challenges cultural norms that value physical appearance and status. Instead, the Messiah's true beauty lies in His sacrificial love and redemptive work. This connects to <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where Jesus is described as taking the form of a servant and humbling Himself, highlighting the depth of His love and commitment to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Christians traditionally interpret as referring to Jesus Christ.

What he means is that "the Servant" would have no splendid surroundings, no regal pomp nor splendour - nothing about him to attract men's eyes, or make them think him anything extraordinary. It is impossible to suppose that there was not in his appearance something of winning grace and quiet majesty. but it was of a kind that was not adapted to draw the gaze of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">And when we shall see him</span>.
