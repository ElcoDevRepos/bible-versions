In biblical times, lambs grazing freely indicated a time of peace and prosperity. The imagery of lambs is also significant in the Bible, often representing God's people or the followers of Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a> where Jesus refers to Himself as the Good Shepherd. The mention of "their own pastures" implies a restoration of rightful ownership and divine provision, echoing <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides for His flock.<p><b>and strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a reversal of fortunes, where the once-wealthy are no longer present, and outsiders benefit from what remains. Historically, this can be seen as a consequence of divine judgment, where the prideful and unjust are brought low, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>. The term "strangers" may refer to foreigners or those not originally part of the community, indicating a shift in social order. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of God humbling the proud and exalting the humble, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>. The "ruins of the wealthy" serve as a stark reminder of the temporal nature of earthly riches and the ultimate sovereignty of God over all nations and peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lambs.htm">Lambs</a></b><br>Symbolic of innocence and purity, often representing God's people or those who are humble and righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pastures.htm">Pastures</a></b><br>Represents a place of provision and safety, often used metaphorically for spiritual nourishment and peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/strangers.htm">Strangers</a></b><br>Refers to foreigners or those outside the covenant community, possibly indicating those who will benefit from the downfall of the unfaithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruins.htm">Ruins</a></b><br>The aftermath of judgment, symbolizing the destruction of what was once prosperous due to disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wealthy.htm">The Wealthy</a></b><br>Those who have prospered materially but have neglected spiritual and moral responsibilities, leading to their downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_provision.htm">God's Justice and Provision</a></b><br>God's judgment is just, and He provides for those who remain faithful and humble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Material wealth and status are fleeting;

Lambs symbolize simple, innocent life reclaiming ground once dominated by arrogant land-grabbers (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The pastures are &#8220;their own,&#8221; stressing God&#8217;s reversal of human schemes; property seized by the wealthy now lies open to creatures that make no claims of ownership (<a href="/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar prophetic scenes show abandoned estates becoming grazing fields (<a href="/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23-25</a>; 32:13-14), underscoring the certainty of God&#8217;s word: judgment strips away human pride, yet creation endures.<p>&#8226; For the faithful remnant, this image quietly reassures that God still sustains life even amid national collapse (<a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy</b><p>&#8220;and strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy&#8221;

Their presence in the ruined mansions echoes covenant warnings that outsiders would consume what the unfaithful had stored up (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;ruins&#8221; point to total desolation&#8212;once-lavish vineyards and houses now lie empty (<a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>).

The verse affirms that the Lord dismantles human pride, vindicates His covenant warnings, and preserves life for those who trust Him, urging us to walk humbly and steward His gifts with obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Then shall the lambs feed after their manner.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">feed even as on their pasture. </span>The meaning is clear enough. The lands that have been gained by oppression shall, in the day of retribution, become common pasture ground instead of being reserved for the parks and gardens of the rich; and strangers--i.e., invaders, Philistines, Assyrians, or nomadic tribes--shall devour the produce (<a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm" title="Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.">Isaiah 1:7</a>). Possibly, however, the "lambs" may stand for the poor and meek, as in contrast with the "fat ones" of the earth. The LXX. version follows a different reading in the second clause, and gives "kids" instead of "strangers."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the lambs feed</span>. Dr. Kay takes the "lambs" to be the remnant of Israel that survived the judgment, who will feed freely, cared for by the good Shepherd; but the parallelism so generally affected by Isaiah seems to require a meaning more consonant with the later clause of the verse. Most commentators, therefore, expound the passage literally, "Then shall lambs feed [on the desolated estates of the covetous]" (see vers. 8-10). <span class="cmt_word">After their manner</span>; or, <span class="accented">after their own guidance</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at their pleasure, as they list (so Lowth and Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</span> <span class="accented">Goim</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nomad tribes, shall consume the produce of the wasted fields once possessed by the Hebrew grandees. Ewald proposes to make the verse immediately follow ver. 10; but this is not necessary. The occupation of their lands by wandering tribes, Arabs and others, was a part of the punishment that fell on all the nobles, not on those only who accumulated large estates. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Lambs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3532.htm">Strong's 3532: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will graze</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
