This imagery is used to depict the futility and vulnerability of Babylon's magicians and astrologers, who are unable to withstand God's judgment. The comparison to stubble emphasizes their impending destruction and the swiftness with which it will occur, as stubble is quickly consumed by fire.<p><b>the fire will burn them up.</b><br>Fire is often a symbol of God's judgment and purification throughout Scripture. Here, it signifies the complete and inevitable destruction of Babylon's false prophets and their practices. This aligns with other biblical passages where fire represents divine retribution, such as in Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and the refining fire of God's judgment (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame.</b><br>This phrase underscores the helplessness of Babylon's wise men in the face of divine judgment. Despite their knowledge and practices, they are powerless to save themselves. This reflects the broader biblical theme that human wisdom and strength are insufficient against God's sovereign will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, "There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD."<p><b>There will be no coals to warm them</b><br>The absence of coals signifies a lack of comfort or refuge. In ancient Near Eastern culture, fire was a source of warmth and security. The imagery here suggests that Babylon's trusted sources of comfort and protection will fail them. This can be seen as a metaphor for the false security offered by idols and false gods, which are unable to provide true safety or salvation.<p><b>or fire to sit beside.</b><br>This phrase further emphasizes the totality of Babylon's desolation. In a cultural context where fire was central to daily life, the lack of a fire to sit beside indicates complete abandonment and isolation. It serves as a stark contrast to the warmth and fellowship often associated with a communal fire, highlighting the loneliness and despair that accompany divine judgment. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of separation from God as the ultimate consequence of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire being addressed in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47</a>.
