These festivals were times of communal worship, remembrance, and thanksgiving, often involving music and singing (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14-17</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>). The imagery suggests a future time of deliverance and restoration for God's people, reminiscent of the joy experienced during these sacred times. Singing was a key element in worship and celebration, reflecting a heart full of gratitude and reverence for God's mighty acts.<p><b>and your heart will rejoice</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of emotions and will. Rejoicing from the heart indicates a deep, genuine joy that comes from experiencing God's salvation and faithfulness. This joy is not superficial but rooted in the assurance of God's promises and His presence among His people. The prophetic context suggests a future time when Israel will experience God's deliverance, leading to heartfelt rejoicing (<a href="/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>).<p><b>like one who walks to the music of a flute</b><br>The flute, a common instrument in ancient Israel, was often used in joyful and celebratory contexts (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>). Walking to the music of a flute suggests a procession or pilgrimage, possibly to Jerusalem for worship. This imagery conveys a sense of harmony and peace, as the people are led by the joyful sound of music, symbolizing the guidance and presence of God in their journey.<p><b>going up to the mountain of the LORD</b><br>The "mountain of the LORD" refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel where the temple was located (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>). Going up to this mountain signifies approaching God's presence, a place of worship, revelation, and divine encounter. This ascent is not just physical but spiritual, representing a return to God and His covenant promises.<p><b>to the Rock of Israel</b><br>The "Rock of Israel" is a metaphor for God, emphasizing His strength, stability, and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/22-32.htm">2 Samuel 22:32</a>). In a world of uncertainty, God is the unchanging foundation upon which His people can rely. This title also points to God's role as protector and deliverer, providing security and refuge for Israel. The imagery of a rock is often associated with Christ in the New Testament, who is described as the spiritual rock that provides life and sustenance (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Singing is evidence that fear has been replaced with faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as on the night of a holy festival</b><p>Festival nights&#8212;Passover, Tabernacles, Purim&#8212;were occasions of shared memory and joy. <a href="/exodus/12-42.htm">Exodus 12:42</a> calls Passover &#8220;a night of vigil for the LORD,&#8221; while <a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14-15</a> commands Israel to &#8220;be joyful at your feast.&#8221; Isaiah points back to those high moments of communal celebration to picture the intensity of coming gladness.

The destination is not merely a place but a Person&#8212;the steadfast Rock who secures, protects, and fulfills every promise.

In later times, and probably, therefore, in earlier, it had a night-ritual of special solemnity, the court of the Temple being illuminated with a great candelabrum.

So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-25.htm" title="In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.">Ezekiel 45:25</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt.">2Chronicles 7:8-9</a>). The second clause of the verse completes the picture, by introducing the day-ritual of the procession of pilgrims from the country, bringing their firstfruits and playing on their flutes. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have a song</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to you will</span> [<span class="accented">then</span>] <span class="accented">be a song</span>.

Perhaps a special reference is intended to the Pass-over-feast, which commenced with an even-tag or night celebration (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6, 8, 42</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>). Or perhaps "Isaiah is not referring to one feast more than another" (Cheyne), night-rituals belonging to all toasts, since the day commenced with the sunset. The Passover-song consisted of <a href="/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113</a>. - 118. <span class="cmt_word">And as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord</span>. Joyful processions from the country districts to Jerusalem are alluded to. These were commonly headed by a piper or a band of pipers (Vitringa). They took place several times in the year - at each of the three great feasts, and irregularly when any district sent up its firstfruits to the temple treasury (<a href="/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35-37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the Mighty One of Israel</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">the Rock of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Jehovah (comp. <a href="/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; and see also <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2, 31, 46</a>, etc.). The idea embodied in the metaphor is rather that of an unfailing refuge than of mere might and power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/30-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will sing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
