"In that day" is a prophetic term often used in the Old Testament to denote a future time of divine intervention or judgment. The imagery of roaring like the sea suggests overwhelming power and chaos, reminiscent of the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions that brought destruction to Israel and Judah. The sea is often used in Scripture to symbolize chaos and uncontrollable forces (e.g., <a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-3</a>). This can also be seen as a type of the final judgment, where nations will face God's wrath.<p><b>If one looks over the land, he will see darkness and distress;</b><br>Darkness and distress are common symbols of God's judgment and the absence of His favor. In the biblical context, darkness often represents confusion, evil, and divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>, <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>). The distress indicates the suffering and turmoil that accompany such judgment. Historically, this reflects the devastation brought by foreign armies, leading to a loss of hope and security. This imagery is also echoed in the New Testament, where darkness is associated with spiritual blindness and separation from God (e.g., <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>).<p><b>even the light will be obscured by clouds.</b><br>Light is typically a symbol of God's presence, truth, and salvation (e.g., <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The obscuring of light by clouds signifies a withdrawal of divine favor and guidance, leading to spiritual and moral confusion. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual darkness that would envelop the world before the coming of Christ, the true Light (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). The clouds may also symbolize the impending judgment that looms over the people, as seen in other prophetic writings (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, representing the Southern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>A prophetic event often associated with judgment and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the overwhelming and chaotic nature of the coming judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness_and_distress.htm">Darkness and Distress</a></b><br>Symbolic of the spiritual and physical consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br><a href="/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a> serves as a sobering reminder of God's righteous judgment against sin.

Here Isaiah gathers up every warning he has sounded in chapter 5 and stamps it with certainty: judgment is not hypothetical; it arrives on a calendar date set by God. Because Scripture is trustworthy, we read this not as poetic exaggeration but as an announcement that the consequences of covenant rebellion will land in real space and time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will roar over it</b><p>The &#8220;they&#8221; points back to the army God whistles for in <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>&#8212;historically Assyria, prophetically every instrument God may use.

Jesus taps this imagery when He predicts &#8220;distress of nations&#8221; before His return (<a href="/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25-26</a>), underscoring the continuing relevance of Isaiah&#8217;s warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even the light will be obscured by clouds</b><p>The reads, &#8220;Even the light will be obscured by clouds,&#8221; portraying a sky so thick with storm that noon feels like midnight.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>: &#8220;I will cover the heavens and darken their stars.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>: &#8220;The sun became black as sackcloth.&#8221;<p>Creation itself seems to mourn when God&#8217;s righteous wrath falls, aligning with <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, where the whole creation groans under the weight of human sin.

It teaches that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warnings are dated appointments, not idle threats.<p>&#8226; His instruments of discipline are overwhelming but never out of His control.<p>&#8226; Sin turns the brightest noon into midnight, yet the hidden sun hints at hope for those who repent.<p>Reading this verse today calls believers to heed every divine warning, trust the LORD&#8217;s sovereign hand over history, and cling to the promise that after the storm, the light of His salvation will break through the clouds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">They shall roar against them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">there is a roaring over him. </span>The verb is the same as in the previous verse, and points therefore to the shout and tramp of the armies.
