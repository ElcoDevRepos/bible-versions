The cedar's strength and longevity symbolize human pride and self-reliance, which are often contrasted with reliance on God. In biblical history, cedars from Lebanon were used in the construction of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), representing human efforts to create something lasting and significant.<p><b>or retrieves a cypress or oak.</b><br>Cypress and oak trees were also significant in the ancient Near East, known for their strength and utility. Oaks, in particular, were associated with places of worship and idolatry (<a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>). The mention of these trees highlights the futility of idol-making, as they are merely part of God's creation, yet are used by humans to create objects of worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the folly of idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<p><b>He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the natural process of growth, which is ultimately under God's control. The forest represents the world, where many things grow and thrive, yet humans often take credit for what is inherently a divine process. The imagery of trees growing strong can also be seen as a metaphor for human pride and self-sufficiency, which is ultimately futile without God (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>).<p><b>He plants a laurel,</b><br>The laurel tree, known for its evergreen leaves and aromatic qualities, was often associated with victory and honor in ancient cultures. Planting a laurel could symbolize human attempts to achieve glory and success through their own efforts. In a biblical context, true honor and victory come from God, not from human endeavors (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<p><b>and the rain makes it grow.</b><br>Rain is a symbol of God's provision and blessing throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). This phrase underscores the dependence of all creation on God's sustaining power. While humans may plant and cultivate, it is ultimately God who provides the growth (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7</a>).

The second of the trees mentioned is more probably the ilex than the cypress, which does not grow either in Palestine or in Babylonia. Idols would be made of cedar on account of its fragrance, of flex and oak on account of their hardness and durability. Cedar was used as a material for carved figures in Egypt (Birch, 'Contents of British Museum,' p. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest</span>. The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay translates, "and he <span class="accented">encourages himself in</span> the trees of the forest," which conveys no very distinct idea; Delitzsch, "and he <span class="accented">chooses</span> for himself among the trees," etc., which is sufficiently clear, but scarcely obtainable from the Hebrew text; Knobel, "he makes himself secure among the trees" (by putting a mark on those which he intends to have), which imparts an idea certainly not contained in the original. <span class="cmt_word">He planteth an ash</span>. It is uncertain, and it does not greatly matter, what tree is intended. The point is that, before trees can grow up, they have to be planted, and that, for them to grow when planted, God's gift of rain is necessary (see the comment on ver. 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/44-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He cuts down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7733;&#183;r&#257;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
