In biblical context, "feet" often symbolize one's path or way of life. The imagery of running suggests a deliberate and enthusiastic pursuit of evil, reflecting a heart that is inclined towards sin. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a>, which warns against those who are quick to commit evil acts. The concept of "running to evil" contrasts with the call to walk in righteousness and follow God's commandments, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>they are swift to shed innocent blood.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the violence and injustice prevalent among the people. The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin, condemned throughout Scripture, including in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). Historically, this reflects the societal corruption and moral decay present in Israel at the time, where justice was often perverted. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate innocent blood shed by Jesus Christ, who was crucified despite His innocence, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>Their thoughts are sinful thoughts;</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the internal state of the people, emphasizing that their actions stem from a corrupt mind. Sinful thoughts lead to sinful actions, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>, where He explains that evil thoughts come from the heart. This highlights the biblical principle that transformation must begin internally, with a renewal of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). The pervasive nature of sin affects both thoughts and deeds, illustrating the need for divine intervention and redemption.<p><b>ruin and destruction lie in their wake.</b><br>The consequences of their sinful actions are ruin and destruction, both for themselves and for others. This phrase paints a picture of the devastation left behind by those who pursue evil. It serves as a warning of the inevitable judgment and chaos that result from a life of sin, reminiscent of the destruction that befell Israel due to their disobedience. The imagery of ruin and destruction is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate judgment and the need for salvation through Christ, who offers restoration and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

They cannot construct, their devices fall through, their "spinning" is to no purpose; but they can, in a rough and blind way, do enormous mischief. "Their feet run to evil" - rush to it at full speed - brook no delay, but hurry on into act. It is an easy thing to shed innocent blood; and those who are conscious of constructive impotence are very apt to seek compensation by doing destructive work, which at least shows that they have a power of some kind.
