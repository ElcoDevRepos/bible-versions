In biblical times, desert creatures and hyenas were seen as symbols of wilderness and desolation. The meeting of these creatures suggests a place devoid of human habitation, reflecting the judgment pronounced on Edom in the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where desolate lands are inhabited by wild animals (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). The presence of hyenas, scavengers by nature, underscores the idea of a land left to ruin and decay.<p><b>and one wild goat will call to another.</b><br>The wild goat, or "satyr" in some translations, is often associated with desolate places. In ancient Near Eastern culture, wild goats were considered elusive and untamed, symbolizing the chaotic and uninhabited nature of the wilderness. The calling of one wild goat to another suggests a communication or gathering in a place that is now their domain, further emphasizing the absence of human life. This imagery can be linked to the idea of spiritual barrenness and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>There the night creature will settle</b><br>The "night creature" is sometimes translated as "Lilith" or "screech owl," a figure associated with night and darkness. In Jewish folklore, Lilith is a demoness, but in the biblical context, it represents a creature of the night, symbolizing fear and the unknown. The settling of the night creature in this desolate place indicates a complete transformation from a once-thriving area to one dominated by darkness and spiritual desolation. This transformation serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>and find her place of repose.</b><br>The phrase "place of repose" suggests a finality and permanence to the desolation described. It indicates that the judgment is complete and irrevocable, with the land now serving as a resting place for creatures of the night. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for the ultimate fate of those who reject God's ways, finding themselves in a state of spiritual death and separation from God. The idea of repose also contrasts with the rest and peace promised to those who follow God, highlighting the stark difference between the outcomes of faithfulness and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/desert_creatures.htm">Desert Creatures</a></b><br>These are symbolic of desolation and abandonment, often representing unclean animals in biblical literature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hyenas.htm">Hyenas</a></b><br>Known for scavenging, they symbolize destruction and the aftermath of divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wild_goats.htm">Wild Goats</a></b><br>Often associated with wilderness and desolation, they represent the chaotic and untamed aspects of nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/night_creature.htm">Night Creature</a></b><br>Sometimes translated as "Lilith" or "screech owl," this figure is often associated with darkness and desolation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/place_of_repose.htm">Place of Repose</a></b><br>This indicates a place of rest or dwelling, highlighting the permanence of desolation in the context of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_judgment.htm">Understanding Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The imagery in <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a> serves as a vivid portrayal of God's judgment.
