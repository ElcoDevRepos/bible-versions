During this period, judges were leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and to guide them in righteousness. The restoration implies a divine intervention to bring back godly leadership, suggesting a time of renewal and reform. This promise of restoration is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God often pledges to restore His people to a state of faithfulness and justice.<p><b>and your counselors as at the beginning</b><br>Counselors in ancient Israel were advisors who provided wisdom and guidance to the leaders and the people. The reference to "the beginning" may allude to the early days of Israel's monarchy under leaders like King David, who sought God's guidance through prophets and wise counselors. This restoration of counselors signifies a return to divine wisdom and guidance, contrasting with the corrupt leadership that Isaiah often condemns. It underscores the importance of godly counsel in maintaining a just and righteous society.<p><b>After that you will be called the City of Righteousness</b><br>The transformation of the city, likely referring to Jerusalem, into a "City of Righteousness" signifies a profound moral and spiritual renewal. This change in identity reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to cleanse and purify His people. The term "righteousness" in the Hebrew context involves justice, ethical behavior, and adherence to God's laws. This transformation is not just a return to past glory but an elevation to a new standard of holiness and justice, aligning with prophetic visions of a future where God's kingdom is established on earth.<p><b>the Faithful City</b><br>The designation "Faithful City" indicates a community that is steadfast in its commitment to God and His covenant. This faithfulness contrasts sharply with the unfaithfulness and idolatry that Isaiah rebukes throughout his prophecies. The term suggests a city that embodies loyalty, trustworthiness, and devotion to God. This transformation is often seen as a type of the New Jerusalem described in Revelation, where God's presence dwells among a faithful people. It points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where His people live in harmony with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Refers to leaders who were responsible for maintaining justice and order in Israel.
