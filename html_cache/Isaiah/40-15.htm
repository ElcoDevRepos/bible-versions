In the ancient Near Eastern context, nations often boasted of their power and influence, yet here they are depicted as trivial. This imagery is meant to humble human pride and remind believers of God's sovereignty. The metaphor of a "drop in a bucket" suggests something negligible and inconsequential, highlighting the vastness of God's dominion over all creation.<p><b>they are considered a speck of dust on the scales;</b><br>The imagery of a "speck of dust" further illustrates the insignificance of the nations. In ancient times, scales were used for precise measurements, and a speck of dust would not affect the balance. This metaphor underscores the idea that human power and achievements are inconsequential in the grand scheme of God's eternal plan. It also reflects the biblical theme of God's omnipotence, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7-14</a>, where God's power over creation is extolled.<p><b>He lifts up the islands like fine dust.</b><br>The reference to "islands" can be understood as distant lands or nations, emphasizing God's control over the entire earth, including the remotest parts. The phrase "like fine dust" suggests ease and effortlessness, indicating that God's power is so great that even the most distant and seemingly significant places are easily managed by Him. This can be connected to the prophecy of God's ultimate authority over all nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97:1</a>, which declares God's reign over the earth. The imagery also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who will establish His kingdom over all nations, fulfilling God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.

"From nature," as Mr. Cheyne says, "we pass to history." If God is so great, so apart and by himself in relation to the material universe, what is he in relation to man? What are nations, compared to him, but "as a drop from a bucket," which drips from it, and is of no account? What are they, but as the small dust of the balance, which lies on it but does not disturb its equilibrium? They are absolutely "as nothing" (ver. 17) - vanity and emptiness, <span class="cmt_word">He taketh up the isles as a very little thing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he taketh up islands</span>, or perhaps <span class="accented">lands</span> generally. As he weighs mountains and hills in his balance (ver. 15), so he can take up in his own hands "lands," or "countries" (Cheyne), with all their inhabitants, and do with them as seemeth him good.
