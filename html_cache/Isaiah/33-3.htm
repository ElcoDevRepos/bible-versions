In biblical context, the voice of God is often associated with divine judgment and revelation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>, where God's voice is described as thunderous at Mount Sinai. The imagery of thunder signifies God's majesty and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence. Historically, thunder was often perceived as a manifestation of divine power across various cultures, reinforcing the idea that God's voice commands respect and obedience. This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological judgment where God's voice will once again cause upheaval among the nations, as seen in <a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3-4</a>.<p><b>the nations scatter when You rise.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the reaction of the nations to God's active intervention in history. The scattering of nations is a common biblical theme, symbolizing the disruption of human plans and the establishment of God's sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8</a> with the Tower of Babel. The phrase "when You rise" suggests a theophany, where God visibly acts in the world, reminiscent of instances like the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>). It also points to the ultimate rise of God in the final judgment, where all nations will be held accountable, as prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3-4</a>. This scattering can be seen as both a literal and spiritual dispersion, where those opposed to God are disbanded, while His people are gathered and protected.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the various groups or nations that are not part of Israel.

It highlights the universal scope of God's power and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thunder_of_your_voice.htm">The Thunder of Your Voice</a></b><br>This phrase symbolizes God's powerful and authoritative word. In the Hebrew context, "voice" (qol) often signifies divine communication that commands attention and action.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/you_rise.htm">You Rise</a></b><br>This refers to God taking action or intervening in human affairs. The imagery of God rising is often associated with His judgment and deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, warning them of impending judgment and offering hope for future restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's voice is not just a sound but a force that commands the universe.
