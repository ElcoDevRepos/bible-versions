In the biblical context, fasting was meant to be an act of humility and repentance before God. However, the Israelites were engaging in fasting as a mere ritual without genuine heart change. This echoes the prophetic call for true worship and obedience over empty rituals, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<p><b>a day for a man to deny himself,</b><br>Fasting traditionally involves self-denial, abstaining from food and sometimes other comforts, to focus on spiritual matters. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, fasting was a common practice during times of mourning, repentance, or seeking divine intervention. However, the emphasis here is on the superficial nature of their self-denial, lacking true spiritual depth and transformation.<p><b>to bow his head like a reed,</b><br>The imagery of a reed bending in the wind suggests an outward show of humility without inner conviction. This metaphor highlights the performative aspect of their fasting, where physical gestures are made without corresponding heart change. This can be compared to Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>, who fasted to be seen by others rather than to seek God sincerely.<p><b>and to spread out sackcloth and ashes?</b><br>Sackcloth and ashes were traditional symbols of mourning and repentance in the ancient Near East. They were used to express deep sorrow and contrition, as seen in the story of Job (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>) and the repentance of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). However, in this context, these actions are criticized as mere external displays without true repentance or change of heart.<p><b>Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the people to consider whether their actions align with what God truly desires. The "acceptable" fast is one that aligns with God's will, characterized by justice, mercy, and genuine repentance. This is further elaborated in the following verses (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>), which describe the kind of fasting that pleases God&#8212;acts of justice, kindness, and care for the needy. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God desires mercy and justice over ritual sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>, of the mechanical prostrations, which are as the waving of a bulrush in the breeze. The image suggests a new aspect of our Lord's statement, that the Baptist was not as "a reed shaken by the wind" (<a href="/matthew/11-7.htm" title="And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?">Matthew 11:7</a>), <span class= "ital">scil., </span>that his fasting was not outward and ceremonial, like that of the Pharisees.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it such a fast that I have chosen</span>, etc.? Do you suppose that such can be the fast commanded by me in the Law - a fast which is expressly called "a day for a man to afflict his soul"? Is afflicting one's soul simply bowing down one's head as a bulrush, and making one's couch on sackcloth and ashes? Surely it is much more than this.
