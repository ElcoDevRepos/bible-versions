In the context of Isaiah, it refers to a time when God will act decisively in the affairs of nations, particularly concerning Judah and its enemies.<p><b>the LORD will whistle</b><br>The imagery of God whistling suggests a sovereign command over creation, akin to a shepherd calling his flock. It emphasizes God's control over nations and nature, summoning them to fulfill His purposes. This reflects God's authority and the ease with which He orchestrates events.<p><b>to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile</b><br>Flies symbolize swarms, often associated with pestilence or overwhelming numbers. The reference to the Nile points to Egypt, a significant power in the ancient Near East. Historically, Egypt was both a threat and a potential ally to Israel, and this imagery suggests an invasion or influence from Egypt, possibly as a form of judgment or pressure on Judah.<p><b>and to the bees in the land of Assyria</b><br>Bees are known for their aggression and persistence, symbolizing the formidable and relentless nature of the Assyrian empire. Assyria was a dominant force during Isaiah's time, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. This phrase indicates an impending threat from Assyria, which historically conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel and posed a significant threat to Judah.<p><b>in the land of Assyria</b><br>Assyria was a major empire located in what is now northern Iraq. It was known for its advanced military technology and brutal tactics. The mention of Assyria highlights the geopolitical realities of Isaiah's time, where Assyria was a looming threat to the smaller nations of the region, including Judah. This also foreshadows the eventual Assyrian invasion and the challenges faced by the people of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who orchestrates events and uses nations to fulfill His purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fly.htm">The Fly</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Egyptian forces, representing a distant threat that God will summon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bee.htm">The Bee</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Assyrian forces, representing another threat that God will call upon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile.htm">The Nile</a></b><br>The great river of Egypt, indicating the source of the Egyptian threat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire to the northeast of Israel, known for its military might and aggression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and uses them to accomplish His divine purposes.

The context (<a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1&#8211;17</a>) describes a nervous king Ahaz, political intrigue, and the sign of Immanuel. By verse 18 the scene shifts from comfort to coming discipline.<p>&#8226; &#8220;That day&#8221; points to the time when both Egypt and Assyria would be unleashed against Judah, fulfilling the warning of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49&#8211;52</a>.<p>&#8226; Just four chapters earlier, Isaiah had used a similar marker: &#8220;In that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>). The repetition assures us of God&#8217;s precise timetable&#8212;He alone sets the calendar of events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD will whistle</b><p>To &#8220;whistle&#8221; is to summon. The LORD does not plead or negotiate; He commands.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a> echoes the idea: &#8220;He lifts up a banner for distant nations and whistles for them from the ends of the earth,&#8221; underscoring how effortlessly God gathers foreign powers.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/10-8.htm">Zechariah 10:8</a> shows the same verb used positively&#8212;He whistles for His people to gather. The contrast reminds us that the same sovereign call can bless or judge depending on the audience.<p>&#8226; The picture is vivid and literal: God&#8217;s soft signal&#8212;no trumpet blast needed&#8212;moves empires. His authority is absolute, just as <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a> declares, &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile</b><p>&#8220;Flies&#8221; represent Egypt&#8217;s armies, countless and irritating, streaming in from the remotest branches of the Nile Delta.<p>&#8226; Egypt had once been plagued by literal flies (<a href="/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-24</a>). Now God would direct a different swarm&#8212;soldiers&#8212;toward Judah.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Farthest streams&#8221; highlights distance: even those far from Judah&#8217;s borders respond instantly to God&#8217;s call, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>, &#8220;Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The swarm image signals harassment more than outright annihilation&#8212;persistent pressure that wears down resistance, as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> warns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to the bees in the land of Assyria</b><p>If Egyptian &#8220;flies&#8221; annoy, Assyrian &#8220;bees&#8221; attack with precision.

Their campaigns moved exactly as Isaiah foretold&#8212;summoned, not by geopolitical chance, but by divine whistle.<p>&#8226; The dual imagery&#8212;flies from the southwest, bees from the northeast&#8212;surrounds Judah, matching God&#8217;s earlier warning in <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-18</a> about judgment coming from multiple fronts when His people persist in unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a> paints a literal, prophetic scene: on God&#8217;s chosen day, He will merely &#8220;whistle,&#8221; and two great powers will converge on Judah&#8212;Egypt like swarming flies, Assyria like stinging bees. The verse showcases God&#8217;s effortless authority over nations, the certainty of covenant discipline, and the precision with which Scripture&#8217;s warnings come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The Lord shall hiss for the fly . . .</span>--See for the phrase the Note on <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:">Isaiah 5:26</a>. The legions of Egypt are represented by the flies that swarmed on the banks of the Nile (<a href="/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>, and possibly <a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm" title="Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:">Isaiah 18:1</a>), those of Assyria by the bees of their forests and their hills (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>).

The prophet tells them that each is fraught with danger. No help and much evil would come from such plans. Consistent in his policy from first to last, the one counsel he gives is that men should practise righteousness, and wait upon the Lord. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall hiss</span> (see <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>, and note <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt</span>. The "fly of Egypt," like the "bee of Assyria," represents the military force of the nation, which God summons to take part in the coming affliction of Judaea. The prophetic glance may be extended over the entire period of Judah's decadence, and the "<span class="accented">flies"</span> summoned may include those which clustered about Neco at Megiddo, and carried off Jehoahaz from Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-34</a>). There may be allusion also to Egyptian ravages in the reigns of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon. In any general review of the period we shall find it stated that, from the time of Sargon to that of Cyrus, Judaea was the battle-ground upon which the forces of Assyria (or Assyro-Babylonia) and Egypt contended for the empire of western Asia. The desolation of the land during this period was produced almost as much by the Egyptian "<span class="accented">fly</span> as by the Assyrian <span class="accented">bee</span>." The "rivers of Egypt" are the Nile, its branches, and perhaps the great canals by which its waters were distributed. <span class="cmt_word">The bee that is in the land of Assyria</span>. The choice of the terms "<span class="accented">bee"</span> and "<span class="accented">fly</span>," to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance.
