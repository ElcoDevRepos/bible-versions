In the context of <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10</a>, God is addressing the arrogance of Assyria, which He used as an instrument of judgment against Israel. The axe symbolizes Assyria, and the one who swings it represents God. This imagery underscores the sovereignty of God over nations and leaders, reminding us of similar themes in <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-23</a>, where Babylon is described as God's war club. Theologically, it highlights human pride and the folly of assuming autonomy from God, echoing the message of <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>Does a saw boast over him who saws with it?</b><br>The saw, like the axe, is a tool that cannot function independently. This rhetorical question further illustrates the foolishness of Assyria's pride. Historically, Assyria was a dominant military power, often boasting of its conquests. However, this passage reminds us that their success was permitted by God for His purposes. The imagery of the saw connects to the broader biblical theme of God using nations as instruments of His will, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-11</a>, where God raises the Chaldeans for judgment. It also serves as a warning against self-reliance and arrogance, aligning with <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, which states that God opposes the proud.<p><b>It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it,</b><br>The rod is another metaphor for Assyria, emphasizing the absurdity of an instrument acting independently of its wielder. In biblical times, a rod was often a symbol of authority and discipline, as seen in <a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a> with Moses' staff. This phrase suggests the reversal of roles, highlighting the ridiculousness of a tool attempting to control its master. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's control over history and His use of nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>, where God's sovereignty over the kingdoms of men is affirmed.<p><b>or a staff lifting him who is not wood!</b><br>The staff, like the rod, is a symbol of support and guidance. This phrase underscores the impossibility of an inanimate object exerting power over a living being. It serves as a final rebuke to Assyria's arrogance, reminding them of their role as mere instruments in God's hands. The reference to "him who is not wood" highlights the distinction between the Creator and His creation, echoing themes from <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3-8</a>, where idols are contrasted with the living God. This imagery also points to the ultimate authority of God, who alone is worthy of glory and honor, as seen in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

However, Assyria's pride and arrogance led to its own downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who uses nations and people as instruments to fulfill His divine purposes.

Just as an axe has no power unless a craftsman grips it, Assyria has no authority apart from God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement is rhetorical, inviting us to see how absurd it is for a tool to act as though it were in charge.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a> uses similar imagery&#8212;&#8220;You are My war club&#8230; with you I shatter nations&#8221;&#8212;underscoring that nations are instruments, not masters.<p>&#8226; When we remember <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> (&#8220;He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands&#8221;), any sense of human self-sufficiency melts away.

Likewise, Assyria&#8217;s pride in its conquests (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12-14</a>) ignores the One who empowered those victories. Scripture repeatedly warns against this delusion:<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>&#8212;God reduced Gideon&#8217;s army &#8220;lest Israel boast&#8230; &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30-32</a>&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s boast quickly met God&#8217;s humbling.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29-31</a>&#8212;&#8220;So that no flesh may boast in His presence&#8230; let him who boasts boast in the Lord.&#8221;<p>Whenever an individual or nation forgets its dependence on God, collapse follows. The saw without the Sawyer is useless metal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it</b><p>Isaiah piles on the absurdity: imagine a rod suddenly controlling the hand that holds it.

Like axes, saws, rods, and staffs, nations and individuals accomplish nothing apart from the Lord who wields them. Pride turns the created order upside down; humility restores it. Recognizing God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty frees us from boasting, keeps our confidence in Him, and calls us to serve as willing, obedient tools&#8212;never forgetting who truly swings the axe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Shall the ax boast itself . . .?</span>--The words spoken by the prophet as the mouthpiece of Jehovah remind us of the way in which Christian writers of the fifth century spoke of Attila as "the scourge of God."
