In the context of Isaiah, it refers to a time when God will act decisively in the history of Israel. This is a common prophetic expression indicating a significant event in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>the remnant of Israel</b><br>The concept of a remnant is central in the prophetic literature, referring to a small, faithful group that survives judgment. This remnant theme is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the stories of Noah and the exiles returning from Babylon. It emphasizes God's faithfulness in preserving a people for Himself despite widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>and the survivors of the house of Jacob</b><br>This phrase highlights the continuity of God's covenant with the patriarchs, specifically Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel. The survivors are those who endure through trials and judgment, maintaining their identity as God's chosen people. This reflects the historical context of the Assyrian invasion and the subsequent exile.<p><b>will no longer depend on him who struck them</b><br>This refers to the Assyrian empire, which God used as an instrument of judgment against Israel but also as a source of oppression. The phrase indicates a shift from reliance on foreign powers to trust in God. Historically, Israel often sought alliances with powerful nations like Assyria and Egypt, which led to their downfall.<p><b>but they will truly rely on the LORD</b><br>This marks a turning point where the remnant places their trust solely in God rather than in political or military alliances. It echoes the call to faithfulness found throughout the prophets and is a central theme in the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>the Holy One of Israel</b><br>This title for God emphasizes His uniqueness, purity, and covenantal relationship with Israel. It is a recurring title in Isaiah, underscoring God's holiness and His role as the protector and redeemer of His people. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's holiness and His call for His people to be holy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_israel.htm">The Remnant of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to the small group of Israelites who remain faithful to God after a period of judgment or calamity.
