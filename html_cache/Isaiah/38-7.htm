This phrase indicates that God is providing a tangible assurance to Hezekiah. Signs from the LORD are seen throughout Scripture, such as the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a> as a sign of God's covenant with Noah, or the virgin birth in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> as a sign of the coming Messiah. The use of signs underscores God's willingness to communicate and affirm His intentions to His people.<p><b>that He will do</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's active role in fulfilling His promises. It reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and sovereignty. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, God is responding to Hezekiah's prayer and is about to perform a miraculous act. This assurance is consistent with other biblical narratives where God intervenes in human history, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>) or the promise of restoration in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>.<p><b>what He has promised:</b><br>The promise in this context refers to God's assurance to Hezekiah that he will recover from his illness and that the city of Jerusalem will be delivered from the Assyrian threat. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's covenant faithfulness. Throughout Scripture, God is depicted as a promise-keeper, from His covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> to the new covenant in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>).

Here the coming miracle with the shadow (<a href="/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>) parallels earlier moments when the Lord supplied a visible pledge:<p>&#8226; Noah&#8217;s rainbow assured the earth would never again be destroyed by flood (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s fleece confirmed God&#8217;s call to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; miracles functioned as &#8220;signs&#8221; so that we might believe (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p>Each instance underscores a consistent pattern: the Creator, who cannot lie (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), sometimes adds a physical marker to foster settled confidence in His spoken promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to you</b><p>The sign was personal. King Hezekiah faced a death sentence, yet God singled him out for reassurance: &#8220;This is the sign to you&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord addressing individual fears:<p>&#8226; Moses received his own proof when his hand turned leprous and was healed (<a href="/exodus/4-6.htm">Exodus 4:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Thomas was invited to touch the risen Christ&#8217;s wounds (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>).<p>Salvation is global, yet the Lord still stoops to meet a single heart with bespoke encouragement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the LORD</b><p>The source of the sign secures its reliability. No human, no idol, no circumstance could guarantee Hezekiah&#8217;s recovery; only &#8220;the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a>) could overturn a terminal prognosis. Isaiah stresses that the pledge originates &#8220;from the LORD,&#8221; echoing earlier declarations:<p>&#8226; &#8220;The signs&#8230; the LORD performed in Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Nicodemus recognized Jesus&#8217; miracles came &#8220;from God&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p>Because the sign flows from the Sovereign One, its fulfillment is as certain as His character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He will do</b><p>A sign is not empty spectacle; it anticipates divine action. God links the visible with the verbal: what He shows, He will soon perform. <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> declares, &#8220;I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.&#8221; Likewise, Balaam admits, &#8220;Has He said, and will He not do it?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The shadow&#8217;s retreat on the stairway would announce that the unseen healing was already scheduled on heaven&#8217;s calendar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what He has promised</b><p>The promise to Hezekiah was clear: fifteen more years of life and protection of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5-6</a>). God&#8217;s integrity guarantees every promise, from Abraham&#8217;s countless descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5-6</a>) to Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>). Believers rest on a flawless track record: &#8220;Not one word has failed of all His good promise&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>), for &#8220;all the promises of God are &#8216;Yes&#8217; in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). The sign in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a> affirms the broader truth celebrated in <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>: &#8220;He who promised is faithful.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7</a> shows the Lord giving Hezekiah a personal, God-originated sign to anchor confidence that His spoken pledge would soon become reality.

In <a href="/context/2_kings/20-8.htm" title="And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?">2Kings 20:8-11</a> the story is more fully told. Hezekiah asks for a sign, and is offered his choice. Shall the shadow go forward or backward? With something of a child-like simplicity he chooses the latter, as the more difficult of the two. The sun-dial of Ahaz, probably, like his altar (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>), copied from Syrian or Assyrian art [the mention of a sun-clock is ascribed by Herodotus (ii. 109) to the Chaldaeans], would seem to have been of the form of an obelisk standing on <span class= "ital">steps </span>(the literal meaning of the Hebrew word for dial), and casting its shadow so as to indicate the time, each step representing an hour or half-hour. The nature of the phenomenon seems as curiously limited as that of the darkness of the crucifixion. There was no prolongation of the day in the rest of Palestine or Jerusalem, for the backward movement was limited to the step-dial. At Babylon no such phenomenon had been observed, and one ostensible purpose of Merodach-baladan's embassy was to investigate its nature (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2Chronicles 32:31</a>). An inquiry into the causation of a miracle is almost a contradiction in terms, but the most probable explanation of the fact recorded is that it was the effect of a supernatural, but exceedingly circumscribed, refraction. A prolonged after glow following on the sunset; and reviving for a time the brightness of the day, might produce an effect such as is described to one who gazed upon the step-dial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord</span>. It was the day of the free offering of "signs" by God to those whom his providence had placed at the head of his people. Ahaz had been offered a sign (<a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>), but had refused the offer made him (<a href="/isaiah/7-12.htm">Isaiah 7:12</a>); the Lord had then "himself" given him a sign." Hezekiah received a sign to assure him of the complete discomfiture of Sennacherib (<a href="/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>); an offer was here made him of a sign of a peculiar kind, and it was offered under peculiar conditions. We learn from 2 Kings that a choice was submitted to him - he was to determine whether time, as measured by a certain timepiece or clock, which was known as "the dial of Ahaz," should make a sudden leap forward - the shadow advancing ten degrees upon the dial (<a href="/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a>), or whether it should retire backwards, the shadow upon the same dial receding ten degrees. Hezekiah determined in favour of the latter <span class="accented">sign</span>, from its appearing to him the more difficult of accomplishment; and on his declaring his decision, the shadow receded to the prescribed distance. Time was rolled backward, or at any rate appeared to be rolled backward; and the king, seeing so great a miracle, accepted without hesitation the further predictions that had been made to him. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken</span>. By the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of this verse with the preceding, it would naturally be concluded that "the thing" to be done was the defence of Jerusalem; but ver. 22, which belongs properly to this part of the narrative, shows the contrary. Hezekiah had asked for a sign" that he should go up to the house of the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/38-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;zeh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
