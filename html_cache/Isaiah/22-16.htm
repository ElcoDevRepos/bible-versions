In the context of <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, Shebna is being rebuked for his pride and self-serving behavior. The question implies that Shebna's actions are inappropriate or unauthorized, suggesting a misuse of his position. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God questions individuals to reveal their hearts, similar to God's questioning of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>.<p><b>and who authorized you</b><br>This phrase highlights the issue of authority and legitimacy. Shebna's actions are being scrutinized because they lack divine approval. In biblical terms, authority is often derived from God, and leaders are expected to act in accordance with His will. This echoes the biblical principle that all authority is established by God, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>.<p><b>to carve out a tomb for yourself here&#8212;</b><br>The act of carving out a tomb signifies a desire for permanence and legacy. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, tombs were significant as they represented one's status and were often elaborate for the wealthy or powerful. Shebna's focus on his own tomb suggests vanity and a preoccupation with earthly status, contrasting with the biblical teaching that true legacy is found in serving God and others.<p><b>to chisel your tomb in the height</b><br>This phrase indicates the location of the tomb, likely in a prominent or elevated place, symbolizing pride and self-exaltation. In biblical literature, "height" often connotes arrogance or rebellion against God, as seen in the Tower of Babel narrative (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>). The emphasis on height underscores Shebna's desire for recognition and honor, which is condemned by God.<p><b>and cut your resting place in the rock?</b><br>The imagery of cutting a resting place in the rock suggests permanence and security. In biblical times, rock-cut tombs were durable and prestigious, often reserved for the elite. This act of securing a resting place in the rock can be seen as a metaphor for self-reliance and defiance against God's sovereignty. It contrasts with the biblical portrayal of God as the true "Rock" and refuge, as in <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the tomb of Jesus, who was laid in a rock-hewn tomb, yet His resurrection signifies victory over death and the futility of earthly ambitions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shebna.htm">Shebna</a></b><br>The steward or treasurer of the palace in Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah.

He had no "sepulchre of his fathers" to deck with fresh stateliness, and, like the kings and great ones of the earth (the kings of Sidon, the Pharaohs of Egypt, the kings of Assyria), had built one for himself, hollowed out of the wells (probably on one of the hills of Jerusalem), to be his own everlasting "habitation," his <span class= "ital">domus ?terna. </span>So in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>, the grave is the "long home" of man.

Tombs exist on the slopes of all the hills about Jerusalem, but are most numerous on the eastern side of the temple mount, which slopes steeply to the Kedron valley. A square-topped doorway leads into a chamber, generally square, from which recesses, six or seven feet long, two broad, and three high, are carried into the rock horizontally, either on a level with the floor, or with a platform, or shelf, halfway up one of the walls. These recesses have been called <span class="accented">loculi</span>. After a body had been placed in one, it was commonly closed by a stone, which fitted into the end, and thus shut off the body from the chamber.
