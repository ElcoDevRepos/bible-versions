In the ancient Near Eastern context, ashes often represented worthlessness and desolation. Feeding on ashes suggests a spiritual diet that lacks nourishment and substance, highlighting the emptiness of worshiping idols. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe the futility of idol worship, such as <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, where idols are depicted as lifeless and powerless.<p><b>His deluded heart has led him astray,</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. A deluded heart indicates a state of self-deception and moral confusion. This reflects the biblical theme of the heart's susceptibility to sin and deception, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful above all things. The phrase underscores the spiritual blindness that results from turning away from God.<p><b>and he cannot deliver himself</b><br>This highlights the inability of individuals to save themselves from the consequences of their idolatry and sin. It emphasizes the need for divine intervention and salvation, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The inability to deliver oneself is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation is portrayed as a gift from God through Jesus Christ, not something that can be achieved by human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>or say, &#8220;Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?&#8221;</b><br>The right hand is often associated with power and authority in biblical literature. Holding an idol in the right hand symbolizes reliance on something that is ultimately false and powerless. The inability to recognize the lie indicates a profound spiritual blindness. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of truth versus falsehood, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself to be the way, the truth, and the life, contrasting the truth of God with the lies of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Idolatry always promises nourishment yet leaves only emptiness. Scripture repeatedly affirms this pattern. <a href="/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a> speaks of eating &#8220;ashes like bread,&#8221; and <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a> says Ephraim &#8220;feeds on the wind.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a> asks why anyone would &#8220;spend money on what is not bread,&#8221; highlighting how false worship drains resources and strength without giving life. The literal record of Isaiah&#8217;s words therefore exposes the hollowness of trusting anything other than the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His deluded heart has led him astray</b><p>The outward act of idol-making begins with inward deception. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> declares the heart &#8220;deceitful above all things,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> warns that &#8220;there is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&#8221; <a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a> reminds us that evil thoughts originate from within. <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-25</a> traces the same downward spiral: imaginations become futile, and hearts grow dark when truth is exchanged for a lie. Isaiah states the fact plainly: the heart itself, corrupted by sin, steers a person away from the Lord&#8217;s revealed truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He cannot deliver himself</b><p>Once the heart is captive, self-rescue is impossible. <a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a> describes idol worshipers who &#8220;pray to a god that cannot save.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-8</a> testifies that no one &#8220;can redeem his brother&#8221; or even himself. <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-9</a> pictures humanity dead in trespasses, needing God&#8217;s gracious intervention. The verse in Isaiah insists that human effort, no matter how sincere, offers no escape from the bondage created by idolatry and sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or say, &#8220;Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?&#8221;</b><p>The &#8220;right hand&#8221; symbolizes strength and trust. Sadly, the idolater clutches deception so tightly that he is unable even to acknowledge it. <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18-19</a> mocks those who say to wood, &#8220;Awake!&#8221; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> describes idols with mouths that cannot speak and eyes that cannot see, adding that &#8220;those who make them will become like them.&#8221; First <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a> urges believers to keep themselves from idols entirely. Isaiah&#8217;s indictment reveals a willful blindness that refuses the simple confession, &#8220;This is false.&#8221; Without divine illumination, the lie feels safer than the truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a> exposes the tragic cycle of idolatry: it offers only ashes, springs from a deceived heart, leaves the sinner powerless to save himself, and blinds him to the lie he embraces. Scripture consistently confirms these realities and points to the only solution&#8212;turning to the Lord, the one true and living God, who alone satisfies, enlightens, and delivers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">He feedeth on ashes.</span>--The verb passes readily through the meanings "feeding," "pasturing," "following after," and the last is commonly accepted.

The "ashes" of the smith's furnace become the symbols of the vanity of his work (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm" title="For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>), and yet he has not even the germ of truth which lies in the questions of the sceptic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He feedeth on ashes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. on</span> vanity - on what can give no support or sustenance (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-14.htm">Proverbs 15:14</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A deceived heart</span>.

The deceived soul is bound in trammels, which it feels to be irksome, and from which it would fain be free. But it cannot deliver itself. Deliverance must come from some external source; in other words, man needs a Deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span> An idol is "a lie." It professes to have power, strength, ability to help and save, whereas it has no power at all. It cannot even save itself. Savages often beat their fetishes. Diagoras of Melos threw an image of Hercules into the fire on which he was cooking his dinner, and bade Hercules make himself of some use by boiling his turnips.
