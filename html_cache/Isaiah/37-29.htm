In the biblical context, Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and brutality. The arrogance of Sennacherib is highlighted in his dismissive attitude towards the God of Israel, as seen in his threats against Jerusalem. This echoes the biblical theme that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The phrase "have reached My ears" signifies that God is fully aware of the blasphemies and boasts of the Assyrian king, emphasizing His omniscience and the personal nature of His relationship with His people.<p><b>I will put My hook in your nose</b><br>This imagery is drawn from the Assyrian practice of leading captives with hooks through their noses, a method used to humiliate and control. It signifies God's intention to subdue and humiliate Sennacherib, turning his own methods against him. Historically, this reflects the brutal nature of Assyrian conquests and their treatment of captives, which was well-documented in ancient reliefs and inscriptions. Theologically, it demonstrates God's sovereignty over even the most powerful earthly rulers, asserting His control over the nations.<p><b>and My bit in your mouth</b><br>The bit in the mouth is a metaphor for control, similar to how a rider directs a horse. This phrase indicates that God will direct Sennacherib's actions, despite his intentions. It underscores the biblical principle that God can guide the hearts of kings (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). This also serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over human affairs, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled even through the actions of those who oppose Him.<p><b>I will send you back the way you came.</b><br>This prophecy foretells the retreat of the Assyrian army from Jerusalem without achieving their goal. Historically, this was fulfilled when Sennacherib's forces withdrew after a divine intervention, as recorded in <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>. This event is corroborated by Assyrian records, which conspicuously omit the capture of Jerusalem, suggesting an unexpected retreat. Theologically, this demonstrates God's protection of His covenant people and His ability to deliver them from seemingly insurmountable threats. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who provides salvation and victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
