This reflects the early Christian practice of addressing communities with familial terms, emphasizing the close-knit nature of the early church. The term "urge" indicates a strong appeal or exhortation, suggesting the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>not as a new commandment to you</b><br>This phrase highlights the continuity of the message with previous teachings. It echoes the words of Jesus in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>, where He gives the commandment to love one another. The emphasis here is on the timeless nature of this command, reinforcing that it is not a novel idea but a foundational principle of Christian faith.<p><b>but one we have had from the beginning</b><br>The "beginning" refers to the inception of the Christian faith and the teachings of Jesus Christ. This phrase underscores the consistency of the message of love throughout the history of the church. It connects to 1 <a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>, where the same idea is presented, emphasizing the enduring and unchanging nature of this commandment.<p><b>that we love one another</b><br>This command to love is central to Christian doctrine and is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>. It reflects the agape love, a selfless, sacrificial love that is a hallmark of Christian relationships.

In the very next verses John warns about deceivers, so genuine love must stay tethered to doctrinal truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John warmly but firmly reminds his readers of an old, ever-relevant command: love one another. This appeal carries apostolic authority, stands unchanged from the earliest revelation, and functions as the visible proof that believers live in the truth.
