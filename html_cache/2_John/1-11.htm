The greeting here is not merely a casual salutation but implies a form of endorsement or acceptance. In the early church, hospitality was a significant cultural practice, often involving the sharing of meals and resources. This phrase warns against extending such hospitality to false teachers, as it could be seen as supporting or legitimizing their message. The early Christian community was tightly knit, and any association with heretical teachings could lead to confusion and division within the church.<p><b>shares in his evil deeds</b><br>The concept of sharing in another's deeds is rooted in the biblical principle of accountability and association. By supporting or endorsing false teachers, one becomes complicit in their actions and teachings. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity and holiness, where believers are called to separate themselves from sin and falsehood. The idea of sharing in evil deeds is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, where Paul warns that "a little leaven leavens the whole lump," emphasizing the corrupting influence of sin and false teaching.

leaves no loopholes; every believer is accountable (cf. <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>- John&#8217;s warning applies to pastors, parents, and pew-sitters alike&#8212;no one is exempt (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p>- The context (<a href="/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) identifies the threat: &#8220;many deceivers have gone out into the world&#8230; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Greets</b><p>- In first-century culture, greeting often involved hospitality, lodging, and financial help (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>; <a href="/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a>).<p>- Extending this kind of welcome publicly endorses a visitor&#8217;s message (<a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>).<p>- John&#8217;s earlier counsel: &#8220;If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him&#8221; (<a href="/2_john/1-10.htm">2 John 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such a person</b><p>- The &#8220;person&#8221; is specifically a false teacher who &#8220;does not remain in the teaching of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_john/1-9.htm">2 John 1:9</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly distinguishes between the lost who need the gospel (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>) and those who actively subvert it (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8-9</a>).<p>- Paul names Hymenaeus and Alexander as examples to be avoided because of doctrinal shipwreck (<a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shares</b><p>- To &#8220;share&#8221; means to participate, partner, or fellowship&#8212;terms loaded with spiritual significance (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>).<p>- Even passive association lends credibility to error (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p>- We are called to &#8220;keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his evil deeds</b><p>- False teaching is labeled &#8220;evil&#8221; because it distorts the gospel and imperils souls (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>).<p>- By supporting or endorsing, one becomes complicit (<a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>).<p>- Light and darkness cannot mix without consequence (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s concise warning underscores that doctrinal purity is inseparable from practical fellowship. Offering hospitality or endorsement to a teacher who denies Christ&#8217;s doctrine makes us partners in that rebellion. Love for truth sometimes requires closed doors, so that the gospel remains untainted and God&#8217;s people stay protected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - To give countenance and sanction to false doctrine is to share in the responsibility for all the harm which such false doctrine does.
