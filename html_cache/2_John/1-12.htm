The use of "many things" suggests that there are numerous issues or teachings he wishes to address, reflecting the comprehensive nature of apostolic instruction. This mirrors other epistles where apostles express a desire to impart wisdom and guidance (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/11-34.htm">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>, <a href="/philippians/3.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>).<p><b>but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink</b><br>The preference for personal communication over written correspondence highlights the limitations of letters in conveying the full depth of emotion and nuance. In the ancient world, letters were a common form of communication, but face-to-face interaction was valued for its immediacy and personal connection. This reflects the relational nature of early Christian communities.<p><b>Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face</b><br>The desire for personal interaction underscores the importance of fellowship and direct communication in the early church. "Face to face" suggests a level of intimacy and personal engagement that written words cannot achieve. This phrase echoes the relational aspect of Jesus' ministry, where personal encounters were transformative (e.g., <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-26</a>, the Samaritan woman at the well).<p><b>so that our joy may be complete</b><br>The completion of joy through personal interaction suggests that fellowship and unity among believers are sources of profound joy. This reflects the biblical theme that true joy is found in community and shared faith (e.g., <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2, 1</a> <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>).

His heart is full of things to write, but he hopes soon to have unlimited conversation.<p><span class= "bld">Paper.</span>--The Egyptian <span class= "ital">papyrus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ink.</span>--A mixture of soot, water, and gum. The papyrus-tree grows in the swamps of the Nile to the height of ten feet and more. Paper was prepared from the thin coats that surround the plant. Pliny describes the method (xiii. 23). The different pieces were joined together by the turbid Nile water, as it has a kind of glutinous property. One layer of papyrus was laid flat on a board, and a cross layer put over it; these were pressed, and afterwards dried in the sun. The sheets were then fastened or pasted together. There were never more than twenty of these sheets fastened together in a roll; but of course the length could be increased to any extent. The writing was in columns, with a blank slip between them; it was only on one side. When the work was finished, it was rolled on a staff, and sometimes wrapped in a parchment case (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, </span>p. 567).<p>Of the ink used by the Romans, Pliny says that it was made of soot in various ways, with burnt resin or pitch. "For this purpose they have built furnaces which do not allow the smoke to escape. The kind most commended is made in this way from pine-wood: it is mixed with soot from the furnaces or baths; and this they use for writing on rolls. Some also make a kind of ink by boiling and straining the lees of wine." The black matter of the cuttle-fish was also sometimes used for writing (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span>, p. 110).<p>The pen was a reed, sharpened with a knife, and split like a quill-pen.<p>The Jews seem to have used lamp-black dissolved in gall-juice, or lamp-black and vitriol, for ink. The modern scribes "have an apparatus consisting of a metal or ebony tube for their reed-pens, with a cup or bulb of the same material attached to the upper end for ink. This they thrust through the girdle, and carry with them at all times" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 131; Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>p. 1802).<p><span class= "bld">Speak face to face.</span>--Not that there was any oral tradition which he would not write down.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE EPISTLE. It is in their openings and conclusions, and especially in the latter, that the Second and Third Epistles have so strong a resemblance that we are almost compelled to assign them not merely to the same author, but to the same period in the author's life. St. John had a tenacious memory, as his writings prove; but we may doubt whether so trivial a matter as the mode of beginning and ending a short letter would have remained for years together in his mind. We may reasonably conclude from their similarity that these two Epistles are separated from one another by only a short interval of time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having many things to write.</span> This remark is almost conclusive against the supposition that the Second Epistle was sent as a companion-letter to the First. The hypothesis has little or nothing to support it. I would not (do so) by means of paper and ink. It is astonishing that any one should suppose that intercourse on paper is here opposed to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> intercourse: obviously it is opposed to <span class="accented">conversation.</span> The elder just writes what is of urgent importance to prevent fatal mistakes during the present time, and leaves everything else until he can talk matters over with her. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is mentioned nowhere else in the New Testament, but is found in the Septuagint (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>); it probably means "papyrus." <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the parallel passage <a href="/3_john/1-13.htm">3 John 1:13</a>, and in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; it was commonly made of lampblack or other soot, and hence the name. <span class="cmt_word">But I hope to come unto you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I hope to come to be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">at your house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is here very much the same as the French <span class="accented">chez vous.</span> So also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/matthew/13-56.htm">Matthew 13:56</a> (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13</a>). "Face to face" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is exactly the French <span class="accented">bouche a bouche.</span> The phrase occurs only here and <a href="/3_john/1-14.htm">3 John 1:14</a> in the New Testament. In <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but there the emphatic thing is that the two should <span class="accented">see</span> one another. Here the special point is that they should <span class="accented">converse</span> with one another; and this is more clearly expressed by "month to mouth" than by "face to face." For the phrase, "that <span class="accented">your</span> joy may be fulfilled," see note on 1 John 1:4, to which passage the apostle may here be consciously referring. That was ever one main purpose of his teaching - the perfecting of Christian joy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_john/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
