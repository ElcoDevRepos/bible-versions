In the context of the early church, false teachings and deceptive doctrines were prevalent, threatening the integrity of the Christian faith. The call to "watch" is reminiscent of Jesus' own warnings to His disciples to be alert and discerning (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>). The Greek term used here implies a continuous, active vigilance, suggesting that believers must constantly guard against spiritual complacency and deception.<p><b>so that you do not lose what we have worked for</b><br>The apostle John emphasizes the collective effort and investment made in the spiritual growth and doctrinal purity of the church. The "work" refers to the apostolic teaching and the establishment of the church's foundation in truth. This echoes Paul's concern in <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>, where he fears that his labor might be in vain if the Galatians turn away from the gospel. The potential loss here is not just personal but communal, affecting the entire body of believers.<p><b>but that you may be fully rewarded</b><br>The concept of reward is a recurring theme in the New Testament, often linked to faithfulness and perseverance in the Christian life (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). The "full reward" suggests a complete and abundant recompense, possibly referring to eternal rewards in the presence of Christ. This phrase underscores the importance of steadfastness in faith and doctrine, as the ultimate reward is contingent upon remaining true to the teachings of Christ and the apostles. The idea of reward also connects to the parables of Jesus, where faithful servants are commended and rewarded by their master (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of this epistle, John was one of Jesus' closest disciples and a key leader in the early church.

Apostolic labor and congregational perseverance are intertwined.<p>&#8226; The apostles&#8217; labor&#8212;Paul feared his work might be &#8220;in vain&#8221; if believers drifted (<a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>). John voices the same concern.<p>&#8226; The believers&#8217; labor&#8212;each disciple&#8217;s obedience contributes to the church&#8217;s witness (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8-9</a>). When someone embraces error, that collective progress is set back.<p>&#8226; What can be lost? Not the gift of salvation itself (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>), but the fruitfulness, testimony, and reward attached to faithful service (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>).<p>In context, deceivers &#8220;who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) threatened the flock. Rejecting such error protects everything the church has built together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but that you may be fully rewarded</b><p>Scripture promises a future evaluation for believers: &#8220;We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ&#8230;to receive what is due&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). John wants his readers to receive the whole reward, not a diminished one.<p>&#8226; Reward is certain&#8212;Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Reward is proportionate&#8212;&#8220;If anyone&#8217;s work remains, he will receive a reward&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Reward is joyous&#8212;&#8220;Great is your reward in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>).<p>Abiding in sound doctrine and love safeguards the fullness of that reward. Compromise erodes it; perseverance enriches it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s brief exhortation urges believers to stay spiritually awake, guard the truth they have received, and cling to it together so that none of the fruit of their collective labor is forfeited. Vigilant hearts and steadfast doctrine keep the church on course for the richest reward Christ delights to give His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The authorities vary much as to the persons of the three verbs, "lose," "have wrought," "receive," some reading "we," and some "ye," in each case. The best reading seems to be, "That <span class="accented">ye</span> lose not the things which <span class="accented">we</span> have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, beware of allowing our work in you to be undone to your grievous loss. Through not seeing the meaning of the passage, some scribes changed" ye" into "we," and others changed" we" into "ye," thus making all three verbs in the same person. There is a similar case in <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, where the true reading seems to be, "We must work the works of him that sent me;" but in order to produce uniformity some scribes altered "we" into "I," while others turned "me" into "us." The next verse explains the nature of the "full reward" which the lady and some of her children are in danger of losing, - it is nothing less than God himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_john/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Watch</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(blepete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_991.htm">Strong's 991: </a> </span><span class="str2">(primarily physical), I look, see, perceive, discern.
