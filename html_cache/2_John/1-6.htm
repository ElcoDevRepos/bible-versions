In the New Testament, love is often described as selfless and sacrificial, reflecting the love of Christ for humanity. This phrase emphasizes that true love is demonstrated through obedience to God's will.<p><b>that we walk according to His commandments.</b><br>Walking according to His commandments implies a continuous, active lifestyle of obedience. The term "walk" is frequently used in Scripture to denote one's conduct or way of life (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The commandments refer to the teachings of Christ and the moral laws found in Scripture. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."<p><b>This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning,</b><br>The phrase "from the beginning" suggests a foundational teaching that has been consistent since the inception of the Christian faith. It echoes 1 <a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>, where the commandment to love one another is described as both old and new. This continuity underscores the unchanging nature of God's expectations for His people.<p><b>that you must walk in love.</b><br>Walking in love is a central theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of John and Paul. It involves living a life characterized by love for God and others, as seen in the Great Commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). This commandment to love is not optional but essential for believers, reflecting the love of Christ and serving as a witness to the world (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of this epistle, John was one of Jesus' closest disciples and is often referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."
