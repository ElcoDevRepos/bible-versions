This situation highlights the recurring theme of testing and reliance on God for provision. The lack of water is a physical manifestation of the spiritual challenges the Israelites faced. In the broader biblical narrative, water often symbolizes life and spiritual sustenance, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of the "living water." The absence of water here foreshadows the need for divine intervention and points to the Israelites' dependence on God.<p><b>so they gathered against Moses and Aaron</b><br>The congregation's gathering against Moses and Aaron reflects a pattern of rebellion and dissatisfaction that the Israelites frequently exhibited during their wilderness journey. This incident is reminiscent of previous complaints, such as in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>, where the people quarreled with Moses over water at Rephidim. The people's actions demonstrate a lack of faith and trust in God's appointed leaders, Moses and Aaron, who serve as mediators between God and the Israelites. This rebellion can be seen as a type of the rejection of Christ, the ultimate mediator, as described in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-19</a>, where the unbelief of the Israelites is compared to the rejection of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness. Moses is a central figure in this account, representing God's authority and leadership.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the first high priest of Israel. He assists Moses in leading the people and performing priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective body of the Israelites who are journeying through the wilderness.

Their very survival is on the line (<a href="/numbers/20-4.htm">Numbers 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God has already proven He can provide water&#8212;from Marah&#8217;s bitter pools (<a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22-25</a>) to Rephidim&#8217;s rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). The repetition underlines His faithfulness and Israel&#8217;s forgetfulness (<a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that even God-led journeys include genuine hardships. Obedience does not shield believers from trials (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting exposes the heart: deprivation surfaces distrust or faith. Israel&#8217;s response will soon reveal which dominates (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gathered against Moses and Aaron</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;so they gathered against Moses and Aaron.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The people turn corporate frustration toward God&#8217;s appointed leaders, repeating patterns seen at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>), over manna (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>), and during the Korah rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-41.htm">Numbers 16:41</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gathered against&#8221; is not a polite meeting; it signals confrontation&#8212;pressure that can tempt leaders to react in the flesh, as Moses sadly will (<a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By blaming mediators, the congregation indirectly accuses God (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Each complaint is, in essence, unbelief in His character (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership in God&#8217;s service often stands at the crossroads of divine provision and human anger. Moses and Aaron embody the weight of intercession (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and the vulnerability of fatigue (<a href="/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment foreshadows Christ, the greater Mediator, who would bear humanity&#8217;s grievances yet respond flawlessly (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2</a> records a real crisis&#8212;literal thirst&#8212;and an escalating conflict&#8212;accusation against God&#8217;s leaders. The verse teaches that life&#8217;s shortages unmask hearts, prompting either faith in the Lord who has provided before or resentment that questions His goodness. Israel&#8217;s gathering against Moses and Aaron warns believers to direct petitions to God, not hostility toward His servants, trusting that the One who once drew water from a rock still meets every need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And there was no water . . . --</span>Kadesh may have comprised a considerable portion of the wilderness of Zin, and there may have been a supply of water in some parts of the district and a scarcity in others; or the supply may have proved insufficient for the wants of so great a multitude; or the miraculous supply which was given at Rephidim may have continued, with more or less frequent intermissions, up to the time to which this statement refers, and may have been suddenly withdrawn at this time in order to try the faith of the Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There</span> <span class="cmt_word">was no water.</span> There was a large natural spring at Kadesh, and during the time of their previous sojourn there no complaint of this sort seems to have arisen.
