Balaam's reputation as a seer and his ability to bless or curse were recognized across the region. Pethor, identified with a location near the Euphrates River, suggests Balaam's influence extended far beyond local boundaries. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of consulting diviners for guidance and intervention in political and military matters.<p><b>which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people</b><br>The Euphrates River was a significant geographical landmark in the ancient world, often associated with fertility and prosperity. Balaam's origin from this region indicates a connection to Mesopotamian culture, known for its rich tradition of divination and astrology. This background provides insight into Balaam's practices and the expectations Balak had of him.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,&#8221; said Balak.</b><br>Balak refers to the Israelites, who had recently been delivered from slavery in Egypt. This historical context highlights the fear and anxiety among the neighboring nations as the Israelites approached the Promised Land. The miraculous exodus from Egypt was well-known, and Balak's statement underscores the perceived threat posed by the Israelites' presence.<p><b>&#8220;They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.&#8221;</b><br>Balak's description of the Israelites as covering the land emphasizes their large numbers and the potential impact on the region's resources and security. The phrase suggests a sense of urgency and desperation, as Balak seeks to protect his kingdom from what he perceives as an imminent threat. This situation sets the stage for the unfolding narrative, where divine intervention and the sovereignty of God over human affairs become central themes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites due to their numbers and past victories.

His father's name (<span class= "ital">Beor</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>from <span class= "ital">baar </span>(to consume), has been thought to denote that Balaam belonged to a family in which the magical art was hereditary. He is described in <a href="/joshua/13-22.htm" title="Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.">Joshua 13:22</a> as "the soothsayer" (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">kosem</span>)--i.e., one of that class of persons who were not to be tolerated amongst the Israelites, and who are spoken of as "an abomination unto the Lord" (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>).

Both names have probable reference to the supposed effect of their maledictions, for successful cursing was an hereditary profession in many. lands, as it still is in some. Beer appears in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> as Bosor, which is called a Chaldeeism, but the origin of the change is really unknown. A "Bela son of Beer" is named in <a href="/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a> as reigning in Edom, but the coincidence is of no importance: kings and magicians have always loved to give themselves names of fear, and their vocabulary was not extensive. <span class="cmt_word">To Pother, which</span> is by <span class="cmt_word">the river of the land of the children of his people.</span> Rather, "which is on the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the great river Euphrates, "in the land of the children of his people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his native land.

This would hardly have been said when Israel was encamped thirty miles north of Arnon, opposite to Jericho. The two embassies to Balaam must have occupied some time, and in the mean while Israel would have gone further on his way.
