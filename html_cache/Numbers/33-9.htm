It is known for its bitter waters, which the Israelites could not drink until God instructed Moses to throw a piece of wood into the water, making it sweet. This event symbolizes God's provision and the testing of faith. The journey from Marah signifies moving from a place of bitterness and testing to a place of rest and abundance.<p><b>and came to Elim</b><br>Elim is described as an oasis in the desert, providing a stark contrast to Marah. It represents a place of rest and refreshment for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The name "Elim" itself suggests a place of strong trees or mighty ones, indicating a fertile and hospitable environment. This stop is significant as it shows God's provision and care for His people, offering them respite in their journey.<p><b>where there were twelve springs</b><br>The twelve springs at Elim can be seen as symbolic of the twelve tribes of Israel, each having its source of sustenance and refreshment. This detail emphasizes God's provision for each tribe individually, ensuring that all His people are cared for. The number twelve often represents completeness and divine order in the Bible, reinforcing the idea of God's perfect provision.<p><b>and seventy palm trees</b><br>The seventy palm trees may symbolize the seventy elders of Israel mentioned in <a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a> and <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>. This number can also represent the nations of the world, as seen in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, which lists seventy nations descending from Noah. The presence of the palm trees suggests a place of shade and rest, further highlighting the abundance and comfort provided by God.<p><b>and they camped there</b><br>Camping at Elim indicates a temporary but significant pause in the Israelites' journey. It is a time for rest, reflection, and preparation for the next stage of their journey to the Promised Land. This period of rest can be seen as a type of the spiritual rest found in Christ, who offers refreshment and renewal to those who follow Him. The Israelites' stay at Elim serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of trusting in His provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/marah.htm">Marah</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites encountered bitter water, which God made sweet, symbolizing His provision and care.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elim.htm">Elim</a></b><br>A place of rest and abundance with twelve springs and seventy palm trees, representing God's provision and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land, experiencing God's guidance and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, guiding them through the wilderness under God's direction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The overarching theme of God's care and provision for His people during their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_the_wilderness.htm">God's Provision in the Wilderness</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness, He provides for us in our times of need.
