Balak, the king of Moab, was fearful of the Israelites' approach and sought Balaam, a renowned diviner, to curse them. This phrase highlights the tension between human plans and divine intervention. Balaam's journey was marked by divine encounters, including the famous incident with the talking donkey, which underscores God's control over the situation.<p><b>Balaam replied,</b><br>Balaam's response is crucial as it sets the tone for his interactions with Balak. Despite being a pagan prophet, Balaam acknowledges a higher authority. His reply indicates a shift from his initial intentions, influenced by God's direct intervention. This moment reflects the biblical theme of God using unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>.<p><b>but can I say just anything?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes Balaam's awareness of his limitations. It reflects the biblical principle that true prophecy is not subject to human will but is directed by God. This aligns with <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, which states that prophecy comes from God, not from human impulse. Balaam's acknowledgment serves as a reminder of the sovereignty of God over human speech and actions.<p><b>I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.</b><br>Balaam's declaration underscores the concept of divine inspiration. Despite his initial desire for personal gain, Balaam recognizes that he is bound to speak only what God commands. This mirrors the prophetic tradition seen throughout Scripture, where prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>) are given words directly from God. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's word through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. Balaam's statement highlights the tension between human free will and divine sovereignty, a recurring theme in biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless and curse.

His opening words underline a simple fact&#8212;he really is here. Yet the journey was anything but simple.<p>&#8226; The Angel of the LORD blocked Balaam three times, reminding him that divine permission, not human promise, moves a prophet (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Balaam had told Balak&#8217;s emissaries, &#8220;Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything beyond the command of the LORD my God&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>). His arrival, therefore, does not signal independence; it signals submission.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes of obedient arrival echo through Scripture: Abraham traveling to Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>), Moses returning to Egypt (<a href="/exodus/4-20.htm">Exodus 4:20</a>), Jonah finally entering Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>). Each journey testifies that true servants show up when God says go, yet remain bound to His word once they arrive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but can I say just anything?</b><p>Standing before a pagan king eager for a lucrative curse, Balaam immediately limits his own speech.<p>&#8226; Prophetic restraint runs like a thread through Scripture. Micaiah told King Ahab, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14</a>). Jeremiah warned against prophets who &#8220;speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s messengers are not free agents. Paul could have tailored his message for itching ears in Corinth, yet he declared, &#8220;We do not peddle the word of God for profit&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This caution guards both prophet and hearer. When Balaam asks, &#8220;Can I say just anything?&#8221; he admits that unchecked speech is dangerous (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1&#8211;2</a>). The question prepares Balak&#8212;and us&#8212;for a word that may contradict every human expectation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth</b><p>Here Balaam states the prophet&#8217;s creed.<p>&#8226; The phrase mirrors God&#8217;s promise to Moses: &#8220;I will help you speak and teach you what to say&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>) and His pledge concerning the coming Prophet: &#8220;I will put My words in his mouth&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; True prophecy is Spirit&#8208;given, not self&#8208;generated. &#8220;Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s fidelity will soon stun Balak. Instead of cursing, he blesses Israel repeatedly (<a href="/bsb/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23&#8211;24</a>), climaxing with a messianic oracle: &#8220;A Star will come forth from Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). God&#8217;s word overrides every contract, bribe, or threat.<p>&#8226; The New Testament carries the same mandate. When commanded to be silent, Peter and John replied, &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>). Whether prophet, apostle, or modern believer, the calling remains identical: echo heaven, add nothing, subtract nothing (<a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Balaam&#8217;s brief statement unfolds a threefold lesson: show up where God sends you, guard your tongue from self-willed speech, and release only what God places there. Prophets, pastors, parents, and every follower of Christ stand under the same banner: speak the word, all the word, and only the word of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;See,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1433;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
