Despite this, Reuben still held a significant position among the tribes. The camp of Reuben was positioned on the south side of the tabernacle during the Israelites' encampment in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>). This positioning reflects a structured and orderly movement, emphasizing God's command for order and discipline among His people. The setting out of the camp signifies obedience to God's instructions given through Moses, as the Israelites journeyed towards the Promised Land.<p><b>under their standard</b><br>Each tribe of Israel had its own standard or banner, which served as a rallying point and symbol of identity. The standard of Reuben is traditionally associated with the image of a man, reflecting Jacob's blessing that Reuben was his firstborn, "my might, the first sign of my strength" (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>). The use of standards was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures for military and organizational purposes, providing a sense of unity and belonging. This practice underscores the importance of identity and heritage within the community of God's people.<p><b>with Elizur son of Shedeur in command</b><br>Elizur, meaning "God is my rock," was the leader of the tribe of Reuben during the wilderness period. His father's name, Shedeur, means "field of light," which may reflect the divine guidance and illumination provided to the Israelites. Elizur's leadership role is consistent with the tribal structure established by God, where each tribe had a designated leader to represent them (<a href="/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5</a>). This hierarchical structure ensured that the tribes functioned cohesively and efficiently. The mention of Elizur highlights the importance of godly leadership and the responsibility of leaders to guide their people according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, Reuben is one of the twelve tribes of Israel.
