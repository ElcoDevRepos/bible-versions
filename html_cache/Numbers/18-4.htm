The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The Levites' role was crucial in maintaining the sanctity and order of the worship practices. This division of labor highlights the importance of community and shared responsibility in worship, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>, where different roles within the body of Christ are emphasized.<p><b>doing all the work at the Tent</b><br>The Levites were responsible for various tasks, including setting up, taking down, and transporting the Tabernacle, as well as assisting in the sacrifices and offerings. This work was not only physical but also spiritual, as it involved maintaining the holiness required for God's presence. The meticulous nature of their duties reflects the holiness and order that God demands, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, where God emphasizes His holiness among those who approach Him.<p><b>but no outsider may come near you</b><br>This restriction underscores the holiness of the priestly duties and the Tabernacle itself. An "outsider" refers to anyone not of the tribe of Levi, emphasizing the separation between the sacred and the common. This separation is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the need for purity and consecration when approaching God. It foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where believers are invited to draw near to God through the consecration provided by Jesus Christ, our High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe chosen by God to assist the priests in the service of the Tent of Meeting.
