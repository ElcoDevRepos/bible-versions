It served as the capital of Sihon, the Amorite king. The Amorites were a powerful group in the ancient Near East, often mentioned in the context of Israel's conquest of Canaan. The city of Heshbon is strategically important, situated on a plateau, which provided a military advantage. This location is confirmed by archaeological findings that suggest a well-fortified city. The Amorites, known for their warrior culture, were a formidable force, and Sihon was a prominent leader among them. The capture of Heshbon by the Israelites, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>, signifies a critical victory in their journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>who had fought against the former king of Moab</b><br>The reference to the former king of Moab indicates a historical conflict between the Amorites and the Moabites. Moab was a neighboring nation to the southeast of Israel, often in conflict with Israel and other surrounding nations. This phrase highlights the shifting power dynamics in the region, with Sihon expanding his territory at the expense of Moab. The Moabites, descendants of Lot, were related to the Israelites but frequently found themselves in opposition to them. This historical context sets the stage for understanding the complex relationships between these ancient peoples.<p><b>and taken all his land as far as the Arnon</b><br>The Arnon River served as a natural boundary between Moab and the Amorite territory. Sihon's conquest extended his domain to this significant geographical marker. The Arnon, a deep gorge, provided a natural defense line, making Sihon's victory over Moab a notable military achievement. This expansion of territory by Sihon underscores the Amorite king's strength and ambition. The mention of the Arnon also situates the narrative within a specific geographical context, helping readers understand the extent of the land involved in these ancient conflicts. This conquest by Sihon set the stage for Israel's subsequent battles and territorial claims as they journeyed toward the land promised to them by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in the territory of the Amorites, which became a focal point in the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The king of the Amorites, who conquered the land from the Moabites and later opposed the Israelites, leading to his defeat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in the land that the Israelites were to conquer as part of God's promise to Abraham.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with them, from whom Sihon had previously taken land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon.htm">Arnon</a></b><br>A river that served as a boundary marker, significant in the territorial disputes and conquests described in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_conquest.htm">God's Sovereignty in Conquest</a></b><br>The defeat of Sihon and the Amorites illustrates God's control over nations and His ability to fulfill His promises to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context_of_god's_promises.htm">Historical Context of God's Promises</a></b><br>Understanding the historical context of Israel's journey and conquests helps us appreciate the fulfillment of God's promises and His faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced physical battles, Christians today face spiritual battles.
