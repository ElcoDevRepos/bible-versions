The concept of "going astray" is often used in the Bible to describe unfaithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, where Israel is described as a wife who has gone astray from her husband, God. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, paralleling the marriage covenant.<p><b>while under your husband&#8217;s authority</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, the husband was considered the head of the household, and the wife was under his authority. This reflects the patriarchal structure of society at the time, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, where God tells Eve that her husband will rule over her. This authority was not only social but also legal, as the husband had certain rights and responsibilities over his wife.<p><b>and have defiled yourself</b><br>Defilement in this context refers to ritual and moral impurity. In <a href="/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>, adultery is explicitly mentioned as an act that defiles a person. The concept of defilement is significant in the Old Testament, as it often required purification rituals to restore a person to a state of cleanliness before God. This reflects the holiness code that governed Israelite life, emphasizing the need for purity in the community.<p><b>and lain carnally with a man other than your husband</b><br>This phrase specifies the act of adultery, which is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Adultery was not only a personal sin but also a social one, as it threatened the stability of the family unit and, by extension, the community. The act of lying carnally with another man is a direct violation of the marriage covenant, which is a type of the covenant between God and His people. In the New Testament, Jesus expands on the concept of adultery, teaching that even lustful thoughts are equivalent to the act itself (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>), thus emphasizing the importance of inner purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_woman.htm">The Israelite Woman</a></b><br>The passage refers to a woman suspected of adultery, highlighting the societal and religious expectations of marital fidelity in ancient Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband</a></b><br>He is the one who brings the suspicion of infidelity to the priest, reflecting the patriarchal structure of the society.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>Acts as a mediator in the ritual of the "water of bitterness," which is a test for the accused woman.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the ritual takes place, symbolizing God's presence and the seriousness of the covenantal laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ritual_of_the_bitter_water.htm">The Ritual of the Bitter Water</a></b><br>A ceremonial test to determine the guilt or innocence of the woman, reflecting the legal and spiritual practices of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant before God, and fidelity is a crucial aspect of this covenant.

The phrase underscores accountability inside marriage rather than outside it.<p>- God&#8217;s order in marriage is not about oppression but about faithful stewardship of vows (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>).<p>- This wording also highlights why adultery is doubly serious: it violates both God&#8217;s command and the partner&#8217;s God-given role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have defiled yourself</b><p>- &#8220;Defiled&#8221; signifies ceremonial and moral uncleanness (<a href="/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>- Sin doesn&#8217;t merely break a rule; it stains the person. David&#8217;s plea, &#8220;Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>), captures the same idea.<p>- The defilement also infects the community, so God provided a public process (<a href="/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12-14</a>) to protect Israel&#8217;s purity (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lain carnally with a man other than your husband</b><p>- The phrase nails down the physical act that seals the spiritual betrayal (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>).<p>- Scripture treats sexual intimacy as covenantal glue (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>). To share that bond outside marriage fractures the covenant triangle: God, husband, wife.<p>- The explicit wording prevents loopholes; any sexual union outside marriage is adultery, no matter the circumstances (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/5-20.htm">Numbers 5:20</a> confronts adultery head-on. God, who sees what is hidden, provided Israel with a ritual test to uncover unfaithfulness and preserve covenant purity. Each phrase underscores that straying from marital vows violates divine order, defiles the individual, and desecrates sacred union. The verse calls every generation to honor marriage, walking in truth before the God who lovingly watches over His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1431;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
