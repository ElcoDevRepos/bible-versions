The Tent of the Testimony, also known as the Tabernacle, was the sacred dwelling place of God among the Israelites. It housed the Ark of the Covenant and was the center of worship and divine communication. Moses, as the leader and prophet, had the authority to enter this holy place, signifying his role as mediator between God and the people.<p><b>and saw that Aaron&#8217;s staff, representing the house of Levi</b><br>Aaron's staff was a symbol of his authority and the divine selection of the tribe of Levi for priestly duties. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a staff often represented leadership and power. The house of Levi was chosen by God to serve in the Tabernacle, and Aaron's staff being used in this test underscores the legitimacy of his priesthood. This event was a direct response to the rebellion led by Korah, who questioned Aaron's exclusive right to the priesthood.<p><b>had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds</b><br>The miraculous transformation of Aaron's staff was a divine sign confirming his priestly authority. The progression from sprouting to producing almonds in a single night was a supernatural event, emphasizing God's power and approval. Almonds were significant in the ancient Near East, often symbolizing watchfulness and divine favor. This miracle prefigures the resurrection of Christ, as life emerged from what was essentially dead wood, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate High Priest. The almond tree, being the first to bloom in spring, also symbolizes new beginnings and God's faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the first high priest of Israel, representing the tribe of Levi.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_the_testimony.htm">The Tent of the Testimony</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, it was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_levi.htm">The House of Levi</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and service to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_staff.htm">Aaron&#8217;s Staff</a></b><br>A symbol of God&#8217;s chosen leadership and priesthood, which miraculously sprouted, budded, blossomed, and produced almonds as a sign of divine approval.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_selection_and_authority.htm">Divine Selection and Authority</a></b><br>God confirms His chosen leaders through miraculous signs, as seen with Aaron's staff.

The miraculous shooting forth of Aaron's dry rod may be regarded as a type of the mode of the Spirit's operation in the Church, and more especially in the work of the ministry; "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And yielded almonds.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">and brought almonds to maturity, </span>or <span class= "ital">yielded ripe almonds. </span>The word <span class= "ital">shaked </span>(almond-tree) is a cognate form of the verb <span class= "ital">shakad</span>--<span class= "ital">to keep watch. </span>The name is supposed to have been given to the almond-tree because it blossoms at a time when vegetation is lying in the sleep of winter. (See <a href="/context/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>; also, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 319.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was budded:</span> or "sprouted." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And yielded almonds.</span> Rather, "matured almonds." This particular rod had been cut from an almond tree, and it would seem probable that it had on it shoots and flowers and fruit at once, so that the various stages of its natural growth were all exemplified together. The almond has its Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, "awake," from the well-known fact of its being the first of all trees to awake from the winter sleep of nature, and to herald the vernal resurrection with its conspicuous show of snow-white blossoms, which even anticipate the leaves (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). Thus the "rod of an almond-tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>) was shown to the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>) as the evident symbol of the vigilant haste with which the purposes of God were to be developed and matured. It is possible that all the tribe princes had official "rods" of the almond-tree to denote their watchful alacrity in duty, and that these were the rods which they brought to Moses. In any case the flowering and fruiting of Aaron's rod, while it was an unquestionable miracle (for if not a miracle, it could only have been a disgraceful imposture), was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in the true sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a miracle which was also a parable. Aaron's rod could no more blossom and fruit by nature than any of the others, since it also had been severed from the living tree; and so in Aaron himself was no more power or goodness than in the rest of Israel. But as the rod germinated and matured its fruit by the power of God, supernaturally starting and accelerating the natural forces of vegetable life, even so in Aaron the grace of God was quick and fruitful to put forth, not the signs only and promise of spiritual gifts and energies, but the ripened fruits as well. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The next day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7717;o&#183;r&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
