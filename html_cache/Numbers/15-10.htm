A "hin" is an ancient Hebrew unit of liquid measure, approximately equivalent to 3.5 liters or about 6 pints, so half a hin would be about 1.75 liters or 3 pints. The drink offering, or "nesek" in Hebrew, was poured out beside the altar, signifying the dedication and surrender of the offerer to God. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, where Jacob pours out a drink offering. The use of wine in offerings foreshadows the New Testament, where wine becomes a symbol of Christ's blood in the Lord's Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>).<p><b>It is a food offering,</b><br>The term "food offering" refers to the broader category of sacrifices that were presented to God, which included grain, oil, and drink offerings. These offerings were not consumed by God in a literal sense but were symbolic acts of worship and devotion. The Hebrew word for "food offering" is "isheh," which can also mean "fire offering," indicating that these offerings were typically burned on the altar. This act of burning symbolized the transformation of the physical into the spiritual, as the offering ascended to God in the form of smoke.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, signifying God's acceptance of the offering. It is not the physical smell that pleases God but the heart and obedience of the worshiper. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is described as a "fragrant offering and sacrifice to God." The pleasing aroma represents the idea that God delights in the sincere worship and devotion of His people. This phrase underscores the importance of the heart's attitude in worship, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including those in <a href="/bsb/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who established the covenant and gave the laws to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination of the Israelites, where they were to observe these laws as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place of worship where offerings were made, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Obedience in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for offerings highlight the importance of obedience in worship.
