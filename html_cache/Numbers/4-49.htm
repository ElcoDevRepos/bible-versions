Moses, as the mediator between God and the people, conveys God's commands, highlighting the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God speaking through chosen prophets and leaders, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise up a prophet like Moses.<p><b>they were numbered</b><br>The act of numbering, or taking a census, was significant for organizing the Levites for their service in the Tabernacle. This census was not merely for administrative purposes but was a divine directive to ensure that each Levite was prepared for their specific role. This mirrors the earlier census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, which organized the tribes for military purposes, showing the importance of order and structure in God's plans.<p><b>and each one was assigned his work and burden</b><br>This phrase indicates the specific roles and responsibilities given to each Levite. The Levites were divided into families, each with distinct duties related to the Tabernacle's care and transport. This division of labor ensured that the sacred tasks were performed efficiently and reverently. It also reflects the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a> about the body of Christ, where each member has a unique role to play.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>Reiterating the divine origin of these instructions underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch, where blessings are contingent upon following God's laws. It also foreshadows the ultimate obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly, as noted in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands and directs the numbering and organization of the Levites for their service in the tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His commands and organize the people according to divine instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for the service of the tabernacle, responsible for its care and transportation during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among His people, central to Israelite worship and community life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of Israel's history when they traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, during which the tabernacle was their spiritual center.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_divine_command.htm">Obedience to Divine Command</a></b><br>The Levites' service was not arbitrary but was directed by God's specific command.
