The mention of Hanniel highlights the importance of leadership within the tribes of Israel. Ephod, his father, is not widely mentioned elsewhere, indicating that Hanniel's role is more significant in this context. The name Ephod may remind readers of the priestly garment, suggesting a possible connection to spiritual leadership or service. This phrase emphasizes the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society, where family ties often determined one's role and responsibilities.<p><b>a leader from the tribe of Manasseh</b><br>Manasseh was one of the two sons of Joseph, and his tribe was one of the largest in Israel. The tribe of Manasseh was unique in that it was divided, with half settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other half on the west. This division is significant in understanding the geographical and political landscape of ancient Israel. Leaders from Manasseh, like Hanniel, played crucial roles in maintaining unity and order among the people. The tribe's connection to Joseph, a key figure in the history of Israel, underscores the continuity of God's promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>son of Joseph</b><br>Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, is a central figure in the narrative of Genesis. His life story, marked by betrayal, suffering, and eventual rise to power in Egypt, is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness. The mention of Joseph here serves as a reminder of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the fulfillment of His promises through their descendants. Joseph's legacy is one of redemption and reconciliation, themes that resonate throughout the biblical narrative and find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often seen as a type of Joseph in His role as a savior and reconciler.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph.
