This highlights God's concern for justice and fairness within the Israelite community. The daughters had previously approached Moses to claim their inheritance rights, as their father had no sons (<a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). This command underscores the importance of maintaining tribal inheritance and the continuity of family lineage, which was crucial in Israelite society. It also reflects God's willingness to address and adapt to unique circumstances within His covenant community.<p><b>They may marry anyone they please,</b><br>This phrase indicates a level of autonomy and choice given to the daughters, which was significant in a patriarchal society. It shows a balance between individual freedom and communal responsibility. The allowance for them to choose their husbands suggests a respect for personal agency, which is consistent with the biblical theme of free will. This freedom, however, is not without boundaries, as seen in the subsequent condition.<p><b>provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father.</b><br>The stipulation to marry within their father's clan ensures that the inheritance remains within the tribe of Manasseh. This was crucial for maintaining the tribal boundaries and inheritance laws established by God (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7-9</a>). It reflects the broader biblical principle of preserving the integrity and identity of the Israelite tribes. This requirement also points to the importance of community and family ties in ancient Israel. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of the Church, where believers are called to maintain unity and purity within the body of Christ. This command also prefigures the New Testament teaching on being "equally yoked" with fellow believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">The Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These were five sisters&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;who approached Moses to claim their inheritance rights after their father died without a male heir.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Manasseh, who died without sons, prompting a legal question about inheritance rights for his daughters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who brought their case before the LORD and received the commandment regarding their marriage and inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who provided the commandment to Moses regarding the daughters' right to marry within their father's tribe to preserve tribal inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, specifically involved in this inheritance issue, as the daughters were required to marry within this tribe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_fairness.htm">God's Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>God&#8217;s commandment regarding the daughters of Zelophehad demonstrates His concern for justice and fairness, ensuring that inheritance rights are preserved even when cultural norms are challenged.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_of_tribal_identity.htm">Preservation of Tribal Identity</a></b><br>The requirement for the daughters to marry within their father's tribe highlights the importance of maintaining tribal identity and heritage, which was crucial for the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The daughters' willingness to follow God's command serves as an example of obedience and trust in God's provision and wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Women in God's Plan</a></b><br>This passage underscores the significant role women can play in God's plan, as the daughters' actions led to a change in inheritance laws for future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_freedom_and_responsibility.htm">Balancing Freedom and Responsibility</a></b><br>While the daughters were given the freedom to choose their husbands, they were also given the responsibility to marry within their tribe, illustrating the balance between personal freedom and communal responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_36_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 36:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_36_6_on_marriage_obedience.htm">How does Numbers 36:6 emphasize obedience to God's commands in marriage choices?

Because it is a command from the LORD, it carries the same weight as the rest of revealed Scripture (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>).<p>- This framing reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s commands are not suggestions; they are gracious boundaries meant for blessing and order (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>concerning the daughters of Zelophehad</b><p>- These women&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;had already shown faith by seeking an inheritance when their father died without sons (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-7</a>).<p>- God affirmed their request, showing His care for justice and for those who might otherwise be overlooked (<a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3-4</a>).<p>- Mentioning them again highlights God&#8217;s ongoing provision: He does not grant a blessing and then ignore its practical outworking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They may marry anyone they please</b><p>- Personal choice is affirmed. Within God&#8217;s covenant people, marriage is not forced but entered freely (<a href="/genesis/24-57.htm">Genesis 24:57-58</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores dignity and agency for these women, demonstrating that God&#8217;s law protects freedom while guiding it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father</b><p>- The stipulation guards the land inheritance so it stays within the original tribal allotment (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7-9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-46.htm">Leviticus 25:46</a>).<p>- By tying marriage to tribal boundaries, God preserves the prophetic map of Israel, which foreshadows His ordered plan for redemption (<a href="/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>).<p>- Practical application: God often pairs freedom with guardrails. He invites us to choose wisely so blessings endure for future generations (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6</a> balances liberty and responsibility. God affirms the daughters&#8217; freedom to marry, yet He sets a boundary to protect the inheritance He graciously granted. The verse teaches that divine commands are loving safeguards, ensuring that individual decisions harmonize with God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the family of the tribe of their father shall they</span> marry. The direction is not altogether plain, since the <span class="accented">tribe</span> (<span class="accented">matteh</span>) contained several families (<span class="accented">mishpachoth</span>), and in this case one or more of the families were widely separated from the rest. Probably the words are to be read, "only to the tribe-family of their father," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, only into that <span class="accented">mishpachah</span> of Manasseh to which their father had belonged. Practically, therefore, they were restricted to the family of the Hepherites (<a href="/numbers/26-32.htm">Numbers 26:32, 33</a>). This is made almost certain when we remember that the territory of the "family" was to be apportioned within the tribe in the same way, and with the same regard to relationship, as the territory of the tribe within the nation (see on Numbers 33:54). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/36-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">concerning the daughters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
