It suggests a sense of urgency and anticipation in Balak's actions. The timing reflects the cultural practice of beginning significant activities early in the day, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>Balak took Balaam</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, is actively involved in guiding Balaam, a prophet known for his ability to bless or curse. This highlights Balak's desperation to secure a curse against Israel, reflecting the fear and anxiety of the Moabites towards the Israelites. The relationship between Balak and Balaam is one of political maneuvering, with Balak seeking to manipulate spiritual forces for his advantage.<p><b>and brought him up to Bamoth-baal</b><br>Bamoth-baal, meaning "high places of Baal," was a location dedicated to the worship of Baal, a prominent Canaanite deity. This site was likely chosen for its elevation, providing a strategic vantage point. The use of high places for worship was common in ancient cultures, as they were believed to be closer to the gods. This setting underscores the spiritual conflict between the God of Israel and the pagan deities.<p><b>From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people</b><br>The vantage point allowed Balaam to view the encampment of the Israelites, emphasizing the vastness and organization of the people. This sight would have been intimidating to Balak and his people, reinforcing their fear. The Israelites' encampment was a visible sign of God's promise and presence with His people, reminiscent of the promise to Abraham about his descendants being numerous. This scene sets the stage for the unfolding narrative where God's sovereignty and protection over Israel are demonstrated, despite Balak's intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner summoned by Balak to curse the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bamoth-baal.htm">Bamoth-baal</a></b><br>A high place dedicated to the Canaanite god Baal, used by Balak to show Balaam the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, camped in the plains of Moab, whom Balak fears due to their numbers and past victories.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Jordan River, where the events unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, God is in control and can turn curses into blessings.

Here, the new day brings Balak&#8217;s final attempt to manipulate circumstances before Balaam speaks; yet the reader knows the Lord has already spoken in verse 20.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal</b><p>&#8220;Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal&#8221;

<a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam, though professing to speak only what God allows (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>), still consents to stand on idolatrous ground&#8212;showing the compromise that later leads to Israel&#8217;s stumbling (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>;

Every detail underscores human schemes to reverse God&#8217;s blessing&#8212;yet the setting only magnifies the Lord&#8217;s coming proclamation of favor. The verse reminds believers that no height of earthly power, superstition, or calculated viewpoint can overturn what God has declared over His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Into the high places of Baal.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">to Bamoth-Baal. </span>Bamoth-Baal was probably the first height on the way to the steppes of Moab from which the Israelitish camp could be seen.

This verse, however, is more commonly interpreted as denoting that Balaam saw only the extremity of the camp. So the Targum of Palestine: "He saw from thence the camp of Dan, which went at the rear of the people." (See Note on <a href="/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Chapter 22:41.</span> - The high places of Baal, or "Bamoth-Baal." Perhaps the Bamoth mentioned in <a href="/numbers/21-19.htm">Numbers 21:19, 20</a>. This is, however, by no means certain, because high places were no doubt numerous, and that Bamoth would seem to have been too far from the present camp of Israel. In any case they crossed the Arnon, and ran some risk by adventuring themselves on hostile territory. <span class="cmt_word">That thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</span> According to the quasi-sacramental character attributed to the cursing of a seer, it was held necessary that the subject of the curse should be in view. Balak desired to attain this object with as little risk as possible, and therefore he took Balaam first of all to these heights, whence a distant and partial view of Israel might be had. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The next morning,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
