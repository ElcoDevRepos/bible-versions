Aaron, his brother, served as the high priest, a role that involved mediating between God and the Israelites. This relationship highlights the importance of obedience and the chain of command established by God.<p><b>Take your censer</b><br>A censer was a vessel used to burn incense, a common practice in ancient religious rituals. In the tabernacle, incense symbolized the prayers of the people rising to God. The censer here represents a tool for intercession, emphasizing the priestly role of mediating between God and humanity.<p><b>Place fire from the altar in it</b><br>The altar fire was considered holy, as it was initially kindled by God Himself (<a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>). Using fire from the altar signifies the need for divine purity and sanctification in the act of atonement. This act underscores the necessity of approaching God with reverence and according to His instructions.<p><b>And add incense</b><br>Incense, often associated with prayer and worship, was a key element in the tabernacle service. It symbolizes the intercessory prayers of the priest on behalf of the people. The addition of incense signifies the need for a pleasing aroma to God, representing the sincere prayers and repentance of the people.<p><b>Go quickly to the congregation</b><br>The urgency in Moses' command reflects the immediate danger facing the Israelites. The congregation, or assembly, refers to the entire community of Israel. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of sin and the need for collective atonement.<p><b>And make atonement for them</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through a sacrificial act. In the Old Testament, atonement was achieved through rituals prescribed by God, pointing to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ. This act by Aaron prefigures Christ's role as the ultimate high priest who makes atonement for humanity's sins.<p><b>Because wrath has come out from the LORD</b><br>The wrath of God in the Old Testament often manifested as a response to sin and rebellion. It serves as a reminder of God's holiness and justice. This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for divine intervention to avert disaster.<p><b>The plague has begun</b><br>Plagues were a common form of divine judgment in the Bible, often used to bring about repentance or demonstrate God's power. The beginning of the plague signifies the immediate consequences of disobedience and the urgent need for atonement to stop its spread. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance from sin and death through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
