The tabernacle, also known as the Tent of the Testimony, was a portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The term "Tent of the Testimony" refers to the tablets of the covenant law, which were housed within the Ark of the Covenant inside the tabernacle. This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>, where the tabernacle is set up on the first day of the first month in the second year after the Israelites left Egypt. The tabernacle's establishment signifies God's presence and guidance, a central theme throughout the Israelites' journey.<p><b>the cloud covered it</b><br>The cloud represents the visible manifestation of God's presence, often referred to as the Shekinah glory. This cloud had previously guided the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, where it provided direction and protection. The cloud covering the tabernacle indicates God's approval and His dwelling among His people. It served as a constant reminder of His guidance and faithfulness, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning</b><br>The appearance of fire within the cloud from evening until morning symbolizes God's protection and presence during the night. This dual manifestation of cloud by day and fire by night is a recurring theme, emphasizing God's unchanging presence and guidance. The fire also serves as a type of Christ, who is described as the light of the world in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>. Just as the fire provided light and safety for the Israelites, Christ provides spiritual illumination and protection for believers. This imagery also connects to the pillar of fire that led the Israelites, highlighting God's continuous provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, also known as the Tent of the Testimony.

Everything after that was but preparatory to the approaching departure, and therefore is narrated not in any order of time, but either as it referred back to the first day of the first month, or forward to the twentieth day of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">The cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony.</span> The testimony was the decalogue written on the two tables of stone, and enshrined within the ark, the moral law which lay at the heart of Judaism. The tent of the testimony was the holy of holies in which the ark dwelt (see on Numbers 10:11; 18:2). The exact meaning of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;</span> is disputed, or the rather significance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> with which the phrase "tent of the testimony" is appended to the word "tabernacle" (dwelling). Some take it as equivalent in construction to the genitive, "the dwelling of the tent of the testimony;" in which case it would simply mean that the cloud covered the whole tabernacle, the <span class="accented">mishcan</span> which enveloped and enclosed the <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which again enshrined the ark and the testimony. Others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> here in the sense of "at" or "towards," and read, "covered the dwelling, towards the tent of the testimony," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, over that part of it in which the testimony was kept. Apart from the strict grammatical question, the comparison of other passages cited (especially <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>) seems in favour of the first interpretation, and so apparently the Septuagint and the Targums. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the day that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
