In the context of <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, the registration or census was commanded by God to organize the Israelites for their journey and eventual conquest of Canaan. Zebulun's territory, as later described in <a href="/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10-16</a>, was located in the northern part of Israel, which included fertile lands and access to trade routes. This tribe played a significant role in Israel's history, contributing warriors to battles, as seen in <a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6 and 5</a>:18, where they supported Deborah and Barak against Sisera. The tribe's location and involvement in trade may have influenced their economic prosperity and military capabilities.<p><b>numbered 57,400</b><br>The census recorded 57,400 men from the tribe of Zebulun who were able to go to war, indicating a substantial population and military strength. This number reflects the tribe's growth and God's blessing upon them, fulfilling the promise of numerous descendants to the patriarchs. The census was not merely a logistical exercise but a demonstration of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. The specific number also highlights the importance of order and organization within the Israelite community as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The large number of fighting men from Zebulun underscores their potential contribution to the conquest of Canaan and their role in the collective identity and mission of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_zebulun.htm">Tribe of Zebulun</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Zebulun, the sixth son of Jacob and Leah.
