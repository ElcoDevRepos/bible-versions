This refusal highlights the deep-seated animosity between the two nations, rooted in the sibling rivalry of Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The Edomites' denial of passage is significant as it forced Israel to take a longer, more arduous route to the Promised Land. This act of refusal is a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah about the struggle between her sons' descendants (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Geographically, Edom was located south of the Dead Sea, and its terrain was rugged and mountainous, making it a strategic location that Israel hoped to traverse. Historically, this incident reflects the political tensions and territorial disputes common in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and Israel turned away from them</b><br>Israel's decision to turn away rather than engage in conflict demonstrates a commitment to peace and obedience to God's command to avoid hostility with Edom (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>). This action can be seen as a test of faith and patience for the Israelites, who were learning to trust in God's timing and provision. Theologically, this turning away can be viewed as a type of Christ, who also chose the path of peace and submission to God's will, even in the face of opposition. This moment foreshadows the New Testament teaching of loving one's enemies and seeking peace (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). The Israelites' detour around Edom is a reminder of the challenges and detours believers may face in their spiritual journey, emphasizing reliance on God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.
