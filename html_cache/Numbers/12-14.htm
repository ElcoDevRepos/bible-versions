In the context of <a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a>, God is addressing a situation involving Miriam and Aaron's challenge to Moses' authority. This divine response underscores the seriousness of the situation and God's defense of His chosen leader.<p><b>If her father had but spit in her face</b><br>Spitting in someone's face was a cultural expression of severe disgrace and rejection in ancient Near Eastern societies. This act symbolized shame and dishonor, often used in familial or community contexts to express disapproval. The reference to a father suggests a familial authority and the gravity of Miriam's offense against Moses, who was not only her brother but also God's appointed leader.<p><b>would she not have been in disgrace for seven days?</b><br>The seven-day period reflects a common biblical theme of completeness and purification. In Levitical law, seven days often marked the duration for purification rituals (<a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2, 14</a>:8). This period of disgrace serves as a temporary but significant consequence for Miriam's actions, emphasizing the need for repentance and restoration.<p><b>Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days</b><br>Being sent outside the camp was a form of social and religious exclusion, often used for those who were ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). This confinement underscores the seriousness of Miriam's sin and the need for purification before rejoining the community. It also reflects the holiness of the camp, where God's presence dwelt, and the necessity of maintaining purity within it.<p><b>after that she may be brought back in</b><br>This phrase indicates the possibility of restoration and forgiveness after a period of discipline. It highlights God's mercy and the opportunity for reconciliation after repentance. The reintegration into the community signifies the end of disgrace and the restoration of relationships, both with God and with the people. This concept of restoration is echoed in the New Testament, where repentance leads to forgiveness and reconciliation with God (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/miriam.htm">Miriam</a></b><br>The sister of Moses and Aaron, who, along with Aaron, spoke against Moses, questioning his unique relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and Miriam, who also participated in speaking against Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who defends Moses and punishes Miriam for her rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_israel.htm">The Camp of Israel</a></b><br>The community of Israelites journeying through the wilderness, representing the people of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rebellion.htm">The Seriousness of Rebellion</a></b><br>Miriam's punishment underscores the gravity of speaking against God's appointed leaders.

The Targums have, "if her father had corrected her." Probably they used this euphemism from a sense of a certain want of dignity and propriety in the original expression, considered as coming from the mouth of God. The act in question was, however, not uncommon in itself, and in significance clearly marked (see <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>). It was the distinctive note of public disgrace inflicted by one who had a right to inflict it. In the <span class="accented">case</span> of a father, it meant that he was thoroughly ashamed of his child, and judged it best (which would be only in extreme cases) to put his child to shame before all the world. So public a disgrace would certainly be felt in patriarchal times as a most severe calamity, and entailed by ordinary custom (as we learn here) retirement and mourning for seven days at least. How much more, when her heavenly Father had been driven to inflict a public disgrace upon her for perverse behavior, should the shame and the sorrow not be lightly put away,, but patiently endured for a decent period! (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/12-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
