The silver platter, a significant and valuable item, symbolizes the wealth and dedication of the tribe. The weight of a hundred and thirty shekels indicates a substantial offering, reflecting the importance of the occasion. The use of silver, a precious metal, underscores the value placed on worship and dedication to God. This act of giving can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate offering of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for humanity.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, is a symbol of wealth and devotion. Weighing seventy shekels, it complements the platter, together forming a complete offering. The use of silver in both items highlights the purity and worthiness required in offerings to God. This can be connected to the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard unit of weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring uniformity and fairness in offerings.

Fine flour signifies purity and quality, while oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit in Scripture. This offering is a reminder of God's provision and the need for gratitude and dedication in response. It also prefigures the bread of life, Jesus Christ, who sustains believers spiritually.

Together they invite God&#8217;s people&#8212;then and now&#8212;to approach Him through the finished work of His Son and to lay before Him worship that is pure, generous, and joyfully aligned with His eternal standard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-73.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;b&#257;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
