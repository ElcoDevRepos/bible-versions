In the context of Numbers, Balaam is a non-Israelite prophet who receives messages from God, highlighting that God's communication is not limited to Israel alone. This echoes the broader biblical theme that God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. The act of hearing God's words is central to the prophetic role, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise a prophet like Moses who will speak His words.<p><b>who sees a vision from the Almighty</b><br>Visions are a common means of divine communication in the Bible, often providing insight into God's plans and purposes. The term "Almighty" (Hebrew: Shaddai) underscores God's supreme power and authority. Balaam's vision is significant because it comes from the Almighty, lending it weight and authority. This aligns with other biblical visions, such as those of Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1), where the prophets receive profound revelations of God's glory and plans.<p><b>who bows down with eyes wide open</b><br>Bowing down signifies reverence and submission to God, a common response to divine encounters. The phrase "eyes wide open" suggests a state of spiritual awareness and readiness to receive God's message. This posture of humility and openness is essential for true prophetic insight, as seen in the experiences of other prophets like Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). It reflects the biblical principle that God reveals His secrets to those who are humble and reverent before Him (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel.

Balaam&#8212;though a Gentile seer hired to curse Israel&#8212;announces that the words he is about to speak are God&#8217;s own words.<p>&#8226; This underscores accountability; genuine prophecy cannot contradict prior revelation (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, faithful servants are marked by an attentive ear: &#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah paints the same picture of an obedient listener: &#8220;He awakens Me morning by morning; He awakens My ear to listen like those being taught&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4</a>).<p>By stressing that he &#8220;hears,&#8221; Balaam testifies that God can make His truth known even through unlikely instruments&#8212;and that the hearer must faithfully relay, not reshape, the message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sees a vision from the Almighty</b><p>Hearing is coupled with seeing; revelation engages both senses. Balaam isn&#8217;t working up fantasies but receiving a divinely granted glimpse.<p>&#8226; God spoke to Abram &#8220;in a vision&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>), and to Ezekiel when &#8220;the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;Almighty&#8221; (El Shaddai) stresses God&#8217;s sovereign power to reveal future realities no human could foresee.<p>&#8226; In Balaam&#8217;s case, the vision includes Israel&#8217;s blessed destiny and the future &#8220;star out of Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), forecasting Messiah&#8217;s reign.<p>True vision anchors faith in what God shows rather than what circumstances suggest; Moab wants a curse, but God reveals blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who bows down with eyes wide open</b><p>Revelation does not breed pride; it produces worship. Balaam &#8220;bows down,&#8221; acknowledging the One who has interrupted his plans. Yet his &#8220;eyes [are] wide open&#8221;&#8212;he remains conscious, absorbing what God displays.<p>&#8226; Moses reacted similarly: &#8220;Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>).<p>&#8226; John fell at Jesus&#8217; feet &#8220;as though dead&#8221; when given Revelation&#8217;s visions (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>This posture blends humility and alertness&#8212;heart low, eyes lifted. It models how believers receive God&#8217;s Word today: surrendering self while staying spiritually awake to see His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a> presents a three-fold portrait of authentic prophecy: a servant who hears God&#8217;s words, sees God&#8217;s vision, and responds in humble, wide-eyed worship. In context, Balaam&#8217;s reluctant obedience proves that God&#8217;s blessing on Israel is unstoppable. For us, the verse invites the same pattern&#8212;listen carefully to Scripture, look expectantly for God&#8217;s perspective, and bow willingly in reverent awe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">falling </span>(<span class= "ital">upon his face</span>)<span class= "ital">, and having his eyes opened. </span>The physical effect produced upon Balaam appears to have been the same as that which was produced upon Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 19:24</a>), upon Ezekiel (Num. i 28), upon Daniel (Num. viii, 17. 18). and upon St. John (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

There may be a reference to the events which befel Balaam on his journey (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm" title="Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.">Numbers 22:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Falling into a trance.</span> Rather, "falling down." <span class="accented">Qui cadit</span>, Vulgate. The case of Saul, who "fell down naked all that day" (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), overcome by the illapse of the Spirit, affords the best comparison. Physically, it would seem to have been a kind of catalepsy, in which the senses were closed to outward things, and the eyes open but unseeing. The word for "open" in this verse is the ordinary one, not that used in verse 3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the prophecy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of one who hears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_561.htm">Strong's 561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something said</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sees</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1457;&#1494;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ye&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2372.htm">Strong's 2372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze at, to perceive, contemplate, to have a, vision of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4236.htm">Strong's 4236: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vision</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the Almighty,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ad&#183;day)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7706.htm">Strong's 7706: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who bows down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;p&#772;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wide open:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;lui)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
