The directive to "take possession" implies an active role in claiming what God has promised. This reflects the covenantal promise made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where God promised his descendants a specific land. The act of taking possession also signifies a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled existence, which would require faith and obedience to God's commands. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the believer's journey to claim the spiritual inheritance promised in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>and settle in it</b><br>The instruction to "settle" indicates a long-term occupation and establishment of a community. This involves building homes, cultivating the land, and establishing societal structures according to God's laws. Historically, this was a significant shift for the Israelites, who had been wandering in the desert for 40 years. Culturally, settling in the land would require the Israelites to remain distinct from the surrounding nations, adhering to the laws given at Sinai. This settling is a precursor to the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel under leaders like David and Solomon.<p><b>for I have given you the land</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promise. The land is a divine gift, not earned by the Israelites' merit but granted by God's grace. This reflects the unconditional nature of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Theologically, it underscores the concept of divine providence and the assurance that God will fulfill His promises. This can be paralleled with the New Testament promise of eternal life, which is also a gift from God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>to possess</b><br>The term "possess" implies stewardship and responsibility. The Israelites are not merely to inhabit the land but to govern it according to God's laws. This involves driving out the current inhabitants, as commanded in earlier passages, to prevent idolatry and moral corruption. The possession of the land is both a privilege and a responsibility, requiring adherence to God's commandments. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of the believer's call to live a life set apart, possessing the promises of God through faith and obedience (<a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were led by Moses out of Egypt and through the wilderness toward the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants as an everlasting possession.

God tells Israel to march in, drive out the inhabitants, and make the land their home, because He has already deeded it to them. The verse spotlights God&#8217;s faithfulness, Israel&#8217;s required obedience, and the harmony between divine gift and human response&#8212;a timeless pattern calling every believer to actively claim and faithfully live within all that God has graciously provided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have given you the land.</span> "The earth is the Lord's," and no one, therefore, can dispute his right in the abstract to evict any of his tenants and to put others in possession. But while the whole earth was the Lord's, it is clear that he assumed a special relation towards the land of Canaan, as to which he chose to exercise directly the rights and duties of landlord (see on Deuteronomy 22:8 for a small but striking instance). The first duty of a landlord is to see that the occupancy of his property is not abused for illegal or immoral ends; and this duty excuses, because it necessitates, eviction under certain circumstances. It is not, therefore, necessary to argue that the Canaanites were more infamous than many others; it is enough to remember that God had assumed towards the land which they occupied (apparently by conquest) a relation which did not allow him to overlook their enormities, as he might those of other nations (see on Exodus 23:23-33; 34:11-17, and cf. <a href="/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). It was (if we like to put it so) the misfortune of the Canaanites that they alone of "all nations" could not be suffered to "walk in their own ways," because they had settled in a land which the Lord had chosen to administer directly as his own earthly kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to take possession of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#353;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
