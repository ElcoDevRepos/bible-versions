His anger here reflects a righteous indignation, similar to when he broke the tablets of the Law (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) upon seeing the Israelites worship the golden calf. This anger is not personal but is rooted in a zeal for God's holiness and commands. The officers of the army were responsible for executing God's judgment, and Moses' anger suggests a failure in their obedience to divine instructions.<p><b>the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds&#8212;</b><br>The structure of the Israelite military was organized with a clear hierarchy, as seen in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-25</a>, where Jethro advises Moses to appoint leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. This organization ensured order and accountability. The mention of commanders of thousands and hundreds indicates a significant military operation, reflecting the scale of the campaign against Midian. It also underscores the responsibility these leaders had in ensuring the army's actions aligned with God's commands.<p><b>who were returning from the battle.</b><br>The context of this battle is the war against the Midianites, as commanded by God in <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31:1-2</a>. This conflict was not merely a territorial dispute but a divine judgment against Midian for leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (<a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>). The returning soldiers were expected to have carried out God's specific instructions, which included the complete destruction of the Midianites. The failure to fully obey these instructions, as later verses reveal, is the source of Moses' anger. This incident highlights the importance of complete obedience to God's commands and foreshadows the consequences of partial obedience seen throughout Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

He had just delivered God&#8217;s explicit instructions to &#8220;execute the LORD&#8217;s vengeance on Midian&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>), so their half-hearted compliance dishonored the Lord.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that spiritual leaders must reflect God&#8217;s heart, even when that means confronting sin (<a href="/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19-20</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the officers of the army</b><p>&#8226; Targeting the officers shows that accountability rises with authority (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; They had the responsibility to ensure every soldier followed the divine mandate. When leadership falters, the whole community suffers (<a href="/joshua/22-20.htm">Joshua 22:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses&#8217; focus on officers echoes Jethro&#8217;s structure in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, underscoring God&#8217;s design for ordered oversight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds</b><p>&#8226; These two ranks embrace the entire military chain of command.
