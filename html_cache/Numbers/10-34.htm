This cloud, often referred to as the Shekinah glory, was a visible manifestation of God's presence. It first appeared in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The cloud signifies God's protection and leadership, ensuring the Israelites knew He was with them. This presence is a type of Christ, who is described as the light of the world in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, guiding believers in their spiritual journey.<p><b>was over them by day</b><br>The cloud provided shade and protection from the harsh desert sun, symbolizing God's care and provision. This protection is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5-6</a>, where God is described as a shade at the right hand, protecting from the sun by day. The constant presence of the cloud reassured the Israelites of God's continual oversight and care, much like the Holy Spirit's role in the life of a believer today.<p><b>when they set out from the camp</b><br>The movement of the cloud dictated the Israelites' journey, indicating when they should travel and when they should rest. This reflects the importance of obedience and reliance on God's timing and direction. The Israelites' journey from the camp is a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to follow God's leading. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, where those led by the Spirit of God are called sons of God. The setting out from the camp also signifies a step of faith, trusting in God's provision and guidance for the unknown journey ahead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were journeying from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud_of_the_lord.htm">The Cloud of the LORD</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence and guidance, leading the Israelites through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area through which the Israelites traveled, representing both physical and spiritual challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicated God's instructions to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>The temporary dwelling place of the Israelites, which they set out from as they followed God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_guidance.htm">God's Presence and Guidance</a></b><br>The cloud symbolizes God's constant presence and guidance in our lives.
