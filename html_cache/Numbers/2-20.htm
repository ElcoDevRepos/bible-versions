This reflects the close relationship between the two tribes, as both are sons of Joseph. Manasseh's placement is significant in the context of Israel's journey through the wilderness, as it highlights the unity and organization necessary for the Israelites' survival and success. Historically, the tribe of Manasseh was known for its large territory, which was divided between the east and west of the Jordan River. This division is a reminder of the tribe's significant role in the conquest and settlement of the Promised Land. The positioning of the tribes around the Tabernacle also symbolizes the centrality of worship and God's presence among His people.<p><b>The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,</b><br>Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, is identified as the leader of the tribe of Manasseh. His name, meaning "God is my reward," reflects the faith and reliance on God that leaders were expected to embody. The mention of his father, Pedahzur, provides a genealogical link that was important for establishing authority and legitimacy within the tribal structure. In the broader biblical narrative, leaders like Gamaliel were responsible for representing their tribes in matters of governance, military organization, and religious observance. This leadership role is crucial in maintaining order and ensuring that the tribe fulfills its responsibilities to the community and to God. The appointment of leaders from each tribe also underscores the importance of shared leadership and accountability in the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph.
