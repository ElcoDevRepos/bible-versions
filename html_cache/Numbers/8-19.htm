This separation underscores the importance of holiness and order in worship. The Levites' role as a "gift" highlights their special status and function within the Israelite community. This concept of being set apart is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The Levites' service included tasks such as setting up, taking down, and transporting the Tabernacle, as well as assisting in the various rituals and sacrifices. This service was crucial for maintaining the spiritual life of the nation and ensuring that worship was conducted according to God's commands.<p><b>and to make atonement on their behalf</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through sacrifice. The Levites played a role in the sacrificial system, which pointed forward to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> states, "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness," highlighting the necessity of atonement in the biblical narrative.<p><b>so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary</b><br>The presence of God in the sanctuary was both a blessing and a danger. Approaching God required purity and obedience to His commands. The Levites' role in maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle helped prevent divine judgment, such as plagues, from falling upon the people.

It is usually confined to purely sacerdotal ministrations, but it clearly has a somewhat different scope here. The idea that the Levites "made an atonement" by assisting the priests in the subordinate details of sacrifice hardly needs refutation: as well might the Gibeonites be said to "make an atonement" because they supplied the altar fire with wood. The real parallel to this is to be found in the case of Phinehas, of whom God testified that "he hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel," and "made an atonement for the children of Israel" (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11, 13</a>). It is evident that Phinehas turned away the wrath of God not by offering any sacrifices, but by making the sin which aroused that wrath to cease: he made an atonement for the people by discharging for them that holy and bounden duty (of putting away sin) which the rest of them failed to perform. Similarly the Levites made an atonement not by offering sacrifice (which they could no more do than the children of Judah), but by rendering unto God those personal duties of attendance and service in his courts which <span class="accented">all</span> the people ought to have rendered had they only been fit. <span class="cmt_word">That there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.</span> See <a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>. The children of Israel were in this strait. As "an holy nation," they were all bound, and their first-born as redeemed from the destroyer were specially bound, to render certain religious duties to God. But if they had attempted to render them they would have erred through ignorance and foolishness, and so <span class="accented">have</span> incurred Divine wrath and punishment, when they came nigh unto the sanctuary. From this strait the substitution of the Levites delivered them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/8-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I have given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;et&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
