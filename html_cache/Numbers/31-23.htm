In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, the Israelites had just defeated the Midianites, and God instructed them on how to purify the plunder. The use of fire for purification is symbolic of God's holiness and judgment, as fire often represents purification and the presence of God (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). The fire tests the durability and purity of materials, separating what is valuable from what is not, much like God's refining process for believers (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p><b>and it will be clean</b><br>The result of passing through the fire is cleanliness, signifying that the object is now fit for use by the Israelites. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purification and sanctification, where God calls His people to be holy and set apart (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The concept of cleanliness is not just physical but also spiritual, pointing to the need for inner purity (<a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>).<p><b>But it must still be purified with the water of purification</b><br>Even after passing through the fire, the items require further purification with water. This dual process underscores the thoroughness required for true purification. The water of purification likely refers to the water mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, as described in <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>, which was used for ceremonial cleansing. Water is a common biblical symbol for cleansing and renewal (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), and it prefigures the cleansing work of Christ, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>).<p><b>And everything that cannot withstand the fire must pass through the water</b><br>Items unable to endure fire, such as fabrics or wooden objects, are purified solely with water. This provision shows God's understanding and accommodation of different materials, reflecting His wisdom and care. The use of water alone for purification highlights the adaptability of God's laws to various circumstances. This also points to the inclusive nature of God's grace, which purifies all who come to Him, regardless of their condition (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received God's instructions regarding the purification of spoils taken from the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were commanded to purify the spoils of war.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions were subject to purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purification_process.htm">Purification Process</a></b><br>The ritual cleansing of items taken from the Midianites, involving fire and water.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/water_of_purification.htm">Water of Purification</a></b><br>A special water used for cleansing, symbolizing spiritual purification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_purification.htm">The Necessity of Purification</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were required to purify the spoils of war, believers are called to purify their lives from sin and worldly influences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fire_as_a_symbol_of_testing_and_purification.htm">Fire as a Symbol of Testing and Purification</a></b><br>The use of fire in purification symbolizes the trials and tests that refine our faith and character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/water_as_a_symbol_of_spiritual_cleansing.htm">Water as a Symbol of Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>The water of purification represents the cleansing power of God's Word and the Holy Spirit in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_everyday_life.htm">Holiness in Everyday Life</a></b><br>The command to purify even material possessions underscores the call to holiness in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_purification.htm">God's Provision for Purification</a></b><br>The provision of specific means for purification in the Old Testament points to God's ultimate provision for our purification through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_31_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 31:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_23_Purification_s_importance.htm">How does Numbers 31:23 emphasize the importance of purification in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_impurities_need_fire_or_water_today.htm">What spiritual impurities might require "fire" or "water" for purification today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_31_23_to_NT_purification.htm">How does Numbers 31:23 connect with New Testament teachings on purification?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Numbers_31_23_daily.htm">In what ways can we apply purification principles from Numbers 31:23 daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/When_to_use_fire_vs_water_for_cleansing.htm">How can we discern when to use "fire" versus "water" for spiritual cleansing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_23_and_God_s_mercy.htm">How does Numbers 31:23 align with the concept of a loving and merciful God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_purify_with_fire_and_water_in_Num_31_23.htm">Why does Numbers 31:23 emphasize purification through fire and water?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_Numbers_31_23_instructions_given.htm">What historical context explains the instructions in Numbers 31:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'baptism_of_fire'_mean.htm">What does 'baptism of fire' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_numbers_2_camp_survive_sinai.htm">How could a vast encampment described in Numbers 2 feasibly survive in the Sinai Desert with limited resources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/mark_9_49-50__evidence_for_'salted_with_fire'.htm">Mark 9:49-50 -

Before any spoils or soldiers may re-enter the camp, God issues detailed instructions through Moses and Eleazar. The overriding concern is holiness&#8212;so that no defilement enters the community where the Lord dwells (compare <a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>). <a href="/numbers/31-23.htm">Numbers 31:23</a> is part of that purification protocol.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why purification mattered</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence in the camp demanded stringent cleanness (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Contact with corpses rendered people and objects ceremonially unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Purifying the spoils protected the nation from spiritual compromise, much like Joshua later warned about devoted things from Jericho (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>&#8211;12).<p>&#8226; These regulations foreshadowed the need for deeper cleansing in every heart (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Everything that can withstand the fire&#8212;must be put through the fire"</b><p>&#8226; Metals such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead (v. 22) would survive intense heat.<p>&#8226; Fire burns away impurity and dross (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The same principle appears when God refines His people&#8217;s faith through trials (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, literal flames sterilize the utensils soldiers captured, making them fit for sacred use.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"And it will be clean."</b><p>&#8226; After passing through fire, the item is declared ceremonially clean&#8212;ready for service.<p>&#8226; Cleanness is not earned by the object but granted by obedience to God&#8217;s method (<a href="/leviticus/11-32.htm">Leviticus 11:32&#8211;35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"But it must still be purified with the water of purification."</b><p>&#8226; Even heat-resistant items required a secondary washing with the water mixed from the red-heifer ashes (<a href="/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9, 17</a>).<p>&#8226; This shows holiness is never one-dimensional. Outer cleansing must coincide with God-appointed ritual, pointing ahead to Christ&#8217;s all-sufficient cleansing (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire addressed external contaminants; water symbolized removal of corpse defilement (<a href="/jeremiah/2-22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Everything that cannot withstand the fire must pass through the water."</b><p>&#8226; Wood, leather, cloth, and similar materials would be ruined by flames, so God graciously provides an alternative.<p>&#8226; The same purifying water achieves cleanness without destroying the object&#8212;illustrating God&#8217;s concern for both holiness and mercy (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, water imagery shifts to spiritual washing in the word (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>) and baptism as an appeal for a clean conscience (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living lessons today</b><p>&#8226; God alone defines what is unclean and how it is removed (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Some impurities require the &#8220;fire&#8221; of testing; others are washed away through the &#8220;water&#8221; of His word and Spirit.<p>&#8226; The Lord refines but never destroys what He intends to use&#8212;He purifies to restore usefulness (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to His revealed process opens the door for fellowship and service (<a href="/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-23.htm">Numbers 31:23</a> teaches that whatever can endure fire must be purified by fire and then washed, while fragile items are cleansed by water alone. Fire removes physical impurity; water deals with ceremonial defilement. Together they picture God&#8217;s comprehensive work of purification&#8212;thorough, purposeful, and always grounded in obedience to His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall make it go</span> <span class="cmt_word">through the fire.</span> This was an addition to the general law of lustration in chapter 19 founded on the obvious fact that water does not cleanse metals, while fire does.
