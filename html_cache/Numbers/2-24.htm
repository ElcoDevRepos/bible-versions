The tribe of Ephraim held a prominent position among the tribes, often leading the northern tribes. The census here reflects the military organization of Israel as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The divisions indicate a structured and orderly approach to their journey, emphasizing God's command for order and preparation.<p><b>is 108,100;</b><br>The specific number of 108,100 men indicates the size and strength of the tribe of Ephraim at this time. This number reflects the men who were able to go to war, highlighting the tribe's capacity for battle. The precision of the number underscores the importance of each tribe's contribution to the collective strength of Israel. This also shows God's provision and blessing upon the tribe, as they had grown significantly since their time in Egypt.<p><b>they shall set out third.</b><br>The order of march was divinely appointed, with Ephraim positioned to set out third. This placement signifies Ephraim's role as a leader among the tribes, following Judah and Reuben. The order of march was not only practical but also symbolic, reflecting the hierarchy and roles within the nation. Ephraim's position as third in line underscores their importance and the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's descendants.
