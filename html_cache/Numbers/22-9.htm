Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is approached by God, highlighting God's sovereignty over all nations and peoples. This encounter underscores the theme that God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes, regardless of their background. Theologically, it reflects the idea that God communicates His will directly, even to those outside the covenant community of Israel. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the unfolding events where Balaam's actions will be influenced by divine intervention.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Who are these men with you?&#8221;</b><br>God's question to Balaam serves multiple purposes. It is not due to a lack of knowledge, as God is omniscient, but rather to prompt Balaam to reflect on his associations and intentions. This question can be seen as a test of Balaam's discernment and loyalty. In the broader biblical context, similar divine inquiries are used to provoke self-examination and confession, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> when God asks Adam, "Where are you?" The presence of these men, sent by Balak, king of Moab, represents a temptation for Balaam to act against God's will for personal gain. This interaction foreshadows the tension between divine command and human ambition that will characterize Balaam's story.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner known for his ability to bless or curse.
