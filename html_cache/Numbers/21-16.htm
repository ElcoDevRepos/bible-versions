"Beer" means "well" in Hebrew, signifying a place where water is found. This journey is part of the Israelites' 40-year wandering after their exodus from Egypt, as they move towards the Promised Land. The location of Beer is not precisely known, but it is significant as a place of divine provision.<p><b>the well where the LORD said to Moses</b><br>The mention of a well highlights God's provision for His people in the desert, a recurring theme in the Israelites' journey. Wells were crucial in the arid regions of the Near East, serving as vital sources of water. This well is notable because it is directly associated with a divine command, emphasizing God's active role in guiding and sustaining the Israelites. The LORD speaking to Moses underscores Moses' role as the mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who mediates the New Covenant.<p><b>&#8220;Gather the people so that I may give them water.&#8221;</b><br>This command reflects God's continual care and provision for the Israelites, despite their frequent complaints and lack of faith. Water is a symbol of life and sustenance, and in the biblical narrative, it often represents spiritual nourishment and the Holy Spirit. This event can be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus' offer of "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, where He speaks to the Samaritan woman at the well. The gathering of the people also signifies unity and collective reliance on God's provision, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture as God calls His people to come together in faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
