The context is a series of oracles Balaam delivers, which instead of cursing Israel as Balak desired, blesses them. The command to "flee" indicates urgency and frustration from Balak, who feels betrayed by Balaam's actions. The cultural context here is one of ancient Near Eastern practices where kings would often employ prophets or seers to pronounce blessings or curses, believing these words held power over the outcomes of battles or political situations. The phrase also reflects the tension between human plans and divine intervention, as Balaam's prophecies were directed by God, not by Balak's desires.<p><b>I said I would reward you richly,</b><br>Balak had promised Balaam great wealth and honor if he would curse the Israelites. This reflects the common practice of the time where prophets or diviners were compensated for their services, especially when they were expected to influence the spiritual realm. The promise of a "rich reward" underscores the value placed on spiritual manipulation in ancient cultures. This also highlights the theme of material wealth versus spiritual obedience, as Balaam ultimately chooses to speak the words God gives him, despite the potential for personal gain.<p><b>but instead the LORD has denied your reward.&#8221;</b><br>This statement acknowledges the sovereignty of the LORD (Yahweh) over the situation. Despite Balak's intentions and promises, it is God who controls the outcome. The use of "the LORD" emphasizes the covenant name of God, indicating His authority and relationship with Israel. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the futility of opposing God's will. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the theme that true reward comes from obedience to God rather than from human sources. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus speaks about storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who sought to curse the Israelites through Balaam.

Balak is learning this firsthand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>flee at once to your home!</b><p>&#8226; Balak dismisses Balaam in humiliation, not negotiation; the conversation is over.<p>&#8226; Similar dismissals appear when God intervenes&#8212;think of Pharaoh telling Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Leave my presence!&#8221; after another judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s journey home becomes a symbol of thwarted human schemes: &#8220;Many are the plans in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I said I would reward you richly,</b><p>&#8226; Balak reminds Balaam of the earlier bribe: &#8220;I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say to me&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns about trading truth for profit. Balaam&#8217;s name later becomes shorthand for greed-driven compromise (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By dangling riches, Balak hoped to bend spiritual authority to political ends, a tactic still common whenever power tries to purchase prophecy (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but instead the LORD has denied your reward.</b><p>&#8226; Even Balak, a pagan king, concedes God&#8217;s supremacy. He blames the LORD, not Balaam&#8217;s lack of effort, acknowledging that heaven overrules earth (<a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8, 20</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-5.htm">Deuteronomy 23:5</a> recalls the same event: &#8220;But the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam; He turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Every attempt to curse God&#8217;s people is ultimately &#8220;denied&#8221; by Him who blesses (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).
