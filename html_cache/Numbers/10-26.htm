The naming of leaders by their fathers' names underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israel. This practice also highlights the continuity of God's promises through generations, as seen in the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament (Matthew 1, <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>).<p><b>was over the division</b><br>The term "division" refers to the organized military and social structure of the Israelite camp. Each tribe was divided into divisions, which were further organized into smaller units. This structure was crucial for maintaining order during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. It reflects God's command for order and discipline among His people, as seen in the detailed instructions for the camp's arrangement in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. This organization also prefigures the order and unity expected in the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.<p><b>of the tribe of Asher</b><br>Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, was named after Jacob's eighth son by Zilpah, Leah's maidservant (<a href="/genesis/30-12.htm">Genesis 30:12-13</a>). The tribe of Asher was known for its abundance and prosperity, as prophesied by Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, "Asher&#8217;s food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king." This blessing is echoed in Moses' blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>, where Asher is described as "most blessed of sons." The tribe's location in the fertile region of northern Canaan contributed to its prosperity. Asher's role in the wilderness journey and its later settlement in the Promised Land illustrate God's provision and faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagiel.htm">Pagiel</a></b><br>He is the son of Ocran and the leader of the tribe of Asher during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.
