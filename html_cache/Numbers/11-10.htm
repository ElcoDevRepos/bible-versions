The weeping at the entrances of their tents signifies a public display of dissatisfaction, indicating that the issue was widespread and affected the entire community. In the context of the wilderness journey, the tents symbolize temporary dwelling places, reflecting the transient nature of their journey and the instability they felt. The Israelites' weeping can be seen as a lack of faith in God's provision, echoing previous instances of grumbling (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). This communal lamentation contrasts with the individual faith of leaders like Moses and Joshua.<p><b>and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly</b><br>The phrase underscores God's righteous indignation towards the Israelites' lack of trust and gratitude. Throughout the Pentateuch, God's anger is often depicted as a response to disobedience and unbelief (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). The use of "kindled" suggests a growing intensity, indicating that this was not the first instance of such behavior. God's anger serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing His holiness and justice. This divine response foreshadows the consequences of continued rebellion, as seen later in the wilderness wanderings.<p><b>and Moses was also displeased</b><br>Moses' displeasure reflects his role as mediator between God and the people. His frustration is understandable given the repeated challenges he faced in leading a rebellious people (<a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>). Moses' reaction can be seen as a type of Christ, who also bore the burdens of the people and interceded on their behalf (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). This moment highlights the human aspect of leadership and the emotional toll it can take, as well as the need for reliance on God's strength and wisdom. Moses' displeasure sets the stage for his subsequent intercession and dialogue with God, demonstrating his deep commitment to his calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The murmuring indeed of the people was directed against God, and against Moses as his minister. The invisible King and his visible viceroy could not be separated in the regard of the people, and their concerted exhibition of misery was intended primarily for the eye of the latter. It was, therefore, no wonder that such conduct roused the wrath of Moses, who had no right to be angry, as well as the wrath of God, who had every right to be. angry. Moses sinned because he failed to restrain his temper within the exact limits of what befits the creature, and to distinguish carefully between a righteous indignation for Cod and an angry impatience with men. But he sinned under very sore provocation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
