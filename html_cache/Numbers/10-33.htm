After receiving the Law and instructions at Mount Sinai, they are now moving towards the Promised Land. The "three-day journey" is a common biblical motif, often symbolizing a period of preparation or transition (e.g., <a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>). It indicates a short but significant journey, emphasizing the immediacy and importance of their movement.<p><b>from the mountain of the LORD</b><br>The "mountain of the LORD" refers to Mount Sinai, where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and other laws. This mountain is a place of divine revelation and covenant-making, symbolizing God's presence and authority. The departure from Sinai signifies a shift from receiving the Law to living it out in their journey towards Canaan.<p><b>with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them</b><br>The ark of the covenant is central to Israel's worship and identity, representing God's presence among His people. Its position at the front of the procession underscores its role as a guide and protector. The ark leading the way is a physical manifestation of God's leadership and guidance, similar to how the pillar of cloud and fire led them earlier (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><b>for those three days</b><br>The repetition of "three days" emphasizes the completeness and divine orchestration of this journey. It suggests a divinely appointed time frame, echoing other significant three-day periods in Scripture, such as Jesus' resurrection after three days, which signifies new beginnings and fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>to seek a resting place for them</b><br>This phrase highlights God's care and provision for His people. The "resting place" is not just a physical location but also a spiritual state of peace and security, foreshadowing the ultimate rest found in the Promised Land. It also points to the eschatological rest promised to believers in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>), where true rest is found in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are on their journey from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain_of_the_lord.htm">The Mountain of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to Mount Sinai, where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses and established His covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, symbolizing God's presence and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_three-day_journey.htm">The Three-Day Journey</a></b><br>A specific period marking the beginning of the Israelites' journey from Sinai, emphasizing their reliance on God's guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resting_place.htm">The Resting Place</a></b><br>A destination or temporary stop where the Israelites could find rest, symbolizing God's provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_guidance.htm">God's Guidance</a></b><br>Just as the Ark of the Covenant led the Israelites, believers today are guided by the Holy Spirit.

The obvious objection to this supposition arising out of the fact that the cloud which directed the march rested upon, or over, the ark may be overcome by the consideration that the cloud appears to have extended over the whole of the host during the journeys, and to have served as a protection from the scorching heat (see <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; also <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-12.htm" title="Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.">Nehemiah 9:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-39.htm" title="He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.">Psalm 105:39</a>). On the other hand, the natural interpretation of this verse is that the ark was borne in front of the host, and did not merely serve to direct its line of march as a general, whose station might be in any part of an army. This interpretation is confirmed by <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-33.htm" title="Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>, and also by the position which the ark occupied at the passage of the Jordan. In the latter case the people were expressly directed to <span class= "ital">go </span>after the ark (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm" title="And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.">Joshua 3:3</a>); and in <a href="/numbers/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.">Numbers 10:11</a> the same word is used which occurs in this verse, "the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over <span class= "ital">before </span>you into Jordan." It will not follow, however, as a necessary inference, that the ark uniformly occupied the same position in all the journeys, and it cannot be denied that <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm" title="And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.">Numbers 10:21</a> presents a difficulty, partly arising from the ambiguity of meaning which is to be attached to the word <span class= "ital">mikdash, sanctuary, </span>and partly from the omission of any word in the Hebrew corresponding to the words in italics, <span class= "ital">the other. </span>Ibn Ezra thinks that this three days' journey was different from all the other journeys in respect of the position of the ark. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they departed.</span> These words mark the moment of actual departure, which has been anticipated in the general statement of verse 12. It was one of the supreme moments in the life of Israel - one of those beginnings or "departures" which lead to untold gain or loss; it was, in fact, although they knew it not, the commencement of a march which for almost all of them should know no end except within a hasty grave. No doubt, during the months spent at Sinai, <span class="accented">every</span> preparation had been made for the onward journey; but none the less it was a stupendous enterprise to march that vast host, so largely composed of women and children, so little inured to such fatigue, and so impatient of such discipline, for three consecutive days into a wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Three days' journey.</span> This expression is apparently a general <span class="accented">one</span>, and not to be strictly pressed (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). At the same time it implies <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the host twice halted for the night during the journey, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the whole journey was regarded as one and in some sense as complete in itself. <p>The <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of this three days' journey is given us in verse 12; it was to take them across the intervening belt of sand, and to land them fairly within the "wilderness of Paran." During this journey no doubt the march would be pushed on as steadily as possible, but it is not likely that it would cover so much as thirty miles. A modern army, unencumbered with non-combatants, does not make more than ten miles a day over difficult country, nor can cattle be driven faster than that.
