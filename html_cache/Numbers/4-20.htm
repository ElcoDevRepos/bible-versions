They were responsible for the most sacred duties in the tabernacle, including the care of the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role highlights the importance of their duties and the need for strict adherence to God's commands.<p><b>are not to go in and look at the holy objects</b><br>The holy objects refer to the sacred items within the tabernacle, which were considered the dwelling place of God's presence. The prohibition against looking at these objects underscores the holiness and separateness of God. This command reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for reverence and respect in approaching Him, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>.<p><b>even for a moment</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the severity and immediacy of the command. The holiness of God required absolute obedience and respect, and even a brief glance could result in dire consequences. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God's commands are to be taken seriously and followed precisely.<p><b>or they will die</b><br>The consequence of death for disobedience highlights the seriousness of the command and the holiness of God. This is consistent with other instances in the Old Testament where disobedience to God's commands resulted in death, such as the case of Uzzah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>. It serves as a reminder of the need for reverence and the seriousness of approaching a holy God. This also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who through His death, allows believers to approach God with confidence, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical clan responsible for the care of the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant.

whenever the tabernacle moved (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>).<p>- This privileged assignment underscored both honor and danger: handling the holiest objects came with the strictest safeguards (<a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are not to go in</b><p>- They were forbidden to enter the sanctuary while Aaron and his sons were covering the furnishings (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>- The command mirrors earlier warnings: &#8220;Do not come near the sanctuary lest you die&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51</a>).<p>- God sets boundaries so that His presence does not break out against even those set apart for service (<a href="/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and look at the holy objects</b><p>- The &#8220;holy objects&#8221;

The Kohathites&#8217; noble task never granted casual access; a single forbidden glance at the uncovered holy objects meant death. The verse magnifies God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness, the necessity of mediating priests, and the life-and-death stakes of obedience&#8212;a timeless call for reverent, wholehearted submission to the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">But they shall not go in to see the holy things </span>(or, the sanctuary) <span class= "ital">for a moment. </span>The Levites were not per-mitted to enter the holy place in which the priests ministered, much less the Holy of Holies. Whether this rule was or was not relaxed at the time of the removal of the Tabernacle, as the prohibition against entrance into the Holy of Holies must have been in regard to the priests, the Levites were not permitted in any case to look upon the Ark and the other holy things until they were covered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered.</span> This translation is disputed. The word rendered "are covered" is the Piel infinitive from <span class="accented">bala</span>, to swallow, and so to destroy. It may signify the extreme rapidity with which the most holy things were hidden from sight and removed from touch, so as to become, as it were, non-existent for the time. So the Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, and the Targums of Onkelos and Palestine. On the other hand, it may be a proverbial expression, "in a swallow, at a gulp," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "for an instant," as in <a href="/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>. And so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and most modern scholars. Whichever way, however, we take it, the phrase, "they shall not go in to see," seems to limit the prohibition under pain of death to the deliberate act of entering the tabernacle out of curiosity during the process of packing up the holy things. The case of the men of Bethshemesh, therefore (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>), does not fall within the letter of this law, although it does within its spirit. The command, thus limited, is no doubt an addition to the previous command not to touch, but it is altogether in keeping with it. If it was the will of God to hedge about these sacred symbols of his presence and his worship with an awful sanctity, it is obvious that he was as much bound to defend them against the irreverent prying of the eye as against the irreverent touch of the hand; and the prying here prohibited would have been distinctly willful and inexcusable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/4-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But [the Kohathites] are not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
