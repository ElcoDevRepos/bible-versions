The mention of his sons, particularly Dathan and Abiram, is significant due to their role in the rebellion against Moses. Nemuel, also known as Jemuel in some translations, is less prominent in biblical narratives. The Reubenites, as descendants of the firstborn, may have felt entitled to leadership, which could have contributed to their dissatisfaction and subsequent rebellion.<p><b>It was Dathan and Abiram, chosen by the congregation,</b><br>Dathan and Abiram were leaders within the tribe of Reuben and were chosen by the congregation, indicating they held positions of influence and authority. This choice reflects the political dynamics within the Israelite community, where leadership was often contested. Their selection by the congregation suggests they had significant support, which underscores the gravity of their rebellion.<p><b>who rebelled against Moses and Aaron</b><br>The rebellion against Moses and Aaron was not merely a personal vendetta but a challenge to the divinely appointed leadership structure. Moses and Aaron were chosen by God to lead the Israelites, and any rebellion against them was seen as a rebellion against God's authority. This event highlights the recurring theme of Israel's struggle with obedience and submission to God's chosen leaders.<p><b>with the followers of Korah</b><br>Korah, a Levite, led a significant rebellion against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and the priestly privileges. The alliance between Korah, Dathan, and Abiram represents a coalition of discontented leaders from different tribes, united in their challenge to the established order. This rebellion is a pivotal moment in Israel's wilderness journey, illustrating the dangers of pride and ambition.<p><b>who rebelled against the LORD.</b><br>The rebellion is ultimately framed as an act against the LORD, emphasizing the theological perspective that defiance against God's appointed leaders is equivalent to defiance against God Himself. This underscores the seriousness of the rebellion and serves as a warning to future generations about the consequences of challenging divine authority. The judgment that follows, where the earth swallows the rebels, serves as a dramatic demonstration of God's power and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliab.htm">Eliab</a></b><br>Father of Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram.

By inserting these names, Scripture ties the memory of rebellion directly to a specific family line within Reuben, underscoring how sin leaves a historic mark (cf. <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-17.htm">Joshua 22:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chosen by the congregation</b><p>- The verse notes that Dathan and Abiram were &#8220;chosen by the congregation.&#8221; They were respected leaders, elected voices among the people (<a href="/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a>).<p>- Their selection shows that popularity does not equal righteousness; even well-regarded men can steer a community toward disaster (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rebelled against Moses and Aaron</b><p>- Dathan and Abiram &#8220;rebelled against Moses and Aaron,&#8221; rejecting God-appointed leadership (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>).<p>- Their defiance illustrates a deeper heart issue: disdain for divine order. Paul later warns believers against &#8220;testing the Lord, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by snakes&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-9.htm">1 Corinthians 10:9&#8211;10</a>), echoing this episode.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With Korah&#8217;s followers</b><p>- The verse links them &#8220;with the followers of Korah.&#8221; <a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a> records how Korah, from the tribe of Levi, gathered 250 men to challenge Moses&#8217; authority.<p>- By aligning with Korah, Dathan and Abiram merged civil and priestly rebellion, triggering a judgment that swallowed them alive (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>). Unity in sin multiplies its consequences (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rebelled against the LORD</b><p>- Ultimately, Scripture clarifies that their quarrel was not merely horizontal; they &#8220;rebelled against the LORD.&#8221; Resisting God&#8217;s mediator equaled resisting God Himself (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>- <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a> recalls this event to warn the church about false teachers who follow &#8220;Korah&#8217;s rebellion,&#8221; proving that such defiance is timeless in its danger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-9.htm">Numbers 26:9</a> soberly reminds us that notable, even elected, figures can lead God&#8217;s people into catastrophic rebellion. By tracing Dathan and Abiram back to their family line, God shows that He records both faithfulness and unfaithfulness with equal precision. The verse teaches that rejecting divinely established leadership is, in essence, rejecting the LORD, and it warns every generation to anchor its loyalty to God&#8217;s appointed Word and servants rather than to popular sentiment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/26-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
