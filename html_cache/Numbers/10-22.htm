Ephraim was the second son of Joseph, and his descendants were blessed by Jacob to become a "multitude of nations" (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). The camp of Ephraim was positioned on the west side of the tabernacle, and they were the third group to set out during the Israelites' journey, following the tribes of Judah and Reuben. This order reflects the structured and organized nature of the Israelite encampment and journey, emphasizing the importance of order and obedience in following God's commands.<p><b>under their standard</b><br>Each tribe of Israel had its own standard or banner, which served as a rallying point and symbol of identity. The standard of Ephraim would have been a significant emblem, possibly featuring an ox, which is traditionally associated with this tribe. Standards were important for maintaining order during travel and battle, and they also held spiritual significance, representing the presence and guidance of God among His people.<p><b>with Elishama son of Ammihud in command</b><br>Elishama, the son of Ammihud, was the leader of the tribe of Ephraim during the wilderness period. His name means "God has heard," which may reflect the faith and reliance on God that characterized the leadership of the tribes. As a leader, Elishama would have been responsible for the welfare and organization of his tribe, ensuring that they followed the directives given by Moses and ultimately by God.
