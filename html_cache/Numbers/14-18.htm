Throughout the Old Testament, God demonstrates His willingness to withhold immediate judgment, giving people time to repent. This is evident in His dealings with Israel, as seen in the repeated cycles of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance in the Book of Judges. The Hebrew word for "slow" can also be translated as "long," indicating a deliberate restraint in anger.<p><b>and abounding in loving devotion</b><br>The term "loving devotion" is often translated as "steadfast love" or "mercy" (Hebrew: "chesed"). This covenantal love is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's unwavering commitment to His people. It is seen in His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and ultimately fulfilled in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. This steadfast love is a key aspect of God's character, as celebrated in Psalms and the Prophets.<p><b>forgiving iniquity and transgression</b><br>God's willingness to forgive is a cornerstone of His relationship with humanity. Iniquity and transgression refer to different aspects of sin: iniquity involves a moral distortion, while transgression implies a rebellion against God's law. The sacrificial system in the Old Testament, particularly the Day of Atonement, foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness found in Christ's sacrifice, as explained in <a href="/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9-10</a>.<p><b>Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished</b><br>This phrase underscores God's justice. While He is merciful, He is also righteous and cannot ignore sin. The balance between mercy and justice is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the prophetic books where God calls for repentance but also warns of impending judgment. This duality is perfectly reconciled in the cross of Christ, where God's justice and mercy meet.<p><b>He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation</b><br>This reflects the communal and generational impact of sin in ancient Israelite society. The consequences of one's actions often affected their descendants, a concept seen in the stories of Achan (Joshua 7) and the house of Eli (1 Samuel 3). However, <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a> emphasizes individual responsibility, showing a progression in understanding God's justice. This phrase also serves as a warning of the pervasive nature of sin and its potential to influence future generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, characterized by His attributes of patience, love, and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes for the people in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are wandering in the wilderness due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_paran.htm">Wilderness of Paran</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are camped when this declaration is made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_iniquity_of_the_fathers.htm">The Iniquity of the Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the sins and transgressions of the ancestors that have consequences for future generations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_mercy.htm">God's Patience and Mercy</a></b><br>God is "slow to anger," demonstrating His patience and desire for repentance rather than immediate judgment.<br><br>Application: We should emulate God's patience in our interactions with others, offering grace and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/abounding_in_loving_devotion.htm">Abounding in Loving Devotion</a></b><br>God's love is steadfast and abundant, providing a foundation for His forgiveness.<br><br>Application: Trust in God's unwavering love, even when facing the consequences of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_justice.htm">Forgiveness and Justice</a></b><br>While God forgives iniquity and transgression, He also upholds justice by not leaving the guilty unpunished.<br><br>Application: Recognize the balance of God's mercy and justice in our lives, and strive to live righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_consequences.htm">Generational Consequences</a></b><br>The impact of sin can extend to future generations, highlighting the importance of living faithfully.<br><br>Application: Consider the legacy we leave for future generations and seek to break cycles of sin through repentance and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_advocacy.htm">Intercession and Advocacy</a></b><br>Moses' role as an intercessor for the Israelites demonstrates the power of prayer and advocacy.<br><br>Application: Be an advocate for others in prayer, seeking God's mercy and guidance for those in need.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_14_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 14:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_14_18_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">How does Numbers 14:18 reveal God's character of justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_slow_to_anger_show_God_s_patience.htm">What does "slow to anger" teach about God's patience with us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Numbers_14_18_forgiveness_to_us.htm">How can we apply God's forgiveness in Numbers 14:18 to our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_14_18_to_Psalm_103_8-12.htm">How does Numbers 14:18 connect with God's forgiveness in Psalm 103:8-12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_should_God_s_love_guide_our_actions.htm">In what ways should God's "abounding in loving devotion" influence our daily actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_14_18_balance_mercy_and_justice.htm">How does Numbers 14:18 reconcile God's mercy with punishing future generations for their ancestors' sins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_forgive_yet_hold_accountable_in_Num_14_18.htm">Why does God choose to forgive yet still hold people accountable in Numbers 14:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Numbers_14_18.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Numbers 14:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_forgiveness_defined.htm">How is forgiveness defined?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_god's_patience_consistent_with_swift_judgment.htm">Numbers 14:18 insists that God is slow to anger yet punishes sin;

God&#8217;s patience toward Israel was on display right before this verse, when the people rebelled at the report of the spies (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). Instead of destroying them immediately, &#8220;The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonah knew this same character trait when he said, &#8220;I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures readers that divine wrath is never impulsive. Judgment comes only after multiplied opportunities to repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>abounding in loving devotion</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s love rises far above the minimum; it &#8220;abounds.&#8221; &#8220;Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses had already heard this on Sinai: &#8220;The LORD&#8230;abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Such steady, overflowing love means God&#8217;s covenant affection remains even when His people wobble (<a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>forgiving iniquity and transgression</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance?&#8221; (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>).

The verse balances grace with accountability&#8212;no one can presume on mercy while clinging to rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation</b><p>&#8226; This echoes the second commandment: God &#8220;visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; What it means:<p>&#8211; Consequences ripple.

He waits long before anger, lavishes steadfast devotion, pardons sin when confessed, but never ignores guilt. Unchecked rebellion invites consequences that can echo through families, while repentance opens the floodgates of mercy. The verse calls every reader to trust God&#8217;s character, receive His forgiveness, and walk in obedience, knowing both kindness and seriousness are forever woven into His ways.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
