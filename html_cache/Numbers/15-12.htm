This phrase emphasizes the importance of following God's specific commands for offerings. The sacrificial system was central to Israelite worship and served as a means of atonement and fellowship with God. Each offering had to be prepared according to divine instructions, symbolizing obedience and reverence. This meticulous preparation foreshadows the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>no matter how many</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of consistency and equality in worship. Whether the offering was large or small, the preparation was to be the same, reflecting God's impartiality and the equal value of each person's worship. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching that God shows no favoritism (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>) and that all believers are equal in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).

Mean</div><b>This is how</b><p>The verse opens by pointing back to the detailed instructions in <a href="/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3-11</a> for grain, oil, and wine that accompany burnt or fellowship offerings. God provides very specific measurements&#8212;&#8220;a tenth of an ephah of fine flour,&#8221; &#8220;a quarter hin of oil,&#8221; and so on&#8212;so the worshiper never guesses at what pleases Him. Similar precision appears in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a> and <a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1-9</a>, showing a consistent biblical pattern: God&#8217;s holiness calls for worship on His terms, not ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must prepare</b><p>&#8220;Must&#8221; highlights obligation, not suggestion. Israel was to follow the recipe every time an animal was placed on the altar. Obedience in preparation mirrors <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221; The focus is less on culinary technique and more on the heart that obeys God&#8217;s word exactly. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a> reinforces this, commanding, &#8220;Do not add to it or subtract from it.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each one</b><p>The phrase individualizes the command. Whether someone offered a bull, ram, lamb, or young goat (<a href="/numbers/15-11.htm">Numbers 15:11</a>), the same rule applied. Personal wealth or social position did not change God&#8217;s requirement. This echoes <a href="/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a>: &#8220;You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born.&#8221; Every person, regardless of background, approached God the same way&#8212;through the prescribed offering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No matter how many</b><p>Whether it was one animal or a whole herd, the standard remained fixed. The repeated offerings of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>) illustrate how large numbers never relaxed the rulebook. Quantity did not dilute quality. <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-14</a> condemns cutting corners when offerings became numerous; faithful repetition protects worship from that drift. <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a> later reminds us that even countless Old Covenant sacrifices looked forward to Christ&#8217;s once-for-all offering, which also met every divine specification perfectly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12</a> teaches that God gives exact directions for worship, expects complete obedience from every individual, and maintains His standards consistently, whether offerings are few or many. The verse underscores His unwavering holiness and points us to the ultimate, perfectly prepared sacrifice of Christ, who fulfills every requirement on our behalf.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the number.</span> The strict proportion of the meat and drink offerings was to be carried out with respect to the numbers, as well as the individual value, of the sacrifices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/15-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3602.htm">Strong's 3602: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just so</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you must prepare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each one,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no matter how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">many.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(kam&#183;mis&#183;p&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4557.htm">Strong's 4557: </a> </span><span class="str2">A number, definite, indefinite, narration</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/15-12.htm">Numbers 15:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/15-12.htm">OT Law: Numbers 15:12 According to the number that you shall (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/15-11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 15:11"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 15:11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/15-13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 15:13"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 15:13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
