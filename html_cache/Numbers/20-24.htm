"Gathered to his people" suggests a reunion with ancestors, reflecting the belief in an afterlife or continued existence beyond death. This phrase is used for other patriarchs like Abraham and Isaac, emphasizing a continuity of faith and heritage. It underscores the communal aspect of Israelite identity, where individuals are part of a larger narrative and lineage.<p><b>he will not enter the land that I have given the Israelites,</b><br>Aaron, like Moses, is denied entry into the Promised Land due to disobedience. This highlights the seriousness of their actions and God's justice. The land is a central theme in the Pentateuch, representing God's promise and faithfulness. Aaron's exclusion serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin, even for leaders. It also foreshadows the eventual entry of the next generation, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan despite human failure.<p><b>because both of you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.</b><br>This refers to the incident in <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>, where Moses and Aaron failed to uphold God's holiness before the Israelites. Instead of speaking to the rock as commanded, Moses struck it, and Aaron shared in the responsibility. "Meribah" means "quarreling," reflecting the people's contentiousness and the leaders' failure to trust God fully. This event is pivotal, illustrating the theme of faith and obedience. It also serves as a typological foreshadowing of Christ, the true Rock, who provides living water, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
