The tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in a region known for its fertile land, which was suitable for their large herds of cattle. This location was strategically important, serving as a buffer against eastern invaders. The Gadites were known for their bravery and military prowess, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>, where they are described as valiant warriors. The mention of "clans" indicates the division of the tribe into family groups, which was a common practice for organizational and inheritance purposes.<p><b>and their registration numbered 40,500</b><br>This census was conducted in the plains of Moab, as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. The number 40,500 represents the men of fighting age, twenty years and older, capable of going to war. This census was the second one taken during the Israelites' wilderness journey, the first being recorded in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>. The decrease in numbers from the first census (45,650) to this one reflects the consequences of the Israelites' disobedience and the subsequent divine judgment during their 40 years in the wilderness. The census was crucial for military organization and for the allocation of land once they entered Canaan. The specific number also underscores the historical reliability of the biblical narrative, providing a detailed account of the Israelite community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a></b><br>Gad is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant.
