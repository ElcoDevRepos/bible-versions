The Moabites, descendants of Lot, and the Midianites, descendants of Abraham through Keturah, shared a common ancestry but often found themselves in opposition to Israel. This alliance reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice where tribes would unite against a perceived common threat. The elders of Midian were likely influential leaders, suggesting a formal diplomatic engagement between the two groups.<p><b>&#8220;This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of an ox licking up grass is a vivid metaphor for total consumption and destruction. This reflects the Moabites' fear of the Israelites, who had recently defeated the Amorites. The comparison to an ox, a common agricultural animal, emphasizes the thoroughness and inevitability of the threat. This fear is rooted in the Israelites' growing reputation as a powerful force, as seen in their victories over other nations, which is documented in the preceding chapters of Numbers.<p><b>Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time</b><br>Balak, the son of Zippor, is introduced as the reigning monarch of Moab. His leadership is significant in the narrative, as he seeks to counter the perceived threat of Israel through unconventional means, namely hiring Balaam to curse them. The mention of his lineage, "son of Zippor," is typical of biblical genealogical references, establishing his legitimacy and authority. Balak's actions set the stage for the subsequent events involving Balaam, which highlight themes of divine sovereignty and the futility of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Moab, the son of Lot.

They lived a semi-nomadic life on the steppes to the east of Moab and Ammon (cf. <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>), supporting themselves partly by grazing, and partly by the caravan trade (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>). Their institutions were no doubt patriarchal, like those of the modern Bedawin, and the "elders" were the sheiks of their tribes. <span class="cmt_word">As the ox licketh up the grass of the field.</span> The strong, scythe-like sweep of the ox's tongue was a simile admirable in itself, and most suitable to pastoral Moab and Midian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the Moabites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
