This command also highlights the communal responsibility of the Israelites to support the Levites, who serve a unique role among the tribes.<p><b>from the inheritance they will possess</b><br>The land inheritance was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Each tribe received a portion of the Promised Land, except for the Levites, who were set apart for priestly duties. This phrase underscores the principle of sharing God's blessings with those who serve Him, reflecting the communal and sacrificial nature of the Israelite society.<p><b>cities for the Levites to live in</b><br>The Levites were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were instead provided with cities scattered throughout Israel. This arrangement ensured that the Levites could perform their religious duties and teach the Law across the nation. It also symbolizes the presence of God among His people, as the Levites were His representatives.<p><b>and pasturelands around the cities</b><br>The provision of pasturelands was necessary for the Levites' sustenance, as they relied on livestock for food and offerings.

Much like <a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1-2</a>, where the people were to give materials for the tabernacle, this command underscores that giving is an act of obedience, not a suggestion.<p>&#8226; The authority is divine, not tribal or political. As in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>, the Levites depend on the Lord&#8217;s word for their provision.<p>&#8226; By starting with &#8220;command,&#8221; the passage reminds believers that generosity toward God&#8217;s servants is rooted in God&#8217;s own directive (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the inheritance they will possess</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;from the inheritance they will possess&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The land allotments in Canaan, detailed later in <a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;19</a>, are treated as certain even before conquest. God speaks in the future perfect: the land is as good as theirs because His promise is sure (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>).<p>&#8226; Every tribe&#8217;s inheritance is a gift; therefore, sharing a portion with the Levites is simply passing along what was first received from the Lord (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This principle foreshadows the New Testament call to steward whatever we &#8220;possess&#8221; for Kingdom purposes (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cities for the Levites to live in</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;cities for the Levites to live in&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Instead of one contiguous territory, the Levites receive forty-eight cities scattered among Israel (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-3</a>). This dispersal places priests and teachers within reach of every tribe (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrangement keeps spiritual guidance woven into daily community life, a pattern echoed when Jesus sends disciples two by two into various towns (<a href="/luke/9-6.htm">Luke 9:6</a>; 10:1).<p>&#8226; It also prevents the Levites from amassing political power tied to land, keeping their dependence&#8212;and influence&#8212;focused on service to God alone (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pasturelands around the cities</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and pasturelands around the cities.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Each Levitical city is encircled by common grazing areas (<a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4-5</a>). This provides food for flocks used in temple service and household sustenance (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>; 27:32).<p>&#8226; The arrangement safeguards the cities from being swallowed by urban expansion; land is set apart, much like the Sabbath principle sets apart time (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Giving both city and pastureland portrays a balanced provision&#8212;places to live and means to live&#8212;mirroring God&#8217;s holistic care for His servants (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a> establishes a God-ordered system of support for the Levites by directing every tribe to allocate living space and surrounding pasture from its own inheritance.

This legislation forms the natural sequel and complement of the Divine decrees already promulgated concerning the Levites. Separated from the rest of the tribes from the time of the first census (<a href="/numbers/1-49.htm">Numbers 1:49</a>), excluded from any tribal inheritance (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>), but endowed with tithes and offerings for their maintenance (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, etc.), it was also necessary that they should be provided with homes for themselves and their cattle. They might indeed have been left to exist as they could, and where they could, upon the provision made for them in the law. But, on the one hand, that provision was itself precarious, depending as it did upon the piety and good feeling of the people (which must often have been found wanting: cf. <a href="/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8, 9</a>); and, on the other, it is evident that the Levites were intended, as far as their family and social life was concerned, to share the ordinary comforts and enjoyments of Israelites. Nothing could have been more foreign to the Mosaic ideal than a ministry celibate, ascetic, and detached from this world's wealth, such as readily enough sprang up (whether intended or not) under the teaching of the gospel (cf. <a href="/luke/10-4.htm">Luke 10:4</a>; <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34, 35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7, 25, 26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18, 27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> undoubtedly means here a pasture, or a paddock, an enclosed place outside the town into which the cattle were driven by day to feed. It is possible that the A.V. may have used the word "suburbs" in that sense. To keep cattle to some extent was not only a universal custom, but was well-nigh a necessity of life in that age. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Command</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to give,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
