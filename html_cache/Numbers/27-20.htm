Moses, who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness, is instructed by God to pass on some of his authority to Joshua. This act signifies a divinely ordained succession plan, ensuring continuity in leadership. The Hebrew word for "authority" here can also mean "honor" or "majesty," indicating that Joshua is to be respected and followed as Moses was. This transfer is not just a political move but a spiritual one, as it involves God's blessing and guidance. The laying on of hands, which Moses performs later, is a symbolic act of this transfer, seen in other biblical contexts such as the ordination of priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>) and the commissioning of leaders (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>).<p><b>so that the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>The "whole congregation of Israel" refers to the entire community of Israelites, including all twelve tribes. This phrase emphasizes the unity and collective identity of the people as God's chosen nation. The congregation is not just a gathering of individuals but a covenant community bound by their relationship with God and their shared history. The leadership transition is crucial for maintaining this unity, as the people are on the brink of entering the Promised Land. The congregation's obedience to Joshua is essential for their success and survival, as they will face numerous challenges and battles in Canaan.<p><b>will obey him</b><br>Obedience to Joshua is a central theme in this passage. Joshua's leadership is legitimized by the authority conferred upon him by Moses, who is God's appointed servant. This obedience is not merely a matter of following orders but is deeply rooted in the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. The success of the Israelites in conquering the Promised Land is contingent upon their obedience to God's commands, as mediated through Joshua. This theme of obedience is echoed throughout the book of Joshua, where the people's adherence to God's instructions leads to victory, while disobedience results in setbacks (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1-5</a>). Joshua is a type of Christ, as he leads the people into the Promised Land, just as Jesus leads believers into the spiritual rest and inheritance promised by God (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses is told to lay his hands on Joshua (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18</a>) and &#8220;commission him in their sight&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a>).<p>- Laying on of hands symbolizes the visible transfer of leadership, echoed later when Moses &#8220;laid his hands on him and commissioned him&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>).<p>- Similar moments appear with Jacob blessing Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>) and with the early church sending out workers (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>). Each instance shows God working through human touch to affirm His chosen servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some of your authority</b><p>- God does not strip Moses of all authority; instead He shares a measured portion with Joshua. Moses will still lead until his death, but Joshua begins to stand beside him.<p>- Delegation protects continuity. When Moses ascends Mount Nebo (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1&#8211;5</a>), Israel will not be leaderless because authority has already been extended.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> underscores the result: &#8220;Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him.&#8221;<p>- This balance of shared authority also pictures Christ&#8217;s delegation to the apostles in <a href="/luke/9-1.htm">Luke 9:1</a>: &#8220;He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that</b><p>- God states the purpose outright. The transfer is not ceremonial fluff; it is functional, &#8220;so that&#8221; Israel will recognize Joshua&#8217;s God-given right to lead.<p>- Purpose clauses like this appear elsewhere: &#8220;So that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>). Each one explains why an action is necessary for God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The whole congregation of Israel</b><p>- No tribe or clan is exempt. From elders (<a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>) to ordinary families (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>), everyone must acknowledge Joshua.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a> shows Moses addressing &#8220;all Israel&#8221; as he installs Joshua: this leadership transition touches every household, ensuring national unity.<p>- The phrase also protects against factionalism later recorded in <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10&#8211;11</a>; obeying God&#8217;s appointed leader guards against each person &#8220;doing what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will obey him</b><p>- Obedience to Joshua equals obedience to God, since God Himself appoints Joshua (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18</a>). The chain of command is clear.<p>- The people keep this pledge in <a href="/joshua/1-16.htm">Joshua 1:16&#8211;17</a>: &#8220;Everything you have commanded us we will do&#8230; just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> extends the principle: &#8220;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls,&#8221; reminding believers that God-given authority still matters today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-20.htm">Numbers 27:20</a> teaches that leadership transition in God&#8217;s community is intentional, visible, and tied to divine authority. By laying hands on Joshua, Moses publicly shares his God-given authority so the entire nation will recognize and obey the new leader. The passage stresses continuity, unity, and obedience&#8212;showing that when God appoints a servant, His people are called to follow with the same seriousness they gave the previous shepherd.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put some of thine honour upon him,</span> or, "some of thy dignity" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>).
