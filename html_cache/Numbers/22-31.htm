In biblical context, God often opens eyes to reveal His will or presence, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a> when Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the heavenly army. This act signifies God's sovereignty and control over human perception and understanding.<p><b>and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often considered a theophany, or a manifestation of God Himself. This appearance emphasizes the seriousness of Balaam's mission and God's direct involvement. The road symbolizes Balaam's journey, both physically and spiritually, highlighting the divine intervention in his path.<p><b>with a drawn sword in his hand</b><br>A drawn sword is a symbol of impending judgment or divine authority. This imagery is used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>, where the commander of the LORD's army appears with a drawn sword. It signifies readiness for battle or judgment, underscoring the gravity of Balaam's situation and the potential consequences of his actions.<p><b>And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown</b><br>Balaam's response of bowing and falling facedown is an act of reverence and submission, common in biblical encounters with the divine (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). This posture indicates recognition of the angel's authority and Balaam's acknowledgment of his own position before God.

That points to a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ.<p>&#8226; Balaam had been negotiating a path of compromise; now he sees the holy One personally blocking his way.<p>&#8226; The road symbolizes the direction of life.
