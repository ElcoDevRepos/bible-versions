It welds together two scenes:<p>&#8226; Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters have presented their plea for inheritance, and Moses has laid the matter before the LORD (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Now, without delay or detour, God speaks.<p>The conjunction teaches that prayer and divine response belong in the same sentence. Scripture shows this rhythm repeatedly: &#8220;Then you will call, and the LORD will answer&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>); &#8220;Before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will hear&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>). The flow reminds us that:<p>- God&#8217;s ears are never closed to His people (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>- Confidence in prayer rests on His promised attentiveness (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD</b><p>The responder is &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; the covenant name Yahweh&#8212;eternally faithful, unchanging, and sovereign. By using His personal name, the text underscores:<p>- His covenant commitment. He has pledged Himself to Abraham&#8217;s offspring and will act in their interest (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p>- His unique authority as Lawgiver (<a href="/james/4-12.htm">James 4:12</a>). When God speaks, the matter is settled.<p>- His compassion. &#8220;For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords&#8230;who shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>). Giving rightful inheritance to these women reflects that impartial justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>answered</b><p>God &#8220;answered,&#8221; not merely acknowledged.
