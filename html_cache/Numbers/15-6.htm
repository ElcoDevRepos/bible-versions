It was often used in burnt offerings and peace offerings, symbolizing strength and leadership. The ram's use in sacrifices can be seen in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where Abraham offers a ram in place of Isaac, foreshadowing Christ as the substitutionary sacrifice.<p><b>you are to prepare a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute to God, symbolizing the dedication of the fruits of human labor. It was an acknowledgment of God's provision and a gesture of thanksgiving. This offering was non-bloody, contrasting with animal sacrifices, and it pointed to the purity and sinlessness of Christ, the Bread of Life.<p><b>of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour</b><br>An ephah was a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. Two-tenths of an ephah would be a significant amount, indicating the importance of the offering. Fine flour represents purity and refinement, symbolizing the sinless nature of Christ and the sanctification of believers.<p><b>mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil</b><br>A hin was a unit of liquid measure, approximately 3.7 liters or about 1 gallon. Olive oil was a staple in ancient Israel, used for anointing, cooking, and lighting lamps. In offerings, it symbolized the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration. The mixing of oil with flour in the grain offering signifies the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers, empowering and sanctifying them for service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and commandments from God, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for offerings as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who established the sacrificial system as a means for His people to maintain a right relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were journeying towards and where they were to implement these laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices instituted by God for the Israelites, which included burnt offerings, peace offerings, and others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifices.htm">Understanding Sacrifices</a></b><br>The sacrificial system was a means for the Israelites to express devotion, gratitude, and repentance.
