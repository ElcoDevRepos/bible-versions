The large number indicates the scale of the conflict and the significant impact on the Midianite population. In the ancient Near Eastern context, capturing women and children was a common practice in warfare, often for servitude or integration into the victors' society. The number 32,000 also reflects the thoroughness of the Israelite campaign, as commanded by God, to eliminate the influence of Midian, which had led Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25).<p><b>who had not slept with a man</b><br>This specification highlights the focus on preserving the purity of the captives. In the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, virginity was highly valued, and these women were considered ritually pure. This distinction was important for maintaining the holiness of the Israelite camp, as sexual immorality had previously led to a plague among the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25:1-9</a>). The preservation of virgins also ensured that the captives could be integrated into Israelite society without the complications of previous marital ties or allegiances. This practice can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament emphasis on spiritual purity and the Church as the bride of Christ, unblemished and set apart (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was commanded by God to take vengeance on the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that opposed Israel and led them into idolatry and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were instructed to carry out God's judgment against the Midianites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/3/32,000_women.htm">32,000 Women</a></b><br>The number of young women who were spared during the conquest, as they had not been involved in the immorality that led to the judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites were encamped and from where they launched their campaign against the Midianites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God's command to spare the young women highlights His justice in punishing sin while also showing mercy to the innocent.

The virgins were no exception; their lives and futures were now under Israelite protection and covenant influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why were the young women spared?</b><p>- Moral cause: These girls had not participated in Midian&#8217;s seduction of Israel, so they bore no guilt in that sin (<a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6, 14</a>-15).<p>- Legal cause: God&#8217;s warfare statutes permitted the sparing of certain captives, especially women and children, when the nations lay outside Canaan proper (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13-14</a>).<p>- Covenant cause: By entering Israelite households, the girls could come under the knowledge of Yahweh, much like Rahab later did in <a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>. The Lord often folds foreigners into His people through providential rescue (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Implications for Israel&#8217;s holiness</b><p>- The strict separation from sexual sin guarded the nation&#8217;s unique calling (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>).<p>- Handling captives required ritual purification: &#8220;You, your captives, and everything you seized must remain outside the camp seven days&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-19.htm">Numbers 31:19-24</a>). This underscored that victory did not exempt Israel from purity laws.<p>- The census-like listing illustrates that every life, even among the defeated, falls under God&#8217;s sovereign oversight (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Christ-centered reflections</b><p>- The spared virgins hint at grace amid judgment: while sin receives its due wage (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>a), God preserves a remnant for life and future blessing (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>- Just as these girls were transferred from Midian&#8217;s doomed society into Israel&#8217;s covenant community, believers are &#8220;delivered from the domain of darkness and transferred to the kingdom of His beloved Son&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p>- The meticulous division of spoils anticipates the Lord Jesus distributing gifts to His people after His victory (<a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>), showing that conquest in Scripture often leads to generous provision for God&#8217;s household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35</a> records the count of 32,000 Midianite girls who had never slept with a man, set apart from those executed because they bore no complicity in Midian&#8217;s earlier corruption of Israel. Their preservation fulfilled divine warfare statutes, protected Israel&#8217;s holiness, and opened a path for these captives to know the covenant God. The verse therefore showcases God&#8217;s just judgment, His precise stewardship over every life and possession, and His persistent thread of mercy woven even through scenes of warfare.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and 32,000</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;na&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - md<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">women</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1448;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">slept with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2145.htm">Strong's 2145: </a> </span><span class="str2">Remembered, a male</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/31-35.htm">Numbers 31:35 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/31-35.htm">OT Law: Numbers 31:35 And thirty-two thousand persons in all (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/31-34.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 31:34"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:34" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/31-36.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 31:36"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:36" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
