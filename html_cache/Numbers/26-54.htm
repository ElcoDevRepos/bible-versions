The larger tribes, having more people, required more land to sustain their population. This principle of proportionality ensures that resources are allocated based on need and capacity. Historically, this allocation was crucial for maintaining social stability and economic viability within the tribes. The concept of inheritance here also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of spiritual inheritance, where believers receive blessings according to their faith and capacity to serve (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>and decrease it for a small one;</b><br>This phrase underscores the fairness in distribution, ensuring that smaller tribes receive a portion appropriate to their size. It highlights God's justice and care for all His people, regardless of their size or strength. This principle can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching that God provides for each according to their needs (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). It also reflects the idea that in God's kingdom, each person or group has a role and place, regardless of their earthly status or size.<p><b>each tribe is to receive its inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is central to the identity and future of the Israelite tribes. It signifies not only land but also the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This inheritance is a tangible sign of God's covenant faithfulness. In a broader theological context, it points to the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as co-heirs with Him (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The land inheritance is a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, symbolizing rest and blessing.<p><b>according to the number of those registered.</b><br>The registration refers to the census taken to determine the number of men eligible for military service, as recorded earlier in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>. This census was not only for military purposes but also for organizing the distribution of land. It reflects the importance of order and structure in God's plans. The registration process ensures that each tribe's inheritance is based on an accurate and fair assessment of its needs. This meticulous attention to detail in God's instructions highlights His sovereignty and the importance of obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the census and the distribution of the land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>The priest who assists Moses in the census and the allocation of the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being counted and prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The twelve tribes, each descending from one of the sons of Jacob, who are to receive portions of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty in Provision</a></b><br>God determines the inheritance of each tribe, reflecting His sovereign will and provision for His people.

In the second wilderness census (<a href="/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1&#8211;51</a>), some tribes&#8212;such as Judah (76,500) and Joseph&#8217;s two halves, Ephraim and Manasseh (totaling 85,200)&#8212;had far more fighting-age men than others.<p>&#8226; God instructs Moses that land distribution must match that reality: &#8220;Increase the inheritance for a large tribe&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not favoritism but proportional stewardship: the families who will cultivate, defend, and develop a larger area should receive a larger portion (compare <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14&#8211;18</a>, where Joseph&#8217;s descendants request more territory because of their numbers).<p>&#8226; Cross references highlight the same principle of proportional blessing: <a href="/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a> speaks of God multiplying Israel &#8220;a thousand times over,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a> prays, &#8220;May the Lord add to you, both you and your children.&#8221; Bigger families naturally need broader provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and decrease it for a small one</b><p>&#8226; Conversely, tribes like Simeon (22,200) or Benjamin (45,600) required less territory.<p>&#8226; Limiting their allotment preserved equity, preventing waste and avoiding jealousy between tribes (see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>, where Asher is blessed with abundance suited to his size).<p>&#8226; The guideline also curbs greed: smaller tribes were not to grasp beyond their capacity, echoing <a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8&#8211;9</a>, &#8220;Give me neither poverty nor riches&#8230; lest I be full and deny You.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In practice, <a href="/bsb/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a> shows smaller inheritances given to smaller tribes, confirming God&#8217;s timeless wisdom in matching provision to responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each tribe is to receive its inheritance</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;inheritance&#8221; underscores that the land is a gift, not a conquest prize (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>, &#8220;The land is Mine, and you are but foreigners and sojourners with Me&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Every tribe&#8212;regardless of size&#8212;receives an irrevocable portion, assuring them of belonging and security (<a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13&#8211;14</a> repeats the promise even for Israel&#8217;s future restoration).<p>&#8226; This collective ownership knits the nation together; no tribe is left landless or dependent on another (compare <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>, where only the Levites receive no territorial inheritance because the Lord Himself is theirs).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the number of those registered</b><p>&#8226; The census list serves as an objective, public record, eliminating guesswork or favoritism (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2&#8211;3</a> shows the same counting method at Sinai).<p>&#8226; Registration ties inheritance to covenant responsibility: those counted are able-bodied men ready to defend the land God entrusts to them (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13&#8211;14</a> echoes the link between family defense and assigned land sections).<p>&#8226; By grounding distribution &#8220;according to the number,&#8221; the Lord affirms both His justice and His knowledge of each family&#8217;s needs, fulfilling <a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>, &#8220;Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> teaches that God&#8217;s allocation of the Promised Land is both generous and just: larger tribes receive more, smaller tribes receive less, yet every tribe receives a divinely guaranteed inheritance precisely suited to its size. The verse showcases God&#8217;s orderly provision, His care for every family, and His expectation that blessings match responsibilities&#8212;a pattern still relevant for faithful stewardship today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/26-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Increase</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(tar&#183;beh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1514;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
