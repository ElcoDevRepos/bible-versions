The concept of a "covenant" in biblical terms is a solemn agreement or promise made by God, often involving specific commitments and blessings. The "permanent priesthood" indicates a lasting and enduring role for Phinehas and his lineage in serving as priests. This covenant is significant because it underscores the importance of faithfulness and zeal for God in maintaining a special relationship with Him. The priesthood was a central institution in Israelite society, responsible for mediating between God and the people, offering sacrifices, and maintaining the holiness of the community. This promise to Phinehas is a continuation of the Aaronic priesthood, ensuring that his descendants would have a perpetual role in this sacred duty.<p><b>because he was zealous for his God</b><br>Phinehas's zeal is highlighted as the reason for this covenant. His actions in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, where he took decisive steps to stop the sin of idolatry and immorality among the Israelites, demonstrated his fervent commitment to God's holiness and commands. This zeal is reminiscent of other biblical figures who showed a passionate dedication to God, such as Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>) and Jesus cleansing the temple (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>). Zeal for God is often associated with a righteous indignation against sin and a desire to uphold God's honor and laws. Phinehas's actions were not just about anger but were motivated by a deep love for God and a desire to see His people live in obedience.<p><b>and made atonement for the Israelites.</b><br>Atonement involves making amends or reparation for sin, restoring the relationship between God and His people. Phinehas's act of zeal effectively turned away God's wrath from the Israelites, who were being punished for their sin with a plague. This act of atonement is a foreshadowing of the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who through His sacrifice on the cross, reconciled humanity to God (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). In the Old Testament, atonement was often achieved through sacrifices and the shedding of blood, pointing to the necessity of a mediator between God and man. Phinehas's intervention highlights the role of the priest as an intercessor, a role that finds its fulfillment in Christ, the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The grandson of Aaron, the high priest, and son of Eleazar.
