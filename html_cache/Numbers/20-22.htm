It was here that Moses struck the rock to bring forth water, an act that led to his being barred from entering the Promised Land. Kadesh is often associated with testing and rebellion, as it was the site of the Israelites' refusal to enter Canaan due to fear of the inhabitants. This phrase marks a transition from a place of disobedience and judgment to a new phase in their journey.<p><b>the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and collective movement of the Israelites. The term "congregation" suggests a formal assembly, highlighting the organized nature of the Israelite community. It reflects the communal aspect of their covenant relationship with God, where the actions and decisions of the group as a whole had significant spiritual implications.<p><b>came to Mount Hor</b><br>Mount Hor is traditionally identified with a mountain in the region of Edom, near the border of the Promised Land. It is significant as the place where Aaron, the brother of Moses and the first high priest, died and was buried. This event marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing the end of an era and the transition of priestly leadership. The location of Mount Hor also underscores the Israelites' proximity to the fulfillment of God's promise, as they were nearing the land of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh.htm">Kadesh</a></b><br>A significant location in the wilderness journey of the Israelites.

The verse quietly assures that, despite past sin and present transitions, the Lord steadily advances His people toward every promise He has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And the children of Israel . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto Mount Hor. </span>The insertion of the words "the whole congregation," as in <a href="/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>, probably denotes that the people were broken up and dispersed during a considerable portion of their wilderness life, and that it was only on particular occasions that they were gathered together.<p><span class= "bld">And came unto Mount Hor.--</span>It cannot be inferred from this statement that Mount Hor, near Petra, the modern Har-n (see Stanley's "Sinai and Palestine," p. 86), was only one day's journey from Kadesh. It is evident from <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm" title="And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.">Numbers 10:33</a> that the places of encampment may have been distant from each other several days' journey.

If the narrative follows the order of time, we must suppose that the Edomites at once blocked the passes near to Kadesh, and thus compelled the Israelites to journey southwards for some distance until they were clear of the Azazimat; they would then turn eastwards again and make their way across the plateau of Paran to the Arabah at a point <span class="accented">opposite</span> Mount Hen It is supposed by many, although it finds no support in the narrative itself, that the armed resistance offered by Edom is out of chronological order in verse 20, and only occurred in fact when the Israelites had reached the neighbourhood of Mount Her, and were preparing to ascend the Wady Ghuweir. On the name of Mount Her (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) see on Numbers 34:7, 8. There can be no doubt that tradition is right in identifying it with the Jebel Harun (mount of Aaron), a lofty and precipitous mountain rising between the Arabah and the site of Petra. On one of its two summits the tomb of Aaron is still shown, and although this is itself worthless as evidence, yet the character and position of the mountain are altogether in agreement with the legend. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/20-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After they had set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
