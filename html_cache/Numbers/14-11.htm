In the context of the Pentateuch, Moses often intercedes on behalf of the people, reflecting his leadership and prophetic role. This communication underscores the personal relationship God had with Moses, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face.<p><b>How long will this people treat Me with contempt?</b><br>The term "contempt" here refers to the Israelites' repeated disobedience and lack of trust in God, despite His continuous provision and guidance. This reflects a pattern of behavior seen throughout the wilderness journey, where the Israelites frequently complained and rebelled against God's commands. The question "How long" suggests God's patience and long-suffering nature, yet also His justice and righteousness, as seen in similar expressions of divine frustration in <a href="/exodus/16-28.htm">Exodus 16:28</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>.<p><b>How long will they refuse to believe in Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the core issue of unbelief, which is a recurring theme in the Israelites' journey. Despite witnessing God's miraculous works, the people struggled with faith. This unbelief is not just a lack of trust but a willful rejection of God's promises and power. <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a> reflects on this unbelief as the reason the Israelites could not enter the Promised Land, serving as a warning to future generations.<p><b>despite all the signs I have performed among them?</b><br>The "signs" refer to the miraculous events God performed, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna and quail. These signs were meant to demonstrate God's power and faithfulness. The Israelites' failure to trust God despite these signs is a testament to the hardness of their hearts. This mirrors the New Testament accounts where Jesus performed signs and wonders, yet many still did not believe, as seen in <a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>. The signs serve as both a testament to God's power and a test of the people's faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and led them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt but frequently doubted and disobeyed God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_paran.htm">The Wilderness of Paran</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites camped and from where the spies were sent to explore the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_signs_and_wonders.htm">The Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by God, including the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and provision in the wilderness, intended to demonstrate His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unbelief.htm">The Danger of Unbelief</a></b><br>Unbelief is not just a lack of faith but an active rejection of God's revealed truth and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_faithfulness.htm">Remembering God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on past experiences of God's faithfulness to strengthen your trust in Him during current challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_contempt.htm">The Consequences of Contempt</a></b><br>Treating God with contempt by doubting His promises can lead to missed blessings and opportunities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God is a demonstration of faith and trust in His character and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_justice.htm">God's Patience and Justice</a></b><br>While God is patient, persistent unbelief and rebellion can lead to His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_14_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 14:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/God_s_reaction_to_Israel_s_disbelief.htm">How does Numbers 14:11 reveal God's response to Israel's lack of faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Divine_patience_justice_in_Num_14_11.htm">What does God's question in Numbers 14:11 teach about divine patience and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_not_repeat_Israelites_error_today.htm">How can we avoid the Israelites' mistake of "despising" God's signs today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_NT_passages_echo_Numbers_14_11.htm">What New Testament passages echo the themes found in Numbers 14:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_faith_and_avoid_sin.htm">How can we strengthen our faith to prevent provoking God like Israel did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Israelites_doubt_after_miracles_2.htm">Why did the Israelites repeatedly doubt God despite witnessing miracles in Numbers 14:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_14_11_show_human_doubt.htm">How does Numbers 14:11 reflect human nature's tendency to doubt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Num_14_11_show_about_God_s_faith.htm">What does Numbers 14:11 reveal about God's expectations of faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_threaten_israel_if_moses_would_intercede.htm">In Numbers 14:11&#8211;12, why would God threaten to destroy the Israelites if He already knew Moses would intercede successfully?
