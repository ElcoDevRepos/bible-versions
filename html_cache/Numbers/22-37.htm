Balaam's reputation as a seer was well-known, and Balak sought his services to curse the Israelites. This interaction highlights the tension between the Moabites and the Israelites as the latter approached the Promised Land. Balaam's role as a prophet outside of Israel demonstrates God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>Did I not send you an urgent summons?</b><br>Balak's urgency reflects the fear and desperation of the Moabites as they faced the encroaching Israelites. The Moabites had heard of Israel's victories over other nations, and Balak believed that a curse from Balaam could turn the tide. This urgency underscores the spiritual warfare aspect of the narrative, where Balak seeks supernatural intervention against God's people. It also highlights the ancient Near Eastern practice of employing divination and curses in warfare.<p><b>Why did you not come to me?</b><br>Balak's question reveals his frustration and impatience. Balaam's initial hesitation to come was due to God's intervention, as God instructed Balaam not to curse the Israelites because they were blessed. This delay emphasizes the theme of divine control over human plans. It also sets the stage for Balaam's eventual journey, which is marked by divine encounters, including the famous incident with the talking donkey, illustrating God's direct involvement in the events.<p><b>Am I really not able to reward you richly?</b><br>Balak's offer of a rich reward indicates the high value placed on Balaam's services. In the ancient world, prophets and diviners were often compensated handsomely for their abilities to influence spiritual realms. This phrase also highlights the materialistic motivations that can drive human actions, contrasting with the divine mandate that Balaam ultimately must follow. The mention of reward foreshadows Balaam's internal conflict between obeying God and seeking personal gain, a theme that resonates with the New Testament warnings against the love of money and false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to hire Balaam to curse them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner known for his ability to bless or curse, summoned by Balak.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, where the Israelites were encamped.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whose presence and victories cause fear among the Moabites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/summons.htm">Summons</a></b><br>The urgent call sent by Balak to Balaam, highlighting the desperation and fear of Balak.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, God&#8217;s will prevails.
