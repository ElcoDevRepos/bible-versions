The law provided a way to determine her innocence or guilt. The term "defiled" indicates a breach of marital fidelity, which was a serious offense in ancient Israelite society. The concept of being "clean" is significant in the Levitical laws, often associated with ritual purity and moral integrity. This reflects the importance of holiness and purity in the covenant relationship between God and His people. The process underscores the seriousness of marital vows and the sanctity of marriage, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>she will be unaffected</b><br>This phrase indicates that if the woman is innocent, the ritual will have no harmful effects on her. The ordeal was designed to reveal the truth without human intervention, relying on divine judgment. The absence of any adverse effects would serve as a public vindication of her character. This reflects the biblical principle that God is a just judge who protects the innocent (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). It also highlights the theme of divine justice, where God Himself intervenes to uphold righteousness.<p><b>and able to conceive children</b><br>In ancient Israel, childbearing was considered a blessing and a sign of God's favor (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). Infertility, on the other hand, was often seen as a curse or a sign of divine displeasure. The ability to conceive after the ordeal would not only vindicate the woman but also restore her honor and status within the community. This promise of fertility can be seen as a type of restoration and blessing, akin to the restoration offered through Christ, who brings spiritual fruitfulness to those who are in Him (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). The emphasis on childbearing also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Central to this verse, she is the subject of the test for adultery described in <a href="/bsb/numbers/5.htm">Numbers 5</a>.
