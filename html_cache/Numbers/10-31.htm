This plea highlights the importance of community and guidance in the journey of the Israelites. It reflects the human need for companionship and support, even when divine guidance is available. The request underscores the value of wisdom and experience that Hobab possesses, which Moses recognizes as beneficial for the journey ahead.<p><b>Moses said,</b><br>Moses, as the leader of the Israelites, often acts as the intermediary between God and the people.

This phrase indicates the practical wisdom and experience that Hobab brings, which is essential for survival and success in the harsh conditions of the desert. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God using human means and relationships to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and you can serve as our eyes.</b><br>This metaphor emphasizes the role of guidance and insight that Hobab can provide. In a spiritual sense, it can be seen as a type of Christ, who is often referred to as the light and guide for believers.

The verse teaches that divine guidance and responsible human cooperation go hand in hand, affirming the importance of faithful friends who help God&#8217;s people navigate both the physical and spiritual wilderness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">How we are to encamp . . . --</span>It is clear from these words, as well as from many indications of the same nature, that notwithstanding the direct guidance which was vouchsafed from heaven, and the miraculous interpositions of Providence which the Israelites experienced throughout their journeys, Moses did not neglect to take advantage of all the ordinary precautions of which it was incumbent upon him as the leader of his people to avail himself. The line of march and the places of encampment were clearly marked out by the cloud, but many difficulties would arise in the course of the journeys, and at the places of encampment, which Hobab's familiarity with the desert would enable him to meet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.</span> It is an obvious conclusion, from the reasons here urged by Moses, that the many and wonderful promises of Divine guidance and Divine direction did <span class="accented">not</span> supersede in his eyes the use of all available human aids. It is not indeed easy to say <span class="accented">where</span> any room was left for the good <span class="accented">offices</span> and experience of Hobab; the cloud of the Divine Presence <span class="accented">seemed</span> to control absolutely the journeying and encamping of the people; yet if we really knew in detail the actual ordering of that wondrous march, we should doubtless find that the heavenly guidance did but give unity and certainty to all the wisdom, caution, and endeavour of its earthly leaders. Indeed if we recall to mind that the host is calculated at more than two millions of people, it is quite evident that even during the march to Kadesh (and much more in the long wanderings which followed) it must have been extremely difficult to keep the various divisions together. In the broken and difficult country which they were to traverse, which had been familiar to Hobab from his youth, there would be scope enough for all his ability as a guide. And it would seem that it was just this prospect of being really useful to the people of Israel that prevailed with Hobab. He must indeed have felt assured that a wonderful future awaited a nation whose past and present were, even within his own knowledge, so wonderful. But that alone could not move him to leave his own land and his own kindred, a firing so unspeakably repugnant to the feelings and traditions of his age and country. Doubtless to the child of the desert, whose life was a never-ending struggle with the dangers and vicissitudes of the wilderness, the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, watered with the rain of heaven, seemed like the garden of Eden. Yet the offer of an heritage within that land moved him not so much, it would appear, as the claim upon his own good offices in helping the chosen people to reach their own abode. The Septuagint translation, or rather paraphrase, of this verse is, "Leave us not, forasmuch as thou wast with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us." This seems, on the one hand, to identify Hobab with Jethro; on the other, to imply that he was shortly afterwards one of the seventy elders upon whom the spirit came. This, however, is not likely. Hobab does indeed seem to have gone with the people, but his descendants were not incorporated into Israel; they were with them, but not of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/10-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">leave us,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5800.htm">Strong's 5800: </a> </span><span class="str2">To loosen, relinquish, permit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
