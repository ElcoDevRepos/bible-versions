The suddenness emphasizes the involuntary nature of the defilement, highlighting the importance of maintaining purity, especially for those under a Nazirite vow. The presence of death was a significant concern in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>, where priests were given specific instructions to avoid contact with the dead to maintain their holiness.<p><b>and defiles his consecrated head of hair</b><br>The Nazirite vow, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>, included letting one's hair grow as a symbol of dedication to God. The hair was a visible sign of the vow and its consecration. Defilement of the hair through contact with death required specific actions to restore purity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and dedication to God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, where believers are called to be separate from unclean things.<p><b>he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing</b><br>Shaving the head was a symbolic act of purification and renewal. It marked the end of the defilement period and the beginning of a new consecration. This act of shaving is reminiscent of other purification rituals in the Old Testament, such as those for lepers in <a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>, where shaving was part of the cleansing process. It signifies a fresh start and a return to a state of holiness.<p><b>the seventh day</b><br>The seventh day holds significant biblical symbolism, often representing completion and perfection, as seen in the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>. In the context of the Nazirite vow, the seventh day marks the completion of the cleansing process, allowing the individual to resume their vow. This reflects the broader biblical principle of rest and restoration, as seen in the Sabbath commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, where the seventh day is set apart for rest and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who has taken a vow of separation to the Lord, characterized by abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sudden_death.htm">Sudden Death</a></b><br>An unexpected event that causes defilement for the Nazirite, interrupting their vow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecrated_head.htm">Consecrated Head</a></b><br>Refers to the Nazirite's hair, which is a symbol of their vow and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_day.htm">Seventh Day</a></b><br>The day of cleansing, significant in Jewish law as a time of purification and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaving_of_the_head.htm">Shaving of the Head</a></b><br>A ritual act of purification and renewal of the Nazirite vow after defilement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow underscores the importance of living a life set apart for God.

Even priests had to avoid corpses, except for close relatives (<a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>), underscoring how death symbolizes the consequence of sin (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The Nazirite&#8217;s vow was voluntary, but its holiness was not negotiable; accidental defilement mattered to God just as deliberate sin does (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and defiles his consecrated head of hair</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;and defiles his consecrated head of hair&#8230;.&#8221; The hair was the visible sign of the vow (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Consecrated&#8221; means set apart exclusively for God; nothing common could touch it. Comparable dedication marks the priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>) and the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>).<p>&#8226; When the undefiled sign becomes tainted, the whole vow is compromised&#8212;illustrated in Samson&#8217;s life when Delilah had his locks cut (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle carries forward: believers&#8217; bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit; what defiles the body affects one&#8217;s testimony (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must shave his head</b><p>Because the symbol was ruined, &#8220;he must shave his head&#8230;.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shaving starts the vow over from zero, acknowledging lost time (<a href="/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar resets appear in cleansing rituals for lepers (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>) and for those purified from bodily discharges (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a>). Each rite underscores that holiness is restored only on God&#8217;s terms.<p>&#8226; Paul likely followed this regulation when he &#8220;had his hair cut off at Cenchreae, because of a vow he had taken&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the day of his cleansing&#8212;the seventh day</b><p>The timing matters: &#8220;on the day of his cleansing&#8212;the seventh day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The seven-day period mirrors <a href="/numbers/19-12.htm">Numbers 19:12</a>, where sprinkling water of purification occurs on the third and seventh days. Completion comes only after the full time God appoints.<p>&#8226; Seven often marks completion or perfection (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Here it seals the Nazarite&#8217;s restored purity, preparing him to resume his vow on the eighth day with sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/6-10.htm">Numbers 6:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Cleansing always culminates in worship; the process leads the worshiper back into fellowship, not merely back to neutrality (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9</a> shows God&#8217;s meticulous care for holiness even in accidental situations.

Wait God&#8217;s appointed seven days for full cleansing.<p>The verse teaches that holiness is precious, defilement is serious, and restoration is always possible through obedience to God&#8217;s clear instructions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">If any man die very suddenly by him.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, in his presence, or neighbourhood, so that, having hastened to his assistance, lie found himself in contact with a corpse.
