This tribe was known for its maritime activities, as suggested in <a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>, where Jacob prophesies that Zebulun will "live by the seashore and become a haven for ships." The tribe's territory was located in the northern part of Israel, which included fertile land conducive to agriculture and trade. Zebulun's role in the census highlights its importance in the military and social structure of Israel.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization into clans and families reflects the tribal structure of ancient Israel, which was patriarchal and kinship-based. This structure was crucial for maintaining order and identity among the Israelites. The records were likely kept meticulously, as seen in other parts of the Pentateuch, to ensure accurate representation and accountability. This system also underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society.<p><b>Counting the names of all those</b><br>The act of counting names indicates a formal census, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures for administrative and military purposes. This census was commanded by God to Moses and Aaron, emphasizing divine order and preparation for the Israelites' journey and conquest of the Promised Land. It also reflects the importance of each individual within the community, as each name counted contributed to the collective strength of the nation.<p><b>Twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was considered the age of maturity and responsibility in Israelite culture, particularly for military service. This age requirement aligns with other ancient cultures where young men were expected to be ready for battle. It signifies the readiness and capability of the individuals to contribute to the defense and expansion of the nation.<p><b>Who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite society, especially during the wilderness period and the subsequent conquest of Canaan. The ability to serve in the army was not only a duty but also a sign of one's commitment to the community and to God's covenant promises. This phrase highlights the practical need for defense and the theological aspect of fulfilling God's promises to Abraham regarding the land. The military organization also foreshadows the spiritual battles faced by believers, drawing a parallel to the New Testament's call to be soldiers of Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_zebulun.htm">Sons of Zebulun</a></b><br>Descendants of Zebulun, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, representing one of the tribes of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/genealogies.htm">Genealogies</a></b><br>The record of lineage and family history, crucial for establishing tribal identity and inheritance rights.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/clans_and_families.htm">Clans and Families</a></b><br>Subdivisions within the tribe, indicating the importance of family structure in Israelite society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/army_registration.htm">Army Registration</a></b><br>The census was conducted to determine the number of men eligible for military service, reflecting the need for defense and organization.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_zebulun.htm">Tribe of Zebulun</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its later role in providing warriors and its territory in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_identity_and_heritage.htm">Importance of Identity and Heritage</a></b><br>Understanding one's spiritual heritage is crucial.

It parallels New Testament teaching that believers must grow into &#8220;the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>), moving from childhood to mature service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who could serve in the army</b><p>The census purpose was military preparedness.<p>&#8226;
