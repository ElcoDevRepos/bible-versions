This census is part of God's command to consecrate the firstborn to Him (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). The firstborn males represent the beginning of strength and the future of the family line, which holds cultural importance in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>a month old or more</b><br>The specification of "a month old or more" indicates the age at which a male child was considered viable and thus counted. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, infant mortality was high, and a child surviving past the first month was more likely to live. This age threshold also aligns with the time when a child would be presented for redemption, as seen in the practice of redeeming the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13-15</a>).<p><b>listed by name</b><br>The listing by name underscores the personal nature of God's relationship with His people.

This number also sets the stage for the redemption of the firstborn, as the Levites are taken in place of the firstborn of Israel (<a href="/numbers/3-45.htm">Numbers 3:45-47</a>). The slight discrepancy between the number of firstborn and the number of Levites (22,000) necessitates a redemption price for the excess, pointing to the concept of substitution and redemption, which foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was responsible for conducting the census of the firstborn males as commanded by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest, who played a significant role in the religious leadership of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were now in the wilderness, receiving God's laws and instructions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_firstborn_males.htm">The Firstborn Males</a></b><br>These were the firstborn sons of the Israelites, who were counted in this census as part of God's command to consecrate the firstborn to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart by God to serve in the tabernacle, who were to be taken in place of the firstborn sons of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_consecration.htm">The Principle of Consecration</a></b><br>The firstborn males were consecrated to God, symbolizing that all life belongs to Him.

It might suffice, in answer to those who urge this difficulty as a ground for rejecting the truth of the narrative, to reply that it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive that a writer who has recorded, or, according to the theory in question, <span class= "ital">invented </span>so many complicated calculations, should have inserted amongst them one which is fraught with so much apparent improbability. Many solutions of the problem have been proposed which relieve the apparent disproportion of the number of the firstborn not only of its alleged impossibility, but even of improbability. Some have urged that we are constrained by every principle of analogy to restrict the firstborn sons to those who were under twenty years of age, and who had not been included in the census which had been already taken. The destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians was clearly subject to a somewhat similar limitation. Pharaoh himself was, in all probability, a firstborn son; and in regard to the Egyptians generally there does not appear to have been above one death in each house (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm" title="And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.">Exodus 12:30</a>), although there must have been very many houses in which the father (and it may be the grandfather) as well as the son was a firstborn child. Another opinion is that by the firstborn in every <span class= "ital">family </span>we are to understand the firstborn in every <span class= "ital">household, </span>including the children of concubines and slaves. When due allowance has been made, on either of these hypotheses, for the average proportion of the sexes, the average number of early deaths, and also for the limitation of the term <span class= "ital">firstborn </span>to those who were the firstborn on the side of the father as well as of the mother, it has been contended that the number of the firstborn is consistent with the supposition that each family of the Israelites consisted of about eight or nine children--a supposition which, considering how prolific the Hebrew women are said to have been, cannot be regarded as deserving of rejection on the ground of its incredibility. The most probable solution of the difficulty, however, appears to be that which is given in the Introduction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.</span> These were the first-born of the twelve tribes; but who were included under the designation "first-born" is a matter of grave dispute. The smallness of their number (not much above one per cent. of the whole population) has given rise to several conflicting theories, all of which seem to be artificial, arbitrary, and therefore unsatisfactory. It is urged by some that the expression "every male that openeth the womb" must be strictly pressed, and that there would be no "first-born" in those families (which form a considerable majority) in which either a girl was born first, or the eldest, being a boy, had died. It is further urged that only those first-horn would be counted who were not themselves fathers of families. These considerations will indeed reduce the probable numbers very largely, but not to the required amount. Others, again, give an entirely different turn to the difficulty by urging that as the command in <a href="/exodus/13.htm">Exodus 13</a>. I was prospective only, so at this time only the first-born since the exodus were counted. This makes it necessary to assume an altogether unprecedented birth-rate during that short period. One other explanation strives to satisfy the arithmetical conditions of the problem by assuming that the whole of the Divine legislation in this matter was in reality directed against the worship of Moloch, and was designed to prevent the offering of first-born to him by redeeming them unto himself. As the rites of Moloch only demanded young children of tender age, only such were counted in this census. It may, indeed, be very probably concluded that their heavenly Father <span class="accented">did</span> claim these first-born, partly in order to save them from Moloch, because the people would thereafter be exposed to the fascination of that horrid superstition; but there is no proof whatever that they were acquainted with it at this time. These cruel rites, together with many other heathen abominations, are forbidden in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, in view of the entry into Canaan, where they were practiced. The prophet Amos, when he reproaches them with having "carried the tabernacle of" their "Moloch" even in the wilderness (<a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>), absolves them by implication from any darker superstition; and the highly rhetorical passage <a href="/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a> seems to refer to the consequences of disobedience at a later date, and can hardly be pressed against the entire silence of the Pentateuch. Anyhow it does not seem possible, on the strength of a supposed intention on the part of God of which no trace appears in the text, to impose a narrow and arbitrary limit upon the plain command to number "all the first-born, from a month old and upward." If we turn from these speculations to the reason and ground of the matter as stated by God himself, it will appear much more simple. It was distinctly on the ground of their preservation from the destroying angel in Egypt that the first-born of Israel were claimed as God's <span class="accented">peculium</span> now (see verse 13). The command in <a href="/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1</a> was no doubt prospective, but the sanctification of the first-born was based upon the deliverance itself; and this command was intended not to limit that sanctification for the present, but to continue it for the future. Now if we turn to <a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29, 30</a>, and ask who the first-born were whom the destroying angel cut off, we see plainly enough that they included the eldest son, being a child, in every house; that every family lost one, and only one. On the one hand, Pharaoh himself was in all probability a first-born, but he was not in any personal danger, because he ranked and suffered as a father, not as a son. On the other hand, the majority of families in which the first-born was a daughter, or had died, did not therefore escape: "there was not a house where there was not one dead." Taking this as the only sure ground to go upon, we may conclude with some confidence that the first-born now claimed by God in-eluded all the eldest sons in the families of Israel who were not themselves the heads of houses. These were the destroyed in Egypt - these the redeemed in Israel. How they came to be so few in proportion is a matter in itself of extremely slight importance, and dependant, perhaps, upon causes of which no record was left. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/3-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The total</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">number</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
