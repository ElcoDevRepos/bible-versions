This reflects the hierarchical structure of their society, where Moses was seen as the appointed leader by God. The act of crying out indicates desperation and a recognition of Moses' unique relationship with God. This pattern of intercession is seen throughout the Pentateuch, where Moses frequently acts as an intermediary between God and the people (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>).<p><b>and he prayed to the LORD</b><br>Moses' immediate response to the people's plea was to pray, demonstrating his role as a prophet and intercessor. This highlights the importance of prayer in leadership and the power of intercession. Moses' prayers often resulted in God relenting from His anger, showcasing the effectiveness of righteous intercession (<a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>). This also prefigures Christ's role as the ultimate intercessor (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and the fire died down</b><br>The fire represents God's judgment and anger towards the people's complaints and disobedience. The cessation of the fire upon Moses' prayer signifies God's mercy and willingness to forgive when approached with genuine repentance and intercession. This event is a reminder of God's holiness and the consequences of sin, as well as His readiness to forgive (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). The fire dying down can also be seen as a type of Christ's atoning work, where through His intercession, the wrath of God is appeased.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.
