It was an important hub for trade and commerce during the time of the Israelites. The city is mentioned in connection with King Solomon's fleet (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>) and was known for its shipbuilding and trade expeditions. The departure from Ezion-geber marks a transition from a place of economic activity to a journey through the wilderness, symbolizing a shift from human enterprise to reliance on God's provision.<p><b>and camped at Kadesh</b><br>Kadesh, often referred to as Kadesh-barnea, was a major encampment for the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. It is located in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula. Kadesh holds significant historical and spiritual importance as it was the site where the Israelites faced a critical moment of disobedience and lack of faith, leading to their prolonged wandering (Numbers 13-14). It was also the place where Moses struck the rock to bring forth water, an act that led to his own exclusion from entering the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>). Kadesh serves as a reminder of both God's provision and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>in the Wilderness of Zin</b><br>The Wilderness of Zin is a desert region located in the southern part of modern-day Israel. It is characterized by its arid and harsh conditions, which tested the faith and endurance of the Israelites. The wilderness experience is often seen as a time of testing and purification, where God prepared His people for entry into the Promised Land. The Wilderness of Zin is also associated with the story of the twelve spies sent to scout the land of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>). This region serves as a backdrop for the Israelites' journey of faith and reliance on God, highlighting themes of trust, obedience, and divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezion-geber.htm">Ezion-geber</a></b><br>A port city located near the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba.

Israel had camped there after leaving the copper-rich mines of the Arabah, a place marked by trade and activity.<p>&#8226; Physically leaving a bustling seaport for the wilderness reminds us that God sometimes calls His people away from apparent security or opportunity so their trust rests on Him alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;They set out&#8221; keeps the narrative rhythm of obedience: whenever the cloud moved, Israel moved (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17-23</a>). Consistent responsiveness to God&#8217;s direction is part of covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and camped at Kadesh</b><p>&#8226; Kadesh (often called Kadesh-barnea) was a familiar, even bittersweet, stop. Earlier, from this very place, the twelve spies were sent into Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Forty years earlier, unbelief at Kadesh had postponed entry into the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-26.htm">Deuteronomy 1:26-36</a>).

Past failures did not cancel future mercies; the covenant promise endured (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The recurrence of the site invites reflection: God may return us to places of past testing so we can respond differently by faith (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11-13</a>; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Wilderness of Zin.</b><p>&#8226; Zin is the southern desert bordering Canaan.
