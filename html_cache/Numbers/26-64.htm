This census was crucial for organizing the tribes for the upcoming conquest of Canaan.<p><b>there was not one who had been numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest</b><br>This highlights the fulfillment of God's judgment on the previous generation.

This location is significant as it represents the starting point of Israel's journey after receiving the Law at Mount Sinai.
