This acknowledgment highlights God's sovereign choice of Israel as His chosen people, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). Balaam's realization underscores the futility of opposing God's will, as seen in other biblical narratives where God's plans prevail despite human intentions (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><b>he did not seek omens as on previous occasions</b><br>Previously, Balaam attempted to use divination to curse Israel, a practice condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>. His change in behavior indicates a recognition of God's authority and the ineffectiveness of pagan practices against God's purposes. This shift can be seen as a moment of clarity where Balaam acknowledges the supremacy of the God of Israel over other spiritual forces.<p><b>but he turned his face toward the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing and divine encounter in the Bible, as seen in Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16:1-36</a>). By turning toward the wilderness, Balaam aligns himself with God's perspective, preparing to deliver a message of blessing rather than curse. This act can be seen as a physical representation of a spiritual turning point, where Balaam submits to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel.
