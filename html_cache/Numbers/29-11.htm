The goat symbolizes the removal of sin and impurity from the community. In <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, the Day of Atonement ritual involves a scapegoat, which is sent into the wilderness, symbolizing the removal of Israel's sins. The use of a male goat here emphasizes the need for purification and atonement, pointing to the seriousness of sin and the necessity of a substitute to bear the penalty. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>In addition to the sin offering of atonement</b><br>The sin offering of atonement refers to the sacrifices made on the Day of Atonement, a significant annual event in the Jewish calendar. This day was the only time the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for the sins of the people. The additional sin offering mentioned here highlights the continuous need for atonement beyond the annual observance, underscoring the pervasive nature of sin. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that Christ's sacrifice was once for all, providing eternal redemption (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><b>And the regular burnt offering</b><br>The regular burnt offering was a daily sacrifice, made both morning and evening, as described in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>. It served as a continual reminder of the people's dedication to God and their need for His presence. The burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total surrender to God. This daily ritual points to the need for ongoing devotion and the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself completely for humanity's redemption (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>With its grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, often accompanying burnt offerings, consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (Leviticus 2). It represented the fruits of human labor and was an expression of thanksgiving and dedication to God. The inclusion of the grain offering signifies the importance of offering the best of one's resources to God, acknowledging His provision. This offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual sustenance to believers.<p><b>And drink offerings</b><br>Drink offerings, typically wine, were poured out at the base of the altar (<a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>). They symbolized the outpouring of one's life in service to God. The drink offering complements the burnt and grain offerings, completing the sacrificial ritual. In the New Testament, Paul refers to his life as being poured out like a drink offering (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>), illustrating the concept of sacrificial living. This imagery is fulfilled in Christ, who poured out His life unto death for the salvation of many (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these instructions to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement</a></b><br>A significant event in the Jewish calendar, a day dedicated to atonement and repentance, which is part of the context for this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice made to atone for sins, highlighting the need for purification and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The inclusion of a sin offering underscores the necessity of atonement for sin.
