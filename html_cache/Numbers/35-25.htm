The "manslayer" refers to someone who has killed another unintentionally, distinguishing them from a murderer. The "avenger of blood" was typically a close relative of the deceased, tasked with avenging the death. This system reflects the cultural importance of family honor and justice. The assembly's role was to protect the manslayer, ensuring that justice was tempered with mercy, aligning with God's laws that emphasize both justice and compassion (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>).<p><b>Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge to which he fled,</b><br>Cities of refuge were designated places where those who committed manslaughter could seek asylum. These cities were strategically located throughout Israel to be accessible to all (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7-9</a>). The concept underscores God's provision for justice and mercy, allowing time for emotions to settle and for a fair trial. The return to the city of refuge signifies the community's recognition of the manslayer's right to protection and due process.<p><b>and he must live there until the death of the high priest,</b><br>The high priest served as a spiritual leader and mediator between God and the people. His death marked a significant event, symbolizing a new beginning and the release of the manslayer from his obligation to remain in the city of refuge. This provision highlights the importance of the high priest's role in the community and the belief in a divinely ordained order. It also foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, whose death provides ultimate atonement and freedom from sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>who was anointed with the holy oil.</b><br>Anointing with holy oil set the high priest apart for sacred service, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's empowerment and God's blessing. This practice underscores the sanctity and authority of the high priest's office. The anointing oil, composed of specific ingredients (<a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>), was a physical representation of spiritual consecration. This anointing prefigures Christ, the Anointed One, who fulfills the roles of prophet, priest, and king, providing eternal refuge and intercession for believers (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manslayer.htm">Manslayer</a></b><br>An individual who has unintentionally killed another person.

The manslayer was, therefore, required to remain an exile from his own home until the death of the high priest who had been anointed with the holy oil. As the high priest, by reason of the anointing with the holy oil, became qualified to act as the representative of the nation, and in that capacity acted as their mediator on the great day of atonement, so the death of the high priest assumed a symbolical or representative character, and became a type of that of the great High Priest who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, and who by His death made a propitiation for the sins of the world. Thus, as by the death of the Jewish high priest a typical atonement was made for the sin of the Israelitish manslayer, and he was restored thereupon to "the land of his possession" amongst his brethren, so by the death of our High Priest they who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them, are restored to the inheritance which had been forfeited by sin, and made joint heirs with Christ of those mansions which He has gone before to prepare for those who love Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The congregation</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall restore him to the city of his refuge.</span> It is perfectly plain from this (and from <a href="/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>) that the general assembly of all Israel was to summon both homicide and avenger before them with their witnesses, and, if they found the accused innocent, were to send him back under safe escort to the city in which he had taken refuge. <span class="cmt_word">He shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest.</span> No doubt his family might join him in his exile, and his life might be fairly happy as well as safe within certain narrow limits; but under ordinary circumstances he must forfeit much and risk more by his enforced absence from home and land. It is not easy to see why the death of the high priest should have set the fugitive free from the law of vengeance, except as foreshadowing the death of Christ. No similar significance is anywhere else attributed to the death of the high priest; and it was rather in its unbroken continuance than in its recurring interruption that the priesthood of Aaron typified that of the Redeemer. To see anything of a vicarious or satisfactory character in the death of the high priest seems to be introducing an element quite foreign to the symbolism of the Old Testament. The stress, however, which is laid upon the fact of his decease (cf. verse 28), and the solemn notice of his having been anointed with the holy oil, seem to point unmistakably to something in his official and consecrated character which made it right that the rigour of the law should die with him. What the Jubilee was to the debtor who had lost his property, that the death of the high priest was to the homicide who had lost his liberty. If it was the case, as commonly believed, that all blood feuds were absolutely terminated by the death of the high priest, might this not be because the high priest, as chief minister of the law of God, was himself the goel of the whole nation? When he died all processes of' vengeance lapsed, because they had really been commenced in his name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The assembly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
