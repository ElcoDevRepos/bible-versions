The cries signify a moment of divine judgment and terror. In the broader biblical context, cries often symbolize distress and a call for help, as seen in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a> when the Israelites cried out under Egyptian oppression. Here, the cries are a result of rebellion against God's appointed leadership, echoing the seriousness of defying divine authority.<p><b>all the people of Israel who were around them fled</b><br>The reaction of the Israelites highlights the fear and recognition of God's power and judgment. Historically, the Israelites had witnessed numerous miracles and judgments, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. This event reinforces the idea that God is holy and just, and His judgments are to be feared. The fleeing of the people can be seen as an instinctive response to avoid being caught in the same judgment, similar to Lot fleeing Sodom in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.<p><b>saying, &#8220;The earth may swallow us too!&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the fear and realization among the Israelites that they could also face judgment if they align themselves with rebellion. It serves as a warning to the community about the consequences of sin and disobedience. The imagery of the earth swallowing is reminiscent of the grave and Sheol, often depicted as consuming the wicked (<a href="/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>). This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation of the righteous from the wicked, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, culminating in the final judgment described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Reubenites who joined Korah in his rebellion against Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, appointed by God to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, witnessing the judgment against the rebels and reacting in fear.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God's appointed leaders is ultimately rebellion against God Himself.

God&#8217;s judgment is not silent; it is unmistakable. Throughout Scripture, a cry in judgment often signals divine warning to onlookers&#8212;think of the Egyptians wailing in <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a> or the lament of Ananias and Sapphira&#8217;s congregation in <a href="/acts/5-5.htm">Acts 5:5, 10</a>&#8211;11. These cries remind every listener that the LORD&#8217;s holiness is non-negotiable and that rebellion invites swift, righteous response (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the people of Israel who were around them</b><p>The bystanders are not distant observers but neighbors who have witnessed the rebellion&#8217;s escalation (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1&#8211;19</a>).

When God&#8217;s power is unveiled, human self-preservation surfaces; compare the Israelites backing away from Sinai&#8217;s mountain (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>) or the Philistines retreating after the ark brings devastation (<a href="/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10&#8211;12</a>). Their running underscores <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>: &#8220;It will not be well with the wicked.&#8221; Yet fleeing also signals a moment of grace&#8212;there is still time to repent, to separate from defiance, much like the urgent escape urged in <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19&#8211;22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;The earth may swallow us too!&#8221;</b><p>Their words confess a healthy fear: God&#8217;s impartiality.

This echoes Jesus&#8217; warning in <a href="/luke/13-4.htm">Luke 13:4&#8211;5</a> about the tower in Siloam&#8212;tragedy is a call to personal repentance. The earth&#8217;s potential to swallow them highlights God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty over creation (<a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>) and the certainty that sin&#8217;s wages are death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).
