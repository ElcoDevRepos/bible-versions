In the ancient Near East, lions were seen as the ultimate predators, feared and respected by all. The lion's crouching and lying down suggest a state of rest and confidence, indicating that Israel, like a lion, is secure and unthreatened by its enemies. This metaphor is consistent with the portrayal of Israel as a formidable nation under God's protection. The rhetorical question "who dares to rouse him?" emphasizes the futility of opposing God's chosen people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>, where Judah is described as a lion's cub, and in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, where Jesus is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, highlighting the messianic connection and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<p><b>Blessed are those who bless you and cursed are those who curse you.</b><br>This phrase is a reiteration of the Abrahamic covenant found in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises Abraham that He will bless those who bless him and curse those who curse him. This covenantal promise extends to Abraham's descendants, the nation of Israel, and signifies God's enduring protection and favor. It underscores the principle that the treatment of God's people is directly linked to divine blessing or judgment. Historically, nations and individuals who have supported Israel have often experienced prosperity, while those who have opposed them have faced difficulties. This principle is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Balaam, who, despite being hired to curse Israel, ends up blessing them instead. Theologically, this promise points to the ultimate blessing found in Jesus Christ, through whom all nations are blessed, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

The nation is no longer on the move but settled, calm, and confident, much like <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a> where Judah &#8220;crouches&#8221; after victory.<p>- This posture signals readiness; a lion may look relaxed yet remains fully able to spring. In <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>, Benjamin &#8220;dwells securely&#8221; in the Lord&#8212;rest and security go hand in hand for God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He lies down like a lion</b><p>- Lying down conveys complete security. A lion only reclines when it fears no threat; so Israel, under God&#8217;s hand, enjoys peace that cannot be self-manufactured (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).<p>- <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> speaks of the Messiah shepherding His flock so they &#8220;will live securely,&#8221; echoing the same safe repose. God&#8217;s covenant presence turns a wilderness people into a settled, confident nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a lioness&#8212;who dares to rouse him?</b><p>- The question is rhetorical: no sane enemy would poke a resting lioness. In the same way, anyone provoking Israel faces God Himself (<a href="/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a> likens the Lord to a roaring lion undeterred by shepherds. When God guards His people, intimidation flows the other way: nations think twice before opposing them (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores deterrence; even when still, Israel is formidable because the Lord is with them (<a href="/zechariah/12-3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blessed are those who bless you</b><p>- This repeats the Abrahamic promise of <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>. God channels blessing through His chosen people, and allies share the overflow.<p>- Think of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/6-22.htm">Joshua 6:22-25</a>) or the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>); honoring God&#8217;s people drew God&#8217;s favor.<p>- Paul appeals to the Gentile churches to bless Israel materially because they had been blessed spiritually through Israel&#8217;s Messiah (<a href="/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cursed are those who curse you</b><p>- The flip side of the covenant: hostility toward God&#8217;s people invites God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>).<p>- Pharaoh&#8217;s Egypt experienced plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>); Haman fell into his own gallows (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>). <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a> reminds that &#8220;he who digs a pit will fall into it.&#8221;<p>- The promise still warns nations today: opposing God&#8217;s redemptive plan has serious consequences (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a> paints Israel as a lion at rest&#8212;powerful, secure, untouchable because the LORD stands behind her. Any who approach with goodwill share in God&#8217;s blessing; any who approach with malice inherit a curse. Balaam&#8217;s oracle therefore celebrates God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to protect and prosper His covenant people and cautions the world to align with, not against, the purposes of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion.--</span>The Hebrew <span class= "ital">labi </span>(great lion) should be rendered "a lioness," as in <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm" title="Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.">Numbers 23:24</a>.
