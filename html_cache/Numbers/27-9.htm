The absence of a daughter in this scenario highlights the patriarchal structure of the society, where male heirs were typically prioritized. This reflects the broader cultural norms of the ancient Near East, where lineage and inheritance were often passed through male descendants. The mention of a daughter here is significant because it follows the case of Zelophehad's daughters (<a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-8</a>), who successfully petitioned for the right to inherit their father's property, setting a precedent for female inheritance rights in specific circumstances.<p><b>give his inheritance to his brothers</b><br>This directive ensures that the inheritance remains within the immediate family, preserving the tribal allotment as originally distributed among the Israelites. The brothers of the deceased would be the next closest male relatives, maintaining the property within the same paternal line. This practice underscores the importance of family and tribal continuity in Israelite culture. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of family responsibility and care, as seen in other passages such as <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-10</a>, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer to preserve the family line of Elimelech. This principle of keeping inheritance within the family can be seen as a type of Christ, who as our kinsman-redeemer, restores and preserves our spiritual inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is receiving God's instructions regarding inheritance laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, to whom these laws are being given as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad's_daughters.htm">Zelophehad's Daughters</a></b><br>The context of this verse is part of a larger account where the daughters of Zelophehad petition Moses for their father's inheritance, as he had no sons.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance_laws.htm">Inheritance Laws</a></b><br>The specific legal instructions given by God to Moses concerning the distribution of property among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter and settle, necessitating clear inheritance laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_fairness.htm">God's Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>The inheritance laws reflect God's concern for justice and fairness, ensuring that property remains within the family even when there are no male heirs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_family_and_community.htm">Value of Family and Community</a></b><br>The instructions emphasize the importance of family and community in God's plan, as inheritance is meant to sustain and support the family unit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adaptability_of_god's_law.htm">Adaptability of God's Law</a></b><br>The case of Zelophehad's daughters shows that God's laws are adaptable to ensure justice, highlighting the importance of seeking God's guidance in unique situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_inheritance.htm">Spiritual Inheritance</a></b><br>As believers, our ultimate inheritance is spiritual, found in Christ, and is available to all, regardless of gender or lineage.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_27_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 27:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_27_9_s_impact_on_inheritance_now.htm">How does Numbers 27:9 guide inheritance rights within a family structure today?

The immediate context establishes a clear line of succession for inheritance when a man dies without sons.<p>- The provision safeguards the continuation of a family&#8217;s name and property within the tribe (compare <a href="/numbers/27-4.htm">Numbers 27:4</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>).<p>- It acknowledges that daughters are next in line after sons, underscoring God&#8217;s just concern for women when male heirs are absent (<a href="/numbers/27-7.htm">Numbers 27:7</a>).<p>- Cross references: <a href="/numbers/36-1.htm">Numbers 36:1-2</a> shows this principle balanced with tribal boundaries; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a> illustrates a related concern to preserve a family line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give his inheritance</b><p>- &#8220;Inheritance&#8221; refers to the land portion each family would receive in Canaan (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>).<p>- The command protects God-assigned allotments from being lost or absorbed by other families, fulfilling His covenant promise to Abraham&#8217;s descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6-7</a>).<p>- This reinforces that stewardship of land is sacred, entrusted by God rather than owned outright (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>- By legislating transfer rather than forfeiture, the Lord preserves economic stability and identity within Israel&#8217;s community (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To his brothers</b><p>- If neither sons nor daughters exist, the estate passes laterally to the deceased man&#8217;s brothers (<a href="/numbers/27-10.htm">Numbers 27:10</a> continues the chain).<p>- This keeps the property within the father&#8217;s immediate clan, maintaining tribal integrity (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7-9</a>).<p>- The practice anticipates Christ&#8217;s concern that His people care for close relatives (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) and reflects the broader command to honor family obligations (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p>- It points ahead to our eternal inheritance secured through our &#8220;Brother&#8221; Jesus, who redeems and keeps our place in God&#8217;s family (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-9.htm">Numbers 27:9</a> shows God&#8217;s orderly plan to ensure every family in Israel retains its God-given inheritance.
