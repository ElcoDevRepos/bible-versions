Moses is seen as the mediator between God and His people, a role that foreshadows Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The commandments include not only the Ten Commandments but also the detailed laws found in the Torah, which cover moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of life. These laws were intended to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's revealed will, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>from the day the LORD gave them</b><br>This refers to the specific historical moment when God delivered the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, an event that is central to Israel's identity and covenant relationship with God (Exodus 19-20). The giving of the law marked a new phase in God's redemptive plan, establishing a covenant that required Israel's faithfulness. This moment is also a type of the new covenant established through Christ, who fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and continuing through the generations to come&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the perpetual nature of God's commandments. The laws were not just for the immediate generation but were intended to guide all future generations of Israelites. This continuity underscores the unchanging nature of God's standards and His desire for a lasting relationship with His people. It also points to the enduring relevance of God's Word, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>. The generational aspect of the law is mirrored in the New Testament's call for the faith to be passed down (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who gives commandments to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of Israel, through whom God communicated His laws and commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are the recipients of the commandments and laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law and wandered for 40 years.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/generations_to_come.htm">Generations to Come</a></b><br>Refers to the future descendants of the Israelites who are also bound by these commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_perpetuity_of_god's_commandments.htm">The Perpetuity of God's Commandments</a></b><br>God's commandments are not just historical but are intended for all generations.

In <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22&#8211;24</a> the Lord addresses unintentional sin &#8220;against any of these commandments,&#8221; reminding Israel that the entire revealed will of God is binding.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore calls the people to remember every statute, ritual, moral precept, and civil guideline, because each reflects God&#8217;s holy character (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the principle remains: God&#8217;s Word is an indivisible whole that deserves careful obedience (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through Moses</b><p>&#8226; God chose Moses as the human channel for His covenant law, so disobeying the law meant rejecting the Lord&#8217;s appointed mediator (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>; <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Through Moses&#8221; also anchors the commands in real history, showing that the faith is grounded in actual events, not myth (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament later points to Christ as the greater Mediator (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>), but <a href="/bsb/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a> emphasizes that, at this stage of redemptive history, Moses&#8217; words carry divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the day the LORD gave them</b><p>&#8226; The obligation to obey began the very moment the law was delivered at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel could not plead ignorance; the covenant was accepted publicly and ratified with blood, making it legally binding (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase teaches that revelation brings responsibility&#8212;once God speaks, He expects a response (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and continuing through the generations to come&#8212;</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s commands are not limited to the first audience; they shape the life and worship of every succeeding generation (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The trajectory points forward to Christ, who fulfills the law without nullifying its moral demands (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The perpetual scope underscores God&#8217;s unchanging standard and His desire for a covenant people who reflect His holiness across time (<a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a> gathers every divine instruction&#8212;delivered by Moses, effective from Sinai, and intended for all future generations&#8212;into one sweeping statement. The verse reminds Israel (and us) that God&#8217;s revealed will is comprehensive, authoritative, historically grounded, and perpetually relevant. Obedience to the whole counsel of Scripture is not merely a past requirement but an ongoing call to walk in covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And henceforward.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">and onward, </span>or <span class= "ital">thenceforward. </span>There is nothing in the word which is here used to denote whether the reference is or is not to legislation of a later date than that at which the words were spoken.
