This phrase indicates a moment of crisis, as the assembly was likely in a state of unrest due to the lack of water. The act of leaving the assembly shows their reliance on God rather than human solutions. This is a recurring theme in the wilderness journey, where the leaders seek divine guidance in times of trouble.<p><b>to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the designated place where God communicated with Moses and Aaron. It was a sacred space, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a place of divine encounter, where significant revelations and instructions were given. This setting underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>They fell facedown</b><br>Falling facedown is an act of worship, submission, and humility before God. It signifies recognition of God's sovereignty and the leaders' dependence on Him. This posture is seen throughout Scripture as a response to God's presence or in times of urgent supplication (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). It reflects the gravity of the situation and the leaders' earnest plea for guidance.<p><b>and the glory of the LORD appeared to them</b><br>The glory of the LORD, often associated with a visible manifestation of God's presence, is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. It signifies God's approval, presence, and power. In this context, it indicates that God is attentive to the plight of His people and ready to provide a solution. The appearance of God's glory reassures Moses and Aaron of His continued guidance and support. This moment foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, who is described as the radiance of God's glory in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
