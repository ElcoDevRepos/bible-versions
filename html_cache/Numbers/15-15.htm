The term "assembly" refers to the congregation of Israel, which includes both native-born Israelites and those who have joined them. This reflects God's desire for a unified people under His law, as seen in other parts of the Torah where the law is given to all members of the community (<a href="/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>).<p><b>both for you and for the foreign resident</b><br>The inclusion of the "foreign resident" highlights the openness of the Israelite community to those who were not originally part of the covenant people. This is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where many societies had strict divisions between natives and foreigners. The law's application to both groups underscores the fairness and justice of God's statutes, as well as His intention for Israel to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><b>it is a permanent statute for the generations to come</b><br>The phrase "permanent statute" indicates the enduring nature of this command. It is not a temporary measure but a lasting ordinance meant to be observed by future generations. This reflects the unchanging nature of God's law and His eternal covenant with His people. The continuity of this statute is echoed in the New Testament, where the principles of God's law are fulfilled and expanded through Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>).<p><b>You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD</b><br>This statement reinforces the idea of equality before God, regardless of one's ethnic or cultural background. It prefigures the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The phrase "before the LORD" signifies that this equality is not just a social or legal matter but a spiritual truth recognized by God Himself. This foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Gospel, where all believers are united in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Book of Numbers, the Israelites are God's chosen people, journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_residents.htm">Foreign Residents (Gerim)</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, often referred to as "sojourners" or "strangers" in other translations.
