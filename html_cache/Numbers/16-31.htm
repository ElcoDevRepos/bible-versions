Moses had just declared that if the rebels died a natural death, then the Lord had not sent him. This highlights the authority and prophetic role of Moses as God's chosen leader. The immediacy also underscores the seriousness of the rebellion against God's appointed leadership. In the broader biblical context, this reflects the pattern of God confirming His messengers through signs and wonders, as seen with Elijah and Elisha.<p><b>the ground beneath them</b><br>The ground is often symbolic in Scripture, representing stability and foundation. In this context, it becomes an instrument of divine judgment. The earth itself responds to God's command, demonstrating His sovereignty over creation. This event is reminiscent of other instances where God uses natural elements to execute judgment, such as the plagues in Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where creation will again play a role, as seen in Revelation.<p><b>split open</b><br>The splitting of the ground is a miraculous event, signifying a direct act of God. This act of judgment is unique in its execution, emphasizing the severity of the rebellion. It serves as a warning to the Israelites and future generations about the consequences of opposing God's ordained leadership. The imagery of the earth opening is also found in prophetic literature, symbolizing destruction and divine wrath. This event can be seen as a type of final judgment, where those who oppose God face ultimate separation from His presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that God hears, acts, and confirms His word&#8212;calling His people to reverent obedience and trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ground clave asunder that was under them.</span> As it sometimes does during an earthquake. In this case, however, the event was predicted, and wholly supernatural. The sequence of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the earth opened beneath the tents of Dathan and Abiram in the camp of Reuben. It is difficult to think of the gulf as extending so far as to involve the tent of Korah in the Kohathite lines in the same destruction, while there is nothing to suggest the idea that the earth opened in more than one place. It is true that the camps of the Reubenites and of the Kohathites were more or less contiguous; but when it is remembered that there were 46,500 adult males in the former, and 8600 males in the latter, and that a broad space must have been left between the two lines of encampment, it is obviously improbable that Korah's tent was in a practical sense "near" to those of Dathan and Abiram, unless indeed he had purposely removed it in order to be under the protection of his Reubenite partisans. It is very observable that not a word is said here as to the fate of Korah himself. It is implied in verse 40 that he had perished, and it is apparently asserted in <a href="/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a> that he was swallowed up with Dathan and Abiram (see the note there). On the other hand, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-17.htm">Psalm 106:17</a> speak of the engulfing of the other two without any mention of Korah himself sharing their fate; and while "all the men that appertained unto Korah" perished, his own sons did not (<a href="/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>). On these grounds it is held by most commentators that Korah died by fire among those who offered incense (verse 35). This, however, is untenable, because "the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense" are distinctly mentioned as having been his partisans (verse 2), and are always counted exclusive of Korah himself. On the whole, while it is certain that the narrative is very obscure, and the question very doubtful, it seems most agreeable to all the testimonies of Holy Scripture to conclude - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Korah had left his own place, and had some sort of dwelling (mischan) either in common with Dathan and Abiram, or hard by their tents. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the earth opened and swallowed up the <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, of Korah, and the tents of Dathan and Abiram. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That Korah's men (see next verse) and their property were swallowed up with his <span class="accented">mishcan</span>, and (as far as we can tell) Korah himself also. If this be correct, then the much disputed heading of the chapter in the A.V. will be right after all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/16-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as [Moses] had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
