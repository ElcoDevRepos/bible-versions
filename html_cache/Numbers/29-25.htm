The goat symbolizes the removal of sin and impurity from the community, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> during the Day of Atonement. The male goat, specifically, is often associated with atonement for the leaders or the community as a whole. This offering underscores the need for purification and reconciliation with God, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement. The sin offering points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering</b><br>The regular burnt offering was a daily ritual, signifying the people's continual dedication and commitment to God. It was a holistic offering, with the entire animal consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender to God's will. This regular offering served as a constant reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The addition of the sin offering to the regular burnt offering emphasizes the layered nature of Israel's worship, where atonement and dedication go hand in hand. This practice foreshadows the comprehensive work of Christ, who fulfills both the need for atonement and the call to live a life wholly dedicated to God.<p><b>with its grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, often accompanying burnt offerings, represents the fruits of human labor and the acknowledgment of God's provision. It was typically made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing purity, abundance, and the joy of fellowship with God. This offering highlights the importance of gratitude and recognition of God's sustenance in daily life. In the New Testament, believers are encouraged to offer their lives as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), echoing the dedication symbolized by the grain offering.<p><b>and drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, usually wine, was poured out at the altar, symbolizing the outpouring of one's life in service to God. It complements the burnt and grain offerings, completing the sacrificial act. The drink offering signifies joy and celebration in the presence of God, as well as the willingness to be poured out for His purposes. The Apostle Paul uses this imagery in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, where he describes his life as being poured out like a drink offering, indicating his total commitment to the gospel and the church. This element of the offering system points to the sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry and the call for believers to emulate His example.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for worship and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where these sacrifices were to be offered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival during which these sacrifices were made, commemorating the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the rituals as prescribed by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's instructions precisely, demonstrating their obedience and reverence for His holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The unblemished animals symbolize purity and foreshadow the perfect sacrifice of Christ, who was without sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_presence.htm">God's Provision and Presence</a></b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles reminds believers of God's provision and presence during the Israelites' wilderness journey, encouraging trust in God's faithfulness today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>The communal aspect of these sacrifices highlights the importance of corporate worship and unity among God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_reflection_and_renewal.htm">Spiritual Reflection and Renewal</a></b><br>The repetition of sacrifices during the festival invites believers to reflect on their spiritual state and seek renewal through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 29:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_29_25_stress_festival_duty.htm">How does Numbers 29:25 emphasize the importance of observing God's appointed festivals?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_offerings_in_worship_Num_29_25.htm">What role do offerings play in our worship according to Numbers 29:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Numbers_29_25_to_modern_worship.htm">How can we apply the principles of Numbers 29:25 to our worship today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_29_25_link_to_NT_sacrifice.htm">What connections exist between Numbers 29:25 and New Testament teachings on sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Numbers_29_25_boost_faith.htm">How does observing God's commands in Numbers 29:25 strengthen our faith community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Offerings_meaning_in_Numbers_29_25_today.htm">What is the significance of the offerings in Numbers 29:25 for modern believers?

That single animal reminds us that God requires a specific, unblemished sacrifice for sin, foreshadowing the ultimate &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Earlier festivals also called for a lone goat (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23&#8211;24</a>), underscoring consistency in God&#8217;s provision for cleansing (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a sin offering</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;as a sin offering&#8221;. This offering dealt with unintentional sins (<a href="/leviticus/4-1.htm">Leviticus 4:1&#8211;3</a>). Even during joyful feasts, Israel had to confront sin&#8217;s reality (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). The sin offering pointed forward to Christ, &#8220;who knew no sin&#8221; yet was &#8220;made sin for us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>Key truths:<p>&#8226; Sin is ever-present and needs atonement, even in worshipful celebration.<p>&#8226; God graciously provides a substitute, satisfying His justice while extending mercy (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to</b><p>&#8220;...in addition to&#8230;&#8221; signals that the sin offering did not replace other sacrifices; it supplemented them.

Our modern worship likewise combines praise with ongoing repentance (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The regular burnt offering</b><p>The daily burnt offering (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38&#8211;42</a>) symbolized total dedication. Adding the sin-offering goat shows that consecration flows from cleansing (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). We cannot give ourselves wholly to God without first being purified by Him (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With its grain offering</b><p>The grain (or meal) offering accompanied the burnt offering (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;8</a>). It expressed gratitude for God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9&#8211;13</a>). Once sin is atoned for, thankful service naturally follows (<a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>Practical takeaway: forgiven people become generous people, offering the firstfruits of work and resources.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And drink offering</b><p>The drink offering&#8212;wine poured out beside the altar (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>)&#8212;symbolized joy and complete surrender (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>). Together with the grain, it paints a picture of life fully yielded and overflowing in celebration of God&#8217;s grace (<a href="/psalms/116-12.htm">Psalm 116:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-25.htm">Numbers 29:25</a> weaves cleansing and consecration into one verse. A single male goat covers sin; routine burnt, grain, and drink offerings celebrate ongoing devotion, gratitude, and joy. The order matters: forgiveness first, wholehearted worship second. In Christ, every element finds fulfillment, inviting us to live forgiven, dedicated, thankful, and poured-out lives before our holy God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Include one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male goat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
