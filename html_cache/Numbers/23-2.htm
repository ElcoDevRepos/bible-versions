This obedience highlights Balak's desperation to curse the Israelites, who were encamped on the plains of Moab. The narrative underscores the tension between divine will and human attempts to manipulate it. Balak's compliance also reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of seeking divine favor through intermediaries like Balaam.<p><b>and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar</b><br>The offering of a bull and a ram on each altar is significant in the context of ancient sacrificial practices. Bulls and rams were considered valuable sacrifices, often associated with atonement and seeking favor from deities. This act of sacrifice is intended to invoke a divine response, aligning with the cultural understanding of appeasing gods through offerings. The use of multiple altars suggests an attempt to ensure the effectiveness of the ritual, emphasizing the seriousness of Balak's request. This scene also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament sacrificial system, offering Himself as the perfect atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse the Israelites, known for his interactions with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built for the purpose of offering sacrifices, in this case, seven altars were constructed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The offering of a bull and a ram on each altar, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, God&#8217;s will prevails.
