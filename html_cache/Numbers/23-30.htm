This obedience highlights Balak's desperation to curse the Israelites, who were encamped on the plains of Moab. The historical context shows the fear and anxiety of the Moabites as they faced the advancing Israelites. This act of following Balaam's instructions also reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of seeking divine favor through prophetic intermediaries.<p><b>and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar</b><br>The offering of a bull and a ram on each altar is significant in the context of ancient sacrificial practices. Bulls and rams were considered valuable sacrifices, often associated with seeking favor or appeasement from deities. This act of sacrifice is consistent with the Levitical laws found in the Pentateuch, where bulls and rams are frequently mentioned as offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9, 8</a>:18-21). Theologically, this can be seen as a futile attempt to manipulate divine will, contrasting with the biblical theme that true worship and obedience to God cannot be bought or coerced. The use of multiple altars indicates the seriousness and intensity of Balak's desire to secure a curse against Israel, yet it also foreshadows the futility of opposing God's chosen people, as seen in the broader narrative of <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is hired by Balak to curse the Israelites but is ultimately used by God to bless them instead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, representing opposition to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built by Balak and Balaam for the purpose of offering sacrifices, hoping to gain favor for cursing Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The bull and ram offered on each altar, representing attempts to manipulate divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god_over_human_desires.htm">Obedience to God Over Human Desires</a></b><br>Balaam's account reminds us that God's will prevails over human intentions.

Balaam&#8217;s directions reveal that he recognizes the true God&#8217;s supremacy, though his heart remains compromised (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; This scene reminds us of Caiaphas, who unwittingly prophesied truth while opposing Christ (<a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49&#8211;52</a>).<p>&#8226;

Balak&#8217;s costly effort contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s free blessing promised to Abraham: &#8220;I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-30.htm">Numbers 23:30</a> captures a pagan king&#8217;s earnest yet futile attempt to manipulate the Almighty through ritual, carried out exactly as the prophet directed. Balak&#8217;s obedience, Balaam&#8217;s compromised leadership, and the repeated sacrifices all converge to display God&#8217;s unassailable commitment to bless Israel. The verse reminds believers that no amount of human scheming can overturn God&#8217;s declared purposes, and that He can even employ reluctant or unrighteous agents to advance His redemptive plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/23-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Balak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;l&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1111.htm">Strong's 1111: </a> </span><span class="str2">Balak -- 'devastator', a Moabite king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
