In the context of the Tabernacle, anointing with oil was a common practice to symbolize the presence and blessing of God. This act parallels the anointing of priests and kings, indicating a special role or purpose. The altar's anointing can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate anointed one (Messiah), set apart for the redemption of humanity.<p><b>the leaders approached</b><br>The leaders here refer to the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their approach signifies unity and collective responsibility in worship and dedication to God. This act of leadership in worship reflects the importance of godly leadership in guiding the people in spiritual matters. It also emphasizes the communal aspect of worship, where leaders represent their people before God.<p><b>with their offerings for its dedication</b><br>The offerings brought by the leaders were part of the dedication ceremony of the altar. These offerings included silver plates, gold bowls, and various animals for sacrifice, as detailed in the surrounding verses. The dedication offerings symbolize the people's commitment to God and their desire to honor Him. This act of giving is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of offering oneself as a living sacrifice (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>and presented them before the altar</b><br>Presenting the offerings before the altar signifies an act of worship and submission to God. The altar, as the place of sacrifice, represents the meeting point between God and man. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, where He presented Himself as the perfect offering for sin. The presentation of offerings also highlights the importance of approaching God with reverence and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_israel.htm">Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>These were the heads of the tribes of Israel, responsible for bringing offerings for the dedication of the altar.

But it could still be "dedicated" in another sense by the sacrificial gifts, freely offered for the purpose, of the people. No rules appear to have been made as to dedications, but there is an allusion in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a> to the dedication of houses, which may have been accompanied with religions rites, and we know that as a fact the temple was dedicated by Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>), and re-dedicated by the Maccabees (1 Macc. 4:54, <span class="accented">sq.</span>), and the wall of Jerusalem was dedicated by Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, sq.).
