In the context of <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, it follows the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, where God demonstrated His judgment by causing the earth to swallow the rebels. The immediacy suggests the people's short memory and quickness to return to discontent, highlighting a recurring theme of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith throughout their wilderness journey.<p><b>the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>This refers to the entire assembly of the Israelites, emphasizing the widespread nature of the discontent. The term "congregation" is often used in the Pentateuch to describe the collective body of the Israelites, who were bound by covenant to God. This collective grumbling reflects a communal failure to trust in God's appointed leaders and His divine plan.<p><b>grumbled against Moses and Aaron</b><br>Grumbling against leadership is a recurring theme in the wilderness narratives. Moses and Aaron, as God's appointed leaders, often bore the brunt of the people's dissatisfaction. This grumbling is not just against human leaders but is seen as a direct challenge to God's authority, as Moses and Aaron were His chosen representatives. This reflects a deeper spiritual issue of rebellion against God Himself.<p><b>saying, &#8220;You have killed the LORD&#8217;s people!&#8221;</b><br>The accusation that Moses and Aaron have killed "the LORD&#8217;s people" is both ironic and tragic. The rebels who perished were judged by God for their insurrection, yet the congregation blames Moses and Aaron. This reflects a misunderstanding or willful ignorance of God's justice and the seriousness of rebellion against Him. The phrase "the LORD&#8217;s people" underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, yet the people fail to recognize that their rebellion jeopardizes this relationship. This incident foreshadows the ultimate rejection of God's chosen leaders, culminating in the rejection of Jesus Christ, who was also accused unjustly by His own people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

In speaking of Korah and his company as the "people of the Lord," they meant to say that their lives were as sacred as the lives of Moses and Aaron, and the crime of taking them as great; they did not know, or did not heed, that their own immunity was due to the intercession of those whom they thus charged with sacrilegious murder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/16-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The next day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7717;o&#183;r&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
