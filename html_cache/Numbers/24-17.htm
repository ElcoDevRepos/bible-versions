The speaker, Balaam, is a non-Israelite prophet who is being used by God to deliver a message about Israel's future. This vision is distant, suggesting a messianic prophecy that will be fulfilled in the distant future. The use of "see" implies a spiritual insight rather than physical sight, indicating that Balaam is receiving divine revelation.<p><b>I behold him, but not near.</b><br>The repetition of the idea that the vision is not near emphasizes the long-term nature of the prophecy. This suggests that the fulfillment of this prophecy will occur after a significant passage of time. The term "behold" reinforces the idea of a vision or revelation, indicating that Balaam is perceiving something significant about Israel's destiny.<p><b>A star will come forth from Jacob,</b><br>The "star" is often interpreted as a symbol of a king or a significant leader. In ancient Near Eastern culture, stars were commonly associated with deities or rulers. This prophecy is traditionally understood to refer to the coming of a future king from the lineage of Jacob, which Christians interpret as a reference to Jesus Christ. The imagery of a star also connects to the star of Bethlehem in the New Testament, which guided the Magi to the birthplace of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>).<p><b>and a scepter will arise from Israel.</b><br>The "scepter" symbolizes authority and kingship. This phrase indicates the emergence of a ruler from Israel who will have dominion and power. The scepter is a common biblical symbol for royal authority, as seen in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where it is prophesied that the scepter will not depart from Judah. This connection reinforces the messianic interpretation, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy.<p><b>He will crush the skulls of Moab</b><br>This part of the prophecy speaks of victory and conquest over Moab, a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel. The imagery of crushing skulls signifies a decisive and complete victory. Historically, Moab was a persistent adversary of Israel, and this prophecy foretells a time when Israel's king will triumph over its enemies. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil.<p><b>and strike down all the sons of Sheth.</b><br>The "sons of Sheth" is a more obscure reference, with interpretations varying among scholars. Some suggest it refers to a group or tribe known for opposing Israel, while others see it as a symbolic representation of all Israel's enemies. The phrase indicates a comprehensive victory over opposition. In a broader sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate triumph of Christ over all forces of evil and opposition to God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel.

(Comp. <a href="/jude/1-14.htm" title="And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,">Jude 1:14</a> : "Behold the Lord cometh"--literally, <span class= "ital">came.</span>) If there is any ambiguity in the first symbol it is removed in the second. A star is a fitting image of an illustrious king or ruler, and the mention of the <span class= "ital">sceptre </span>in the words which follow (comp. <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>) shows that it is so employed in the present instance. The Targum of Onkelos is as follows:--"When the King shall arise out of Jacob, and the Messiah shall be anointed from Israel." The Targum of Palestine reads thus:--"A King is to arise from the house of Jacob, and a Redeemer and Ruler from the house of Israel." Ibn Ezra interprets these words of David, but he says that many interpret them of the Messiah. It seems to have been with reference to this prophecy that the pretender to the title of the Messiah in the days of the Emperor Adrian took the name of <span class= "ital">Bar-cochab, </span>or <span class= "ital">Bar-cochba </span>(the son of a star). The words of the Magi, "We have seen his star in the East" (<a href="/matthew/2-2.htm" title="Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.">Matthew 2:2</a>), appear to have reference to this prophecy.<p><span class= "bld">And shall smite the corners of Moab.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">the two sides of Moab. </span>The prophecy was partially, or typically, fulfilled in the time of David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.">2Samuel 8:2</a>). Moab and Edom represented symbolically the enemies of Christ and of His Church, and as such will eventually be subdued by the King of kings. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh.</span> Rather, "I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not near" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>...<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> exactly as in <a href="/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>). Balaam does not mean to say that he expected himself to see at any future time the mysterious Being of whom he speaks, who is identical with the "Star" and the "Scepter" of the following clauses; he speaks wholly as a prophet, and means that his inner gaze is fixed upon such an one, with full assurance that he exists in the counsels of God, but with clear recognition of the fact that his actual coming is yet in the far future. <span class="cmt_word">There shall come a Star out</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Jacob.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may quite as well be rendered by the present; Balaam simply utters what passes before his inward vision. The star is a natural and common poetic symbol of an illustrious, or, as we say, "brilliant," personage, and as such recurs many times in Scripture (cf. <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>). The celebrated Jewish fanatic called himself Barcochab, "son of the Star," in allusion to this prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">A Scepter shall rise out of Israel.</span> This further defines the "star ' as a ruler of men, for the scepter is Used in that sense in the dying prophecy of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), with which Balaam was evidently acquainted. Accordingly the Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall smite the corners of Moab.</span> Rather, "the two corners" (dual), or "the two sides of Moab," i.e., shall crush Moab on either side. <span class="cmt_word">And destroy all the children of Sheth.</span> In <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, where this prophecy is in a manner quoted, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">qarqar</span>, destroy) is altered into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">quadqod</span>, crown of the head). This raises a very curious and interesting question as to the use made by the prophets of the earlier Scriptures, but it gives no authority for an alteration of the text. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> has been variously rendered. The Jewish commentators, followed by the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;</span>) and the older versions, understand it to mean the sons of Seth, the son of Adam, i.e., all mankind. Many modern commentators, however, take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a> - "desolation"), and read "sons of confusion," as equivalent to the unruly neighbours and relations of Israel. This, however, is extremely dubious in itself, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> nowhere occurs in this sense, and derives no sup. port from <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. It is true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> is there replaced by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "sons of tumult," but then this very verse affords the clearest evidence that the prophet felt no hesitation in altering the text of Scripture to suit his own inspired purpose. If it be true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> will not bear the meaning given to it in the Targums of "reign over," still there is no insuperable difficulty in the common rendering. Jewish prophecy, from beginning to end, contemplated the Messiah as the Conqueror, the Subduer, and even the Destroyer of all the heathen, i.e., of all who were not Jews. It is only in the New Testament that the iron scepter with which he was to dash in pieces the heathen (<a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>) becomes the pastoral staff wherewith he shepherds them (<a href="/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> after the Septuagint, which has here misread the text). The prophecy was that Messiah should destroy the heathen; the fulfillment that he destroyed not them, but their heathenism (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6-9</a> with <a href="/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I see him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1433;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;er&#183;&#8217;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
