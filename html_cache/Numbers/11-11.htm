This phrase highlights the intimate relationship Moses had with the LORD, serving as an intermediary between God and the people. It reflects the biblical theme of prayer and supplication, where leaders and prophets seek divine guidance and express their concerns to God. This direct communication is a precursor to the New Testament concept of believers having direct access to God through Jesus Christ.<p><b>Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant?</b><br>Moses expresses his frustration and sense of being overwhelmed by the responsibilities placed upon him. This reflects the human aspect of biblical leaders who, despite their faith, experience moments of doubt and struggle. The term "servant" underscores Moses' role as a chosen leader, yet it also highlights the burdens that come with leadership. This echoes the struggles of other biblical figures, such as Elijah and Jeremiah, who also questioned their burdens.<p><b>Why have I not found favor in Your sight</b><br>Finding favor in God's sight is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with divine approval and blessing. Moses' question suggests a feeling of alienation or a perceived lack of divine support. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative where individuals like Noah, Abraham, and Mary found favor with God, leading to significant roles in His plan. It also foreshadows the ultimate favor found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's will.<p><b>that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people?</b><br>The "burden" refers to the leadership and responsibility Moses had over the Israelites, who were often rebellious and difficult to manage. This phrase highlights the challenges of leadership and the weight of responsibility that comes with guiding a large, often discontented group. It can be compared to the burdens carried by other leaders in the Bible, such as King David and the Apostle Paul. This also serves as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate burden of humanity's sin, offering a parallel to the sacrificial leadership Moses exemplified.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses now feels that favor has vanished, though it has not.<p>- Moments of fatigue can distort perception: feelings clash with facts. David experienced similar tension in <a href="/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1-2</a>.<p>- Moses measures favor by immediate ease; God measures it by eternal purpose (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people?</b><p>- The load is heavy: perhaps two million Israelites (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>).

Leaders&#8212;and all believers&#8212;may question, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; The Lord invites such honesty, answers with provision, and proves that His favor is not the absence of hardship but His sustaining presence amid it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Wherefore hast thou afflicted.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">done evil to: </span>the same verb, in a different conjugation, which is rendered "displeased" in <a href="/numbers/11-10.htm" title="Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.">Numbers 11:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?</span> These passionate complaints were clearly wrong, because exaggerated. God had <span class="accented">not</span> thrown upon Moses the responsibility of getting the people safely into Canaan, or of providing flesh for them; and apart from these exaggerations, it was a selfish and cowardly thing thus to dwell upon his own grievance, and to leave out of sight the grave dishonour done to God, and the awful danger incurred by the people. It was the more blameworthy in Moses because upon a former occasion he had taken upon him, with almost perilous boldness, to remonstrate with God, and to protest against the vengeance he threatened to inflict (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>). In a word, Moses forgot himself and his duty as mediator, and in his indignation at the sin of the people committed the same sin himself. It is a strong note of genuineness that so grave (and yet so natural) a fault should be recorded with such obvious simplicity.
