Throughout the Pentateuch, Moses is depicted as a mediator between God and the Israelites, highlighting his unique relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>). This divine communication underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where God directly guides His people.<p><b>Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel</b><br>The number seventy is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The selection of seventy elders reflects a structured leadership model, reminiscent of the seventy nations listed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. This group would later parallel the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which also consisted of seventy members.<p><b>known to you as leaders and officers of the people</b><br>These elders were already recognized for their leadership and administrative roles within the community. Their prior experience and reputation among the people were crucial for maintaining order and ensuring the effective governance of the Israelites. This mirrors the New Testament principle of appointing leaders who are "above reproach" (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>).<p><b>Bring them to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and divine encounter for the Israelites. It symbolized God's presence among His people and served as the location for significant religious and communal events. This setting underscores the sacred nature of the task and the divine authority behind the appointment of the elders.<p><b>and have them stand there with you</b><br>Standing with Moses at the Tent of Meeting signifies the elders' shared responsibility and authority in leading the people. This act of standing together represents unity and collective leadership, which is essential for the governance of the nation. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of shared leadership within the church, as seen in the appointment of elders in <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks directly to Moses, providing guidance and instruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventy_elders.htm">Seventy Elders</a></b><br>A group of leaders and officials among the Israelites, chosen to assist Moses in governing and leading the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>A sacred place where Moses meets with God, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_delegation.htm">The Importance of Delegation</a></b><br>God recognizes the burden of leadership on Moses and provides a solution through delegation.

Frequent mention is made in Scripture of the number <span class= "ital">seventy--</span>a number which is composed of the two sacred numbers <span class= "ital">seven </span>and <span class= "ital">ten</span>--the former being the seal of the covenant, and the latter probably denoting perfection. The seventy who were chosen on the present occasion may have consisted of some of those who were appointed as judges at the suggestion of Jethro, but there is no evidence of their identity with any persons previously selected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Moses.</span> The Divine dignity and goodness of this answer, if not an absolutely conclusive testimony, are at least a very strong one, to the genuineness of this record. Of what god, except the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was it ever witnessed, or could it have been ever imagined, that he should answer the passionate injustice of his servant with such forbearance and kindness? The one thing in Moses' prayer which was reasonable he allowed at once; the rest he passed over without answer or reproof, as though it had never been uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel.</span> That the number seventy has a symbolic significance in Scripture will hardly be denied (cf. <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2, 24</a>; <a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), although it is probably futile to affix any precise meaning to it. Perhaps the leading idea of seventy is fullness, as that of twelve is symmetry (see on Exodus 15:27). The later Jews believed that there were seventy nations in the world. There is no reason, except a reckless desire to confound the sacred narrative, to identify this appointment with that narrated in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> and <a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> The circumstances and the purposes appear quite distinct: those were appointed to assist Moses in purely secular matters, to share his burden as a judge; these to assist him in religious matters, to support him as a mediator; those used the ordinary gifts of wisdom, discretion, and personal authority; these the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. It is more reasonable to suppose that these seventy were the same men that went up into Mount Sinai with Moses, and saw the God of Israel, and ate of the consecrated meal of the covenant, about a year before. Unless there was some decisive reason against it, an elder who had been chosen for that high religious privilege could hardly fail to be chosen on this occasion also; an interview with God himself, so mysteriously and awfully significant, must surely have left an ineffaceable stamp of sanctity on any soul at all worthy of it. It would be natural to suppose that while the present selection was made <span class="accented">de novo</span>, the individuals selected were personally the same. Compare note on chapter Numbers 1:5, and for "the elders of Israel" see on Exodus 3:16. <span class="cmt_word">Whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and officers over them.</span> On the officers (Hebrew, <span class="accented">shoterim</span>), an ancient order in the national organization of Israel, continued from the days of bondage, see <a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>.
