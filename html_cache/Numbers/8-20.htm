Moses and Aaron, as leaders, represent the spiritual and administrative guidance of the people. The inclusion of the "whole congregation" emphasizes communal responsibility and participation in religious duties. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious and civil life were intertwined. The involvement of the entire congregation underscores the importance of collective obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in the Pentateuch.<p><b>did with the Levites</b><br>The Levites were set apart for specific religious duties, serving as assistants to the priests and caretakers of the tabernacle. This phrase indicates the fulfillment of God's instructions regarding the Levites' consecration and service. The Levites' role is crucial, as they are responsible for maintaining the holiness of the tabernacle, which is central to Israel's worship and relationship with God. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), serving God in various capacities.<p><b>everything that the LORD had commanded</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of complete obedience to God's commands. The Israelites' adherence to divine instructions is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often linked to blessings and covenantal faithfulness. The meticulous observance of God's commands reflects the seriousness with which the Israelites approached their covenant relationship with God. This obedience is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of following God's will as revealed in Scripture.<p><b>Moses they should do</b><br>Moses, as the mediator between God and the people, is the conduit through which God's commands are communicated. His leadership is pivotal in ensuring that the Israelites adhere to divine instructions. This phrase highlights the authority of Moses, which is affirmed by God throughout the Exodus narrative. Moses' role as a mediator is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). Moses' faithfulness in executing God's commands serves as an example of leadership and obedience for all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
