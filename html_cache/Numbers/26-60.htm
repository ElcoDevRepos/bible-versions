This incident underscores the importance of obedience and reverence in worship, highlighting the holiness required in approaching God. Their story serves as a warning about the consequences of disregarding God's commands.<p><b>Eleazar</b><br>Eleazar was the third son of Aaron and succeeded his father as high priest after Aaron's death (<a href="/numbers/20-25.htm">Numbers 20:25-28</a>). He played a significant role in the leadership of Israel during the wilderness period and the conquest of Canaan. Eleazar's priesthood is marked by faithfulness and adherence to God's laws, contrasting with the fate of his older brothers. He is also involved in the distribution of the land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>). Eleazar's role as high priest is a type of Christ, who is our eternal High Priest, mediating between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Ithamar</b><br>Ithamar was the youngest son of Aaron and served as a priest alongside his brothers. He was responsible for the oversight of the tabernacle and its furnishings (<a href="/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>). Ithamar's descendants continued the priestly line, and his lineage is mentioned in the genealogies of the priests (<a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-6</a>). His role emphasizes the continuity and faithfulness required in the service of God, as well as the importance of family lineage in the priesthood.<p><b>were born to Aaron</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel, establishing the Aaronic priesthood (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). His sons, as part of this priestly line, were integral to the religious life of Israel, serving in the tabernacle and later the temple. The priesthood of Aaron and his sons is a foreshadowing of the ultimate priesthood of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament priestly system (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11-28</a>). Aaron's family highlights the theme of divine election and the responsibilities that come with being chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

<a href="/numbers/26-60.htm">Numbers 26:60</a> reminds us that this privilege began at birth, yet privilege required obedience; Nadab&#8217;s later disregard for God&#8217;s holiness cost him his life (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>;
