The tribe of Manasseh is significant because it is one of the two half-tribes that, along with Ephraim, make up the house of Joseph. Manasseh's inheritance was divided, with half settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other half on the west. This division is a reflection of the tribe's size and influence. The tribe of Manasseh played a crucial role in the conquest and settlement of the Promised Land, as seen in the book of Joshua. The mention of Manasseh here highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Joseph that his descendants would become a great people.<p><b>(a tribe of Joseph)</b><br>Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, received a double portion of inheritance through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. This was a special blessing given by Jacob, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>, where Jacob adopts Joseph's sons as his own. The tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim are often collectively referred to as the house of Joseph. This connection to Joseph is significant because Joseph is a type of Christ, having suffered and then risen to a position of power to save his family, paralleling Christ's suffering and resurrection for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>Gaddi son of Susi</b><br>Gaddi is one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. His name, meaning "my fortune" or "fortunate," may reflect the hope and expectation placed on the mission. The mention of his father, Susi, provides a genealogical link, emphasizing the importance of family lineage in Israelite society. Gaddi's role as a spy is crucial, as the report he and the others bring back will influence the Israelites' faith and actions. The mission of the spies is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, testing their trust in God's promise to give them the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after Joseph's firstborn son.
