The donkey's ability to see the angel of the LORD, while Balaam could not, highlights the spiritual blindness of Balaam despite his reputation as a seer. The "angel of the LORD" is often considered a theophany, a manifestation of God Himself, which adds gravity to the situation. This encounter underscores the theme of divine intervention and guidance, even through unexpected means.<p><b>she lay down under Balaam</b><br>The donkey's action of lying down is significant as it demonstrates her submission and recognition of divine authority, contrasting with Balaam's obstinacy. In the cultural context, a donkey was a common mode of transportation, and its refusal to move would have been seen as unusual and frustrating. This act of lying down symbolizes a halt in Balaam's misguided mission, emphasizing the need for humility and obedience to God's will.<p><b>and he became furious and beat her with his staff</b><br>Balaam's reaction of anger and violence reveals his character and lack of spiritual discernment. The staff, a symbol of authority and guidance, is misused here, reflecting Balaam's misguided leadership. This incident parallels other biblical narratives where human anger leads to sin, such as Moses striking the rock in <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of reacting in anger rather than seeking divine understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.
