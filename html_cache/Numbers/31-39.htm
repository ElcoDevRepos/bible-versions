In ancient Near Eastern cultures, donkeys were valuable assets for transportation, agriculture, and trade. This large number signifies the extent of the plunder and the prosperity it brought to the Israelites. The use of donkeys in biblical times is also seen in <a href="/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>, where Pharaoh gives Abram donkeys, among other livestock, as a sign of wealth. The acquisition of such a large number of donkeys underscores the completeness of Israel's victory and God's provision for His people.<p><b>including a tribute to the LORD of 61</b><br>The tribute of 61 donkeys to the LORD represents the portion set aside for God from the spoils of war. This act of giving a tribute is a form of acknowledgment that the victory and the spoils are ultimately from God. It reflects the principle of dedicating the firstfruits or a portion of one's increase to God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>. The specific number, 61, is derived from the total number of donkeys, following the command in <a href="/numbers/31-28.htm">Numbers 31:28-30</a> to give a portion to the LORD. This tribute can be seen as a type of offering, similar to the tithe, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are receiving instructions on how to handle the spoils from their victory over the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, to whom a tribute is given as an acknowledgment of His provision and victory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/donkeys.htm">Donkeys</a></b><br>Part of the livestock taken as spoils, representing wealth and resources.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god's_provision.htm">Acknowledgment of God's Provision</a></b><br>The tribute to the LORD signifies recognition of His role in granting victory and providing resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_in_giving.htm">Obedience in Giving</a></b><br>The Israelites' act of giving a portion of the spoils demonstrates obedience to God's commands, which is a principle applicable to modern-day stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_firstfruits.htm">The Principle of Firstfruits</a></b><br>Giving the first portion to God reflects the principle of firstfruits, teaching us to prioritize God in our finances and resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The collective act of giving a tribute fosters a sense of community and shared worship among the Israelites, reminding us of the importance of communal worship and support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_abundance.htm">Trust in God's Abundance</a></b><br>By giving a portion of their resources, the Israelites show trust in God's continued provision, encouraging us to trust God with our resources.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_31_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 31:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_39_God_s_provision_justice.htm">How does Numbers 31:39 illustrate God's provision and justice for His people?
