The concern here reflects the importance of preserving a family's name and inheritance within the tribal structure. The daughters of Zelophehad, who speak these words, challenge the existing norms by advocating for their father's legacy despite the absence of male heirs. This request highlights the significance of family names in maintaining tribal identity and property rights. The cultural context underscores the patriarchal nature of society, where inheritance laws favored sons, yet this passage begins to address gender equity in inheritance rights. This plea also foreshadows later biblical themes of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which speaks to the equality of all in Christ.<p><b>Give us property among our father&#8217;s brothers.&#8221;</b><br>The daughters' request for property among their father's brothers is a direct appeal for inclusion in the inheritance rights typically reserved for male relatives. This request is significant as it sets a precedent for inheritance laws in Israel, leading to a divine ruling that would allow daughters to inherit if there were no sons, as seen in <a href="/numbers/27-7.htm">Numbers 27:7</a>. This change in law reflects God's justice and care for all members of the community, ensuring that the vulnerable are protected. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ's inclusive kingdom, where all believers, regardless of gender or status, are co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The request also emphasizes the importance of land in Israelite society, as land was not only a source of sustenance but also a symbol of God's promise and blessing to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Manasseh who died without male heirs.

The request assumes that the "brethren" of Zelophehad would receive an inheritance in the promised land, either personally or as represented by their sons; hence it seems clear that Zelophehad was not of the elder generation, which had forfeited all their rights and expectations in Canaan, but of the younger, to whom the inheritance was transferred (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-32</a>). This is confirmed by the consideration that these women were not married until some time after this (<a href="/numbers/36-11.htm">Numbers 36:11</a>; cf. <a href="/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8, 4</a>), and must, therefore, according to the almost invariable custom, have been quite young at this time. It is reasonable to suppose that the heads of separate families to whom the land was distributed would be at this time men of from forty-five to sixty years of age, comprising the elder half of the generation which grew up in the wilderness. Zelophehad would have been among these, but that he was cut off, perhaps in the plague of serpents, or in the plague of the Arboth Mesh, and left only unmarried girls to represent him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/27-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">should the name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;m-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8034.htm">Strong's 8034: </a> </span><span class="str2">A name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of our father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
