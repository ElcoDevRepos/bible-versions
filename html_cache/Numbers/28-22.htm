The choice of a male goat is significant, as it was considered a valuable animal, symbolizing the costliness of sin and the need for a worthy sacrifice. The use of a goat also connects to the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) rituals, where one goat was sacrificed, and another was sent into the wilderness as a scapegoat, symbolizing the removal of sin from the community (<a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7-10</a>).<p><b>as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and to purify the people and the sanctuary. This offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification before God. The sin offering points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>to make atonement for you</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the shedding of blood. In the Old Testament, atonement was a temporary covering of sin, requiring repeated sacrifices. This foreshadows the perfect and final atonement made by Jesus Christ on the cross, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>, where His sacrifice is once for all, providing eternal redemption. The concept of atonement highlights God's holiness and justice, as well as His mercy and grace in providing a means for forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and make atonement for their sins through sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice commanded by God to atone for sins, symbolizing the need for purification and forgiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where sacrifices were made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process of making amends or reparation for sin, which in the Old Testament was achieved through prescribed sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The sin offering in <a href="/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a> underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement.
