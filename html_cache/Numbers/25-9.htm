The plague was a direct consequence of their disobedience to God's commandments, highlighting the seriousness of idolatry and immorality in the eyes of God. This event serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings were contingent upon obedience, and curses followed disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The plague can be seen as a form of divine discipline intended to bring the people back to repentance and faithfulness.<p><b>numbered 24,000.</b><br>The number 24,000 is significant as it underscores the severity of the judgment. This large number indicates the widespread nature of the sin and its impact on the community. In <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>, Paul references this event, noting that 23,000 fell in one day, which may suggest a rounding or a focus on the immediate impact of the plague. The discrepancy in numbers between the Old and New Testament accounts can be understood in light of ancient historiographical practices, where exact numbers were often less critical than the theological or moral lessons conveyed. The number also serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, emphasizing the need for holiness and separation from pagan practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.

It has been supposed that a thousand were put to death by the judges, and that these were not included in St. Paul's enumeration. Presuming, however, that there has been no error in either place on the part of the scribes in recording the numbers, the words "in one day" may account for the apparent discrepancy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were twenty and four thousand.</span> "Fell in one day three and twenty thousand," says St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>). As the Septuagint does not deviate here from the Hebrew, the Apostle must have followed some Rabbinical tradition. It is possible enough that the odd thousand died on some other day than the one of which he speaks, or they may have died by the hands of the judges, and not by the plague. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/25-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but those who died</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1514;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the plague</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1508;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;mag&#183;g&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4046.htm">Strong's 4046: </a> </span><span class="str2">A blow, slaughter, plague, pestilence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">numbered 24,000.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">OT Law: Numbers 25:9 Those who died by the plague were (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/25-8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 25:8"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 25:8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/25-10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 25:10"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 25:10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
