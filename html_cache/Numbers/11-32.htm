This event took place in the wilderness, a setting that highlights their dependence on divine provision. The quail migration is a natural phenomenon, but the timing and abundance here indicate a miraculous intervention. The people's eagerness to gather quail reflects their desperation and lack of trust in God's ongoing provision, a recurring theme in their wilderness journey. This incident parallels the gathering of manna, where God also tested their obedience and reliance on Him.<p><b>No one gathered less than ten homers,</b><br>A homer is a large unit of measurement, approximately 220 liters or 58 gallons. The abundance of quail signifies God's ability to provide beyond human expectation, yet it also serves as a test of the people's restraint and gratitude. The excessive gathering suggests greed and a lack of faith, as they hoarded more than they needed. This mirrors the human tendency to seek security in material abundance rather than in God's promises. The number ten often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, indicating that everyone gathered a full measure.<p><b>and they spread them out all around the camp.</b><br>Spreading the quail around the camp was likely a method of preservation, as the meat needed to be dried to prevent spoilage. This action reflects the practical aspects of life in the wilderness and the need for resourcefulness. However, it also underscores the people's focus on immediate gratification rather than spiritual obedience. The camp, central to Israel's community life, becomes a place of both provision and testing. This scene foreshadows future instances where the Israelites' desires lead them away from God's will, emphasizing the importance of spiritual discipline and trust in divine timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.

Israel&#8217;s relentless gathering echoes the round-the-clock vigilance seen when God first sent manna (<a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores the immediacy of God&#8217;s response to their craving (<a href="/psalms/78-27.htm">Psalm 78:27-29</a>). He did not trickle out a token supply; He poured out a flood, revealing both His power and His intent to test hearts (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-16.htm">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Continuous labor also hints at the people&#8217;s impatience. Instead of pausing to thank the Provider, they rushed to secure the provision&#8212;an attitude that will soon result in judgment (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the next day</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and all the next day &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a>)<p>&#8226; A second full day of gathering highlights the extravagant scale of the miracle. As with the later feeding of the four thousand where baskets of leftovers remained (<a href="/mark/8-8.htm">Mark 8:8-9</a>), God&#8217;s supply far exceeded immediate need.<p>&#8226; Two days of collecting suggest that the quail cloud lingered, confirming Moses&#8217; earlier promise that meat would last &#8220;not one day, or two, or five, or ten, or twenty&#8221; but a full month (<a href="/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The extended timeframe removes any doubt that this was chance migration; it was a divinely scheduled event (<a href="/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people stayed up gathering the quail</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; the people stayed up gathering the quail.&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a>)<p>&#8226; Similar to Ruth gleaning grain from sunrise to sunset (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>), the Israelites worked tirelessly. Yet their motive differed: Ruth gathered in humble faith; Israel gathered in restless craving (<a href="/psalms/106-14.htm">Psalm 106:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;stayed up&#8221; portrays feverish energy. What should have been received with measured gratitude became an obsessive pursuit (<a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God often grants what people insist on, then lets the consequences teach (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one gathered less than ten homers</b><p>&#8220;No one gathered less than ten homers &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a>)<p>&#8226; A &#8220;homer&#8221; is roughly 6 bushels; ten homers equals about 60 bushels&#8212;an astonishing haul for every individual. The bounty rivals Solomon&#8217;s daily provision of grain (<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The uniform minimum (&#8220;no one &#8230; less&#8221;) stresses that God treated all tribes and stations alike, much as manna was distributed equitably (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-15.htm">2 Corinthians 8:15</a> cites <a href="/exodus/16-18.htm">Exodus 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the volume signals overindulgence. Instead of gathering only &#8220;as much as each one needs&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>), they amassed surplus, exposing hearts fixed on flesh rather than on the Giver (<a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they spread them out all around the camp</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and they spread them out all around the camp.&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a>)<p>&#8226; Laying the quail out likely served to dry or cure the meat, paralleling the way Gideon laid fleece on the ground to receive dew (<a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37-38</a>). It was practical but also visual: mountains of quail testified to divine abundance.<p>&#8226; The sight should have stirred worship, as did the altar of twelve stones reminding Israel of God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20-24</a>). Instead, it soon precedes plague (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all around the camp&#8221; reveals that every corner of Israel shared the experience, leaving no excuse for disbelief (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a> records a torrent of divine provision met with unrestrained human appetite. For two full days Israel labored without pause, hauling in no less than sixty bushels per person and carpeting the camp with quail. The episode showcases God&#8217;s limitless power to satisfy, His impartial generosity, and His willingness to let people taste the fruit of their cravings. It also warns that abundance divorced from gratitude leads to judgment. Believers are invited to seek the Giver more than the gift, receive His blessings with measured trust, and remember that true satisfaction is found in obedient fellowship with Him (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26-35</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Ten homers.</span>--The <span class= "ital">homer, </span>which was equal to ten ephahs, or a hundred omers, appears to have contained between five and six bushels, according to the Rabbinists, but according to Josephus about double that quantity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people stood up... next day.</span> A statement which shows us how greedy the people were, and how inordinately eager to supply themselves with an abundance of animal food. They were so afraid of losing any of the birds that they stayed up all night in order to collect them; probably they only ceased gathering and began to cat when the available supply was spent. <span class="cmt_word">Ten homers.</span> It is difficult to calculate the capacity of the homer, especially as it may have varied from age to age. If it contained ten ephahs, as seems to be implied in <a href="/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>, and if the estimate of the Rabbinists (which is less than that of Josephus) be correct that the ephah held nearly four and a half gallons of liquid measure, then half a million of men must have collected more quails apiece than would have filled a 450 gallon tub. No doubt the total number was something enormous, and far above anything that could have been supplied by natural agencies. The gift of quails, like that of manna, was one of the gifts of nature proper to that region Divinely multiplied and extended, so as to show forth in the most striking way the boundless power and beneficence of God. <span class="cmt_word">They spread them all abroad.</span> In order to dry them in the sun, as the Egyptians used to do with fish (Herod., 2:77), and as the South Americans do with beef.
