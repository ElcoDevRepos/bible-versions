His actions consistently reflect his role as a faithful servant and leader of Israel. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, a principle that is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him.</b><br>This highlights the divine authority behind Moses' actions. The LORD's commands are central to the narrative of the Israelites, guiding them through the wilderness and establishing their covenant relationship with God. This obedience to divine command is a precursor to the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who emphasized doing the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).

It shows cause and effect: because God spoke, an action followed.<p>- Scripture often uses a simple connective to highlight swift obedience; compare <a href="/joshua/11-15.htm">Joshua 11:15</a>, where after detailing God&#8217;s commands, the text says, &#8220;So Joshua left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses did</b><p>- Moses&#8217; name is repeated to underscore that the leader himself took action; he did not delegate this moment of obedience.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/7-6.htm">Exodus 7:6</a> records the same pattern: &#8220;Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a> commends Moses as &#8220;faithful as a servant in all God&#8217;s house.&#8221;<p>- By acting personally, Moses models servant&#8211;leadership: he serves first, then expects Israel to follow.<p>- His obedience is consistent, not selective. From the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) to the end of his life (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>), Moses&#8217; characteristic trait is that he &#8220;did&#8221; what God said.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD had commanded him</b><p>- The phrase stresses exactness. Moses didn&#8217;t adjust, delay, or negotiate; he carried out the divine word precisely.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>: &#8220;You must not add to or subtract from it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> warns Saul that partial obedience is disobedience.<p>- The LORD&#8217;s command is the final authority. When Scripture records obedience, it implicitly calls every reader to the same standard. Jesus later affirms this principle: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>- Obedience brings peace and order. Israel&#8217;s grumbling ends when Moses obeys, Aaron&#8217;s staff is displayed, and the people recognize God&#8217;s chosen mediator (<a href="/numbers/17-12.htm">Numbers 17:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11</a> captures the essence of faithful living: God speaks; His servant responds without hesitation. The connective &#8220;So&#8221; ties obedience directly to revelation, &#8220;Moses did&#8221; spotlights personal responsibility, and &#8220;as the LORD had commanded him&#8221; highlights exact, wholehearted submission. The verse reminds believers that true leadership and genuine worship flow from taking God&#8217;s word literally and acting on it immediately, trusting that His commands are both authoritative and good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had commanded him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/17-11.htm">OT Law: Numbers 17:11 Moses did so (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/17-10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 17:10"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 17:10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/17-12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 17:12"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 17:12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
