This phrase indicates the husband's awareness of his wife's vow, which is significant because it implies his responsibility to either affirm or nullify it. The patriarchal structure of the society is evident here, reflecting the broader biblical theme of headship and authority within the family unit, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>.<p><b>but says nothing to her</b><br>The husband's silence is crucial. In the context of <a href="/numbers/30.htm">Numbers 30</a>, silence is tantamount to consent. This reflects a legal principle where inaction or lack of objection is interpreted as agreement. This concept is echoed in other legal contexts within the Bible, such as in the laws of Leviticus, where silence or inaction can imply consent or guilt.<p><b>and does not prohibit her</b><br>The husband's choice not to prohibit his wife's vow underscores his role in either validating or nullifying her commitments. This reflects the biblical principle of authority and responsibility, where the husband has the power to uphold or annul vows. This is similar to the authority given to leaders in the church, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>, where leaders are expected to manage their households well.<p><b>then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the binding nature of vows once they are affirmed, either explicitly or implicitly. Vows in the biblical context are serious commitments made before God, and their fulfillment is a matter of integrity and faithfulness. This is consistent with the broader biblical teaching on the importance of keeping one's word, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>.

When a married woman makes a vow, &#8220;and her husband hears of it,&#8221; the matter immediately becomes a shared concern. Scripture shows that God assigns husbands a listening, discerning role in the home (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing implies attentiveness; the husband is expected to know what spiritual commitments are being made.<p>&#8226; The verse assumes he is present enough in her life to be informed&#8212;echoing the pattern in <a href="/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3&#8211;4</a> where a father similarly hears his daughter&#8217;s vow.<p>&#8226; By hearing, he becomes accountable for the decision that follows (<a href="/numbers/30-15.htm">Numbers 30:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But says nothing to her</b><p>Silence here is not indifference; it is an intentional choice. <a href="/numbers/30-4.htm">Numbers 30:4</a> already established that if a man &#8220;remains silent&#8221; on the day he hears, the vow becomes binding.<p>&#8226; Biblical silence can communicate agreement (<a href="/john/19-10.htm">John 19:10&#8211;11</a>) or acceptance (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; In the flow of the passage, a husband&#8217;s word&#8212;or the lack of it&#8212;carries authority in confirming or canceling the vow.<p>&#8226; His silence therefore signals wholehearted consent, much like Eli&#8217;s silence when Hannah explained her vow (<a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And does not prohibit her</b><p>The verb &#8220;prohibit&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/30-8.htm">Numbers 30:8</a>) pictures a deliberate annulment. If the husband neither speaks up nor forbids, he leaves the vow intact.<p>&#8226; Active restraint is required to nullify a vow; anything less counts as approval (<a href="/numbers/30-8.htm">Numbers 30:8, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; Example: Elkanah deliberately supported Hannah&#8217;s vow and sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/1-23.htm">1 Samuel 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament parallels urge husbands to lead without harshness (<a href="/colossians/3-19.htm">Colossians 3:19</a>) while honoring their wives&#8217; spiritual walk.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand</b><p>The conclusion is straightforward: her commitment is fully valid before God.<p>&#8226; God upholds personal responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the seriousness of vows in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, calling for truthfulness without evasive loopholes.<p>&#8226; By allowing the vow to stand, the husband affirms the household&#8217;s integrity and honors the Lord who &#8220;keeps covenant&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/30-11.htm">Numbers 30:11</a> shows how God weaves individual devotion and marital unity together. A husband who hears a vow, chooses silence, and refrains from forbidding it officially seals that vow. His consent reinforces personal accountability and safeguards harmony in the home. The passage reminds believers that words spoken to God matter, that family leadership carries weight, and that shared faithfulness brings stability to every household.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/30-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and her husband</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
