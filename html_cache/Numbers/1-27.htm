The tribe of Judah holds significant importance throughout biblical history. It is prophesied in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> that the scepter will not depart from Judah, indicating leadership and kingship, which is fulfilled in King David and ultimately in Jesus Christ, who is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>. Judah's territory was located in the southern part of Israel, including Jerusalem, which became the political and spiritual center of the nation.<p><b>numbered 74,600</b><br>The number 74,600 represents the men of military age from the tribe of Judah. This large number indicates Judah's prominence and strength among the tribes. Historically, Judah often played a leading role in Israel's military campaigns and governance. The size of the tribe also foreshadows its future significance, as it becomes the dominant tribe in the southern kingdom of Judah after the division of Israel. This census reflects God's promise to Abraham of numerous descendants and the growth of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>Judah is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.
