Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah, is the patriarch of this tribe. The Levites were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were distributed among the other tribes to perform their priestly functions. This phrase introduces the three main family divisions within the tribe of Levi, each with distinct roles in the service of the Tabernacle.<p><b>Gershon,</b><br>Gershon is the firstborn son of Levi. The Gershonites were responsible for the care of the Tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and hangings. This role highlights the importance of maintaining the sacred space where God dwelled among His people. The name Gershon is thought to mean "exile" or "sojourner," reflecting the transient nature of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The Gershonites' duties are detailed in <a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-28</a>.<p><b>Kohath,</b><br>Kohath is the second son of Levi. The Kohathites had the most prestigious and dangerous duties, as they were responsible for the care of the most sacred objects of the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table, the lampstand, and the altars. These items were to be carried on their shoulders, emphasizing the reverence and care required in handling holy objects. The Kohathites' responsibilities are outlined in <a href="/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4:1-20</a>. The lineage of Kohath is significant as it includes Moses and Aaron, through whom the priestly line is established.<p><b>and Merari.</b><br>Merari is the third son of Levi. The Merarites were tasked with the transportation and maintenance of the Tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This role underscores the importance of the physical structure that housed the presence of God. The name Merari is associated with bitterness or hardship, possibly reflecting the burdensome nature of their duties. The responsibilities of the Merarites are described in <a href="/numbers/4-29.htm">Numbers 4:29-33</a>. The division of labor among the Levite families illustrates the organized and communal approach to worship and service in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>Levi was the third son of Jacob and Leah.

Numbers opens this list by stating matter-of-factly that Levi had sons, underscoring the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to covenant promises transmitted through generations (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14-16</a>).<p>- Scripture often pauses to name descendants so we can trace how God works through families&#8212;think of the careful records in <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/1.htm">1 Chronicles 1-9</a> or the line of Christ in <a href="/bsb/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a>.<p>- More than dry data, these family trees remind us that God&#8217;s plan advances through ordinary households that choose obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Levi</b><p>- Levi, Jacob&#8217;s third son (<a href="/genesis/29-34.htm">Genesis 29:34</a>), became the tribe entrusted with tabernacle service. After the golden-calf incident the Levites rallied to Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26</a>), and the Lord set them apart for ministry (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>).<p>- <a href="/bsb/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a> explains that every firstborn Israelite male originally belonged to God (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>), but He accepted the Levites in their place (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>). The tribe thus serves as a living reminder of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by name</b><p>- God delights in specificity. He doesn&#8217;t speak of an anonymous crowd; He lists individuals. <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> reassures, &#8220;I have called you by name; you are Mine,&#8221; and Jesus says the shepherd &#8220;calls his own sheep by name&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>- Knowing each Levite lineage by name shows that the Lord&#8217;s care drills down to the personal level. No family slips through the cracks of His sovereign attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gershon</b><p>- The Gershonites camped on the west side of the tabernacle and transported its curtains, coverings, and screens (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>; 4:24-26).<p>- Their work involved keeping the visible fabric of worship in good order&#8212;an early picture of how service behind the scenes matters to God just as much as front-line leadership (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10-11</a> highlights varied gifts working together).<p>- Cities such as Golan and Beeshterah later housed Gershonite clans (<a href="/joshua/21-27.htm">Joshua 21:27-33</a>), showing how the Lord provided for those who served Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kohath</b><p>- Kohath&#8217;s descendants carried the most sacred objects&#8212;the ark, table, lampstand, altars, and utensils (<a href="/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a>; 4:4-15).<p>- Because contact with these items was dangerous if mishandled (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>), the duty required reverent precision. This illustrates the holiness of God and the necessity of approaching Him on His terms (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p>- Notably, Amram, a Kohathite, fathered Moses and Aaron (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18-20</a>), linking this line directly to prophetic and priestly leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Merari</b><p>- The Merarites oversaw the structural framework&#8212;boards, bars, pillars, bases (<a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>; 4:29-33).<p>- Their load was heavy, yet it ensured stability. Likewise, believers who strengthen doctrine and support church logistics keep the community from collapsing (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>- Towns such as Jokneam and Rimmon became Merarite homes (<a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34-40</a>), confirming that the Lord does not forget those who shoulder weighty, unseen responsibilities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17</a> spotlights three sons&#8212;not merely as a footnote, but as living proof that God organizes His people with purpose. Gershon reminds us of faithful service in worship&#8217;s fabric, Kohath of reverent proximity to holiness, and Merari of sturdy support.
