Unlike the other spies, Caleb, along with Joshua, brings back a positive report, demonstrating faith in God's promise. The term "servant" signifies a close relationship with God, highlighting Caleb's loyalty and dedication. Caleb's lineage is from the tribe of Judah, which is significant as this tribe is later associated with leadership and kingship in Israel.<p><b>has a different spirit</b><br>This phrase indicates Caleb's unique attitude and perspective compared to the other Israelites. While the majority were fearful and doubted God's promise, Caleb's spirit was characterized by faith, courage, and trust in God. This "different spirit" sets him apart as a model of faithfulness and obedience.<p><b>and has followed Me wholeheartedly</b><br>Caleb's complete devotion to God is emphasized here. "Wholeheartedly" suggests an undivided commitment, contrasting with the wavering faith of the other Israelites. This total dedication is a key theme in the Bible, where God often calls His people to love and serve Him with all their heart, soul, and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<p><b>I will bring him into the land he has entered</b><br>God promises to reward Caleb's faithfulness by allowing him to enter the Promised Land, a privilege denied to the rest of his generation. This promise underscores the biblical principle that faith and obedience lead to blessing. The "land he has entered" refers to Canaan, the land promised to Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>and his descendants will inherit it</b><br>Caleb's faithfulness not only benefits him but also his descendants, illustrating the biblical concept of generational blessing. This promise is fulfilled in <a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-14</a>, where Caleb receives Hebron as his inheritance.

While the majority walked in unbelief, God singles out Caleb as &#8220;My servant,&#8221; the same title given to Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) and later to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>).

Taken in connection with <a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>, and in contrast with <a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6, 30, 38</a>, it has been supposed to point to the interweaving here of two narratives, from the one of which the name of Joshua was intentionally omitted (see the Introduction). The fact, however, is that Joshua is not the only, nor the most remarkable, exception to the general sentence which is not specified here. Moses and Aaron themselves were undoubtedly not included in that sentence at this time, although they afterwards came under the severity of it (see on Deuteronomy 1:37). Eleazar, the priest, was one of those who entered with Joshua (<a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>), and it is vain to argue that he might have been under twenty at the time of the numbering (cf. <a href="/numbers/4-16.htm">Numbers 4:16</a>). There is, indeed, every reason to believe that the whole tribe of Levi were excepted from the punishment, because they were not compromised in the guilt. They had no representative among the spies, nor were they called upon to go up and fight; moreover, they had been steadily loyal to Moses since the matter of the golden calf. But if the <span class="accented">exception</span> of the Levites was taken for granted, and passed without mention, much more might the exception of Joshua. He did not stand by any means in the same position as Caleb and the other spies; he was the "minister" and lieutenant of Moses, whose fortunes were obviously bound up, not with those of his tribe, but with those of his master. If Moses had accepted the Divine offer to make him the head of a new chosen race, no doubt Joshua would have been given to him. His subsequent separation as leader, not of Ephraim, but of Israel, was already anticipated in the singularity, at least, of his position. Caleb, on the other hand, was merely a chieftain of the tribe of Judah, with nothing to distinguish him from the mass of the people but his own good conduct. There is, therefore, nothing perplexing in the fact that Caleb alone is mentioned in this place, and nothing to warrant the assumption of a double narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Another spirit.</span> The spirit which possessed and prompted Caleb was no doubt the Holy Spirit, just as the spirit which moved the rebellion was an evil spirit (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>); but how far any such personality is here attributed to the "spirit" is hard to determine. <span class="cmt_word">Hath followed me fully.</span> Literally, "fulfilled to walk behind me." Caleb treasured up this testimony with natural pride (cf. <a href="/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his seed shall possess it,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a portion of it and in it. No mention is made here of any special heritage, nor is it clear from <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-13</a> that Caleb received any definite promise of Hebron. He spoke indeed of a promise made him, probably at this time, by Moses; but that promise was a very general one. He asked for "this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day;" but he may only have referred to the Divine command first to explore and then to occupy "the mountain," as the nearest portion of the promised land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/14-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;qe&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6118.htm">Strong's 6118: </a> </span><span class="str2">A heel, the last of anything, result, compensation, on account of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
