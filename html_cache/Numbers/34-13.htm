This reflects his role as a mediator between God and His people, similar to how Christ mediates the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). The Israelites, descendants of Jacob, are the chosen people through whom God is working His redemptive plan. This command comes as they are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance</b><br>The use of lots to divide the land signifies God's sovereignty in the distribution, ensuring that each tribe receives its portion according to divine will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The concept of inheritance is significant, as it ties back to the Abrahamic covenant where God promised land to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This inheritance is a type of the eternal inheritance believers receive through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>The LORD has commanded that it be given</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority behind the allocation of the land. It is not merely a human decision but a fulfillment of God's command. This reflects the biblical theme of obedience to God's directives, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).<p><b>To the nine and a half tribes</b><br>The reference to nine and a half tribes is due to the fact that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had already received their inheritance east of the Jordan River (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>). This division highlights the unity and diversity within the people of Israel, as well as God's provision for each tribe. It also foreshadows the unity of believers in Christ, who are diverse yet one body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is conveying God's command regarding the division of the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are about to enter and settle in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nine_and_a_half_tribes.htm">The Nine and a Half Tribes</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Israel that are to receive their inheritance west of the Jordan River.
