Moses, as the intercessor for Israel, demonstrates the role of a mediator, which is a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The urgency in "now" reflects the immediate need for divine intervention.<p><b>may the power of my Lord be magnified</b><br>Moses is asking for God's power to be displayed, not for personal gain, but for the glory of God. This reflects the biblical theme that God's strength is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). The term "Lord" here is a reference to Yahweh, emphasizing a personal relationship and covenant with God. The magnification of God's power is a recurring theme, seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the miracles in the wilderness.<p><b>just as You have declared</b><br>Moses reminds God of His own words, showing the importance of God's promises and faithfulness. This phrase underscores the reliability of God's word, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word does not return void. It also reflects the covenantal relationship where God&#8217;s declarations are binding and trustworthy. Moses is invoking God's past declarations of mercy and forgiveness, as seen earlier in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God describes Himself as compassionate and gracious.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes on behalf of the people after they express doubt and fear about entering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land but are struggling with faith and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is characterized by His power, mercy, and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_paran.htm">The Wilderness of Paran</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are camped when they express their fear and rebellion against entering Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>Moses' prayer demonstrates the importance and power of interceding for others.
