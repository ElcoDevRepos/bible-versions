This group likely included non-Israelites who had joined the exodus, possibly due to witnessing the power of God during the plagues. Their presence among the Israelites often led to discontent and rebellion, as seen here. The "strong craving" indicates a deep-seated desire for the variety of foods they had in Egypt, highlighting a lack of contentment with God's provision of manna. This craving can be seen as a metaphor for the human tendency to long for worldly pleasures rather than spiritual sustenance.<p><b>and again the Israelites wept</b><br>The Israelites' weeping signifies a recurring pattern of dissatisfaction and lack of faith in God's provision. This behavior echoes previous instances of grumbling, such as at the waters of Marah (<a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>) and in the Wilderness of Sin (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). Their tears reflect a spiritual immaturity and a failure to trust in God's plan, despite witnessing His miracles. This weeping can be seen as a lack of gratitude and a focus on temporal desires over eternal promises.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Who will feed us meat?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals a desire for the comforts of Egypt, where they had access to a variety of foods (<a href="/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>). It underscores a lack of faith in God's ability to provide and a yearning for the past, even though it was a time of bondage. The Israelites' demand for meat can be seen as a test of God's patience and a challenge to His authority. This longing for meat foreshadows the provision of quail, which ultimately leads to a divine judgment (<a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31-34</a>). The question also highlights a deeper spiritual issue: a failure to recognize that true satisfaction comes from God alone, a theme echoed in Jesus' teaching about being the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rabble.htm">The Rabble</a></b><br>This term refers to the mixed multitude or non-Israelites who left Egypt with the Israelites.

While God is faithfully providing manna (<a href="/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7&#8211;9</a>), another development is brewing in the camp. Scripture often uses transitional phrases like this to highlight a contrast&#8212;God&#8217;s consistent care versus the people&#8217;s wavering hearts (see <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the rabble among them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rabble&#8221; points to the mixed multitude that left Egypt with Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>).<p>&#8226; These non-Israelite tag-alongs lacked covenant grounding, so their appetites set the tone for discontent.<p>&#8226; Their attitudes became contagious, showing how ungodly influence can infiltrate God&#8217;s people (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had a strong craving for other food</b><p>&#8226; God had given manna&#8212;adequate, daily, miraculous (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Other food&#8221; implies dissatisfaction with God&#8217;s provision and a desire for Egypt&#8217;s menu (<a href="/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Craving becomes idolatry when it overrides gratitude (<a href="/psalms/106-14.htm">Psalm 106:14-15</a>; <a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and again the Israelites wept</b><p>&#8226; This isn&#8217;t sorrow over sin; it&#8217;s self-pity.

This mixed multitude appears to have been very considerable, and they may have become, as the Gibeonites at a later period, servants to the Israelites, as hewers of wood and drawers of water (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-11.htm" title="Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>). It is probable that this mixed multitude may have partaken even more largely than the Israelites of the fish and vegetables of Egypt, and they appear to have instigated the Israelites to repine at the deprivations to which they were exposed in the wilderness. There is no mention in <a href="/exodus/16-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.">Exodus 16:3</a> of weeping, but the same craving after the flesh-pots of Egypt was probably manifested in the same manner in both cases.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span>--The word <span class= "ital">basar, </span>which is rendered <span class= "ital">flesh, </span>seems here to include--it may be to have primary reference <span class= "ital">to--fish. </span>It is used of fish in <a href="/leviticus/11-11.htm" title="They shall be even an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination.">Leviticus 11:11</a>, and it is obvious from <a href="/numbers/11-22.htm" title="Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?">Numbers 11:22</a> that it was understood by Moses in this general signification.

What the nature and the number and the fate of this rabble were is a matter of mere conjecture and of some perplexity. There does not seem any room for them in the regulations laid down for Israel, nor are they mentioned in any other place except at <a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. In <a href="/leviticus/24-10.htm">Leviticus 24:10</a> we read of the son of an Israelitish woman by an Egyptian father, and this might lead us to conjecture that a great part of the "mixed multitude" was the offspring of such left-handed alliances. These half-breeds, according to the general rule in such cases, would follow their mothers; they would be regarded with contempt by the Jews of pure blood, and would accompany the march as hangers-on of the various tribes with which they were connected. As to their fate, it may be probably concluded, from the reason of things and from the absence of any further notice of them, that they found their way back to the slavery and the indulgences of Egypt; they were bound by no such strong restraints and animated by no such national feelings as the true people of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel also wept again.</span> This expression, again (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, used adverbially), would seem to point to some former weeping, and this is generally found in the "murmuring" of which they had been guilty in the desert of Sin (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2, 3</a>). This, however, is unsatisfactory for several reasons: first, because that occurrence was too remote, having been more than a year ago; second, because there is no mention of any "weeping" at that time; third, because the matter of complaint on the two occasions was really quite different: <span class="accented">then</span> they murmured faithlessly at the blank starvation which apparently stared them in the face; <span class="accented">now</span> they weep greedily at the absence of remembered luxuries. It is therefore much more likely that the expression has regard to the "complaining" which had just taken place at Tabeerah. It was indeed wonderful that the punishment then inflicted did not check the sin; wonderful that it burst out again in an aggravated form almost immediately. But such was the obstinacy of this people, that Divine vengeance, which only perhaps affected a few, and only lasted for a brief space, was not sufficient to silence their wicked clamour. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> - Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> - means flesh-meat generally.
