The use of oxen, valuable animals in ancient agrarian societies, signifies the importance and costliness of the offering. Oxen were often used for labor, making them a significant sacrifice. This offering symbolizes reconciliation and communion with God, reflecting the peace and fellowship believers seek with Him.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolize strength and leadership. The number five can represent grace in biblical numerology, suggesting that this offering is an act of grace and favor. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests, linking this offering to themes of dedication and service to God.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. The inclusion of goats in the peace offering highlights the need for purification and atonement before fellowship with God can be fully realized. The number five again emphasizes grace, suggesting that God's grace covers the sins of the people.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. They are often seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. The repetition of the number five underscores the theme of grace and divine favor.<p><b>This was the offering of Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.</b><br>Shelumiel, whose name means "God is my peace," was the leader of the tribe of Simeon. His offering represents the tribe's dedication and desire for peace with God. Zurishaddai, meaning "my rock is the Almighty," reflects the strength and foundation found in God. This lineage emphasizes the importance of faith and reliance on God as the source of peace and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nashon.htm">Nashon</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Judah, who brought the offering described in this verse.

Peace offerings celebrated restored relationship&#8212;God had drawn near, sins were covered, and now the worshiper enjoyed a shared meal in His presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>). Just as Gideon built an altar called &#8220;The LORD Is Peace&#8221; after meeting the Angel of YHWH (<a href="/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24</a>), Shelumiel&#8217;s offering proclaims gratitude and communion. New-covenant believers see in these sacrifices a foreshadowing of Christ who &#8220;Himself is our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two oxen</b><p>Oxen symbolized strength, wealth, and service (<a href="/proverbs/14-4.htm">Proverbs 14:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>). In sacrifice they represented substantial cost and wholehearted surrender (<a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13-21</a>). By bringing two, Shelumiel demonstrates generosity and doubles the expression of dedication&#8212;much like David who refused to offer &#8220;burnt offerings that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). The picture anticipates the greater cost paid at Calvary (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five rams</b><p>Rams featured prominently in priestly ordination (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-26</a>) and in the substitute provided for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). Their horns later became the trumpets announcing God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). Offering five underscores the theme of grace often linked with the number five in Scripture (e.g., five loaves feeding thousands, <a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-20</a>). Shelumiel&#8217;s five rams broadcast confidence that God&#8217;s grace empowers consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five male goats</b><p>Goats were central to sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-28</a>) and to the Day of Atonement ritual (<a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8-10</a>). By presenting five, Shelumiel acknowledges both personal and tribal guilt and seeks cleansing. The abundance echoes Paul&#8217;s assurance that &#8220;where sin increased, grace abounded all the more&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five male lambs a year old</b><p>Year-old lambs were prime, flawless, and full of life (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). They pointed forward to &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Offering five emphasizes completeness and celebration; fellowship with God overflows into joyful worship, reminiscent of the shepherds&#8217; praise when they met the newborn Savior (<a href="/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai</b><p><a href="/numbers/1-6.htm">Numbers 1:6 and 2</a>:12 identify Shelumiel as the chief of the tribe of Simeon. Simeon had a violent past (<a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; 49:5-7), yet his prince now brings a lavish gift at the dedication of the tabernacle. Grace is restoring a troubled lineage, mirroring how Christ redeems every background (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>). &#8220;Zurishaddai&#8221; means &#8220;My Rock is the Almighty,&#8221; quietly reminding us that stable worship springs from trusting the unmovable God (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-41.htm">Numbers 7:41</a> records Shelumiel&#8217;s portion of the tabernacle dedication offerings. Each element&#8212;peace offering, two oxen, five rams, five goats, five lambs&#8212;highlights fellowship, costly devotion, consecration, atonement, and joyful gratitude. The verse shows a once-wayward tribe publicly celebrating restored relationship with God, prefiguring the perfect peace, forgiveness, and communion secured for us through Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and a peace offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun -
