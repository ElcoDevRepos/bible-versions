In the biblical context, God often uses natural elements to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and the calming of the storm by Jesus (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). The wind here is a divine instrument, emphasizing that the provision of quail is a direct response to the Israelites' complaints about their diet in the wilderness.<p><b>drove in quail from the sea</b><br>Quail are migratory birds, and their appearance in the Sinai Peninsula is consistent with their natural migration patterns. The "sea" likely refers to the Gulf of Aqaba or the Mediterranean Sea. Historically, quail migrations occur in the spring and fall, and they often fly low and become exhausted, making them easy to catch. This event is reminiscent of God's provision of quail in <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>, demonstrating His continued care and provision for His people despite their grumbling.<p><b>and brought them near the camp</b><br>The quail were brought directly to the Israelites' camp, signifying God's direct intervention and provision. This mirrors the miraculous provision of manna, where God provided sustenance directly to His people. The proximity of the quail to the camp underscores the ease with which the Israelites could gather them, highlighting God's abundant provision.<p><b>about two cubits above the surface of the ground</b><br>A cubit is approximately 18 inches, so two cubits would be about three feet. This detail suggests that the quail were flying low or were piled up to this height, making them easily accessible. The specific measurement indicates the abundance of the quail, fulfilling God's promise to provide meat for the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/11-18.htm">Numbers 11:18-20</a>).<p><b>for a day&#8217;s journey in every direction around the camp</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the vastness of the provision. A day's journey in biblical terms is roughly 20 miles, indicating that the quail covered a large area around the camp. This abundance serves as a testament to God's ability to provide beyond human expectation, paralleling the miraculous feeding of the 5,000 by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where a small amount of food was multiplied to feed a multitude.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who responds to the Israelites' complaints by providing quail.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are journeying through the wilderness and express dissatisfaction with their provisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of the Israelites' journey, representing both physical and spiritual challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/q/quail.htm">Quail</a></b><br>The birds provided by God as a response to the Israelites' craving for meat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wind.htm">The Wind</a></b><br>The divine instrument used by God to bring the quail to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God is attentive to the needs and desires of His people, even when they express them in a sinful manner.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>The LORD uses natural elements (wind) to accomplish His purposes, demonstrating His control over creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_discontent.htm">Human Discontent</a></b><br>The Israelites' dissatisfaction with God's provision serves as a warning against ingratitude and a lack of trust in God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_complaining.htm">Consequences of Complaining</a></b><br>The account highlights the dangers of complaining against God, as it can lead to divine discipline.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>While God provides for physical needs, the ultimate fulfillment comes from spiritual sustenance, as seen in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_11_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 11:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/God_s_power_faith_in_Num_11_31.htm">How does God's provision in Numbers 11:31 demonstrate His power and faithfulness?

Quails commonly fly low, and when wearied with a long flight might fly only about breast-high. On the other hand, the more obvious interpretation of the words is that the quails were spread over the ground, and covered it in some places to the height of two cubits. They were probably taken and killed immediately on their descent, as the following verse seems to indicate, and then spread out and dried and hardened in the sun. Some think that the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">quails </span>denotes <span class= "ital">cranes.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wind from the Lord.</span> A wind Divinely sent for this purpose. In <a href="/psalms/78-26.htm">Psalm 78:26</a> it is said to have been a wind from the east and south, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a wind blowing up the Red Sea and across the Gulf of <span class="cmt_word">Akabah. And brought quails from the sea.</span> On the "quails" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">salvim</span> - probably the common quail) see <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>. The Septuagint has in both places <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "the quail-mother," the sense of which is uncertain. These birds, which migrate in spring in vast numbers, came from the sea, but it does not follow that the camp was near the sea. They may have been following up the Gulf of Akabah, and been swept far inland by the violence of the gale. <span class="cmt_word">Let them fall</span> <span class="cmt_word">by the camp.</span> Rather, "threw them down on the camp." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. Either the sudden cessation of the gale, or a violent eddying of the wind, threw the exhausted birds in myriads upon the camp (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits high upon the face of the</span> earth. The word "high" is not in the original, but it probably gives the true meaning. The Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, is somewhat uncertain. The Targums assert that the quails "flew upon the face of the ground, at a height of two cubits;" and this is followed by the Vulgate ("<span class="accented">volabant in acre duobus cubitis altiludine super terram"</span>) and by many commentators. This idea, however, although suggested by the actual habits of the bird, and adopted in order to avoid the obvious difficulty of the statement, is inconsistent with the expressions used here and in <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. If the birds were "thrown" upon the camp, or "rained" upon it like sand, they could not have been flying steadily forward a few feet above the ground. It is certainly impossible to take the statement literally, for such a mass of birds would have been perfectly unmanageable; but if we suppose that they were drifted by the wind into heaps, which in places reached the height of two cubits, that will satisfy the exigencies of the text: anything like a uniform depth would be the last thing to be expected under the circumstances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a wind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
