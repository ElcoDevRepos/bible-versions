This war is a divine retribution for Midian's role in seducing Israel away from God. The Midianites were a nomadic people, often interacting with Israel, sometimes as allies, as seen with Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, a Midianite priest. This war signifies a break from any previous peaceful relations.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine mandate behind the military action. It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God directly guides national decisions. The command to wage war is not a human initiative but a fulfillment of divine justice. This obedience to God's command is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, emphasizing the importance of following divine instructions precisely.<p><b>and they killed every male</b><br>The complete destruction of the male population is indicative of the totality of the judgment against Midian. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, the killing of males was a common practice to prevent future retaliation and to weaken the enemy's societal structure. This act also serves as a deterrent to other nations that might lead Israel into sin. Theologically, it reflects the seriousness of sin and the lengths to which God will go to preserve the holiness of His people. This action can be compared to other instances of divine judgment, such as the flood in Genesis or the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received direct commands from God regarding the actions against Midian.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A region and people who were adversaries of Israel.
