The emphasis on "deadly object" suggests intent or potential for harm. In biblical law, the material of the weapon is significant, as it distinguishes between accidental harm and premeditated murder. The use of wood, a common material, implies accessibility and the potential for everyday objects to become instruments of violence.<p><b>and he strikes and kills another</b><br>The act of striking leading to death highlights the severity of the action. In the context of the Mosaic Law, this phrase underscores the principle of life being sacred and the seriousness of taking a life. The intentionality of the act is crucial, as it differentiates between murder and manslaughter. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and the protection of human life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, which states that whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed.<p><b>he is a murderer</b><br>This declaration identifies the individual as a murderer, emphasizing the moral and legal culpability of the act. In the ancient Israelite legal system, murder was a grave offense against both God and community. The term "murderer" is used to denote someone who has unlawfully taken a life, contrasting with accidental killing, which had different legal consequences and provisions for refuge (<a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11-15</a>).<p><b>the murderer must surely be put to death</b><br>This mandate reflects the principle of retributive justice, often summarized as "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). The death penalty for murder underscores the value of human life and the need for justice. It also serves as a deterrent against future violence. This command is part of the covenantal law given to Israel, highlighting the seriousness with which God views the sanctity of life. Theologically, it points to the ultimate justice fulfilled in Christ, who bore the penalty for sin, offering redemption and life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Numbers were given, as they were preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cities_of_refuge.htm">The Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated places where someone who killed another unintentionally could flee for safety until a trial could be held.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_murderer.htm">The Murderer</a></b><br>The individual who intentionally kills another person with a deadly object, such as a stone.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_avenger_of_blood.htm">The Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member of the victim who had the right to pursue justice for the murder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>This passage underscores the value God places on human life and the seriousness of taking it unlawfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intent_matters.htm">Intent Matters</a></b><br>The distinction between murder and manslaughter highlights the importance of intent in God's justice system.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_mercy.htm">Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While justice is served through the death penalty for murder, the provision of cities of refuge shows God's mercy for those who kill unintentionally.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The community plays a crucial role in upholding justice and providing protection, reflecting the importance of communal responsibility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_attitude.htm">Heart Attitude</a></b><br>Jesus' teaching in the New Testament calls believers to examine their hearts, as anger and hatred can lead to sin.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_35_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 35:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_35_18_Value_of_life.htm">How does Numbers 35:18 emphasize the value of human life in God's eyes?
