They are often associated with Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, who was a priest of Midian. This connection suggests a shared history and possibly shared religious practices with the Israelites. The Kenites' presence in the narrative highlights the diverse groups interacting with Israel during their wilderness journey. The act of lifting up an oracle indicates a divine message or prophecy, suggesting that Balaam, the speaker, is conveying a message from God concerning the Kenites.<p><b>&#8220;Your dwelling place is secure,</b><br>The phrase suggests stability and safety for the Kenites. Historically, the Kenites were known for their metalworking skills, which may have contributed to their economic stability and security. The assurance of a secure dwelling place could also imply divine favor or protection, possibly due to their association with the Israelites. This security contrasts with the often tumultuous existence of other nomadic tribes in the region.<p><b>and your nest is set in a cliff.</b><br>This imagery of a nest set in a cliff suggests a strong, defensible position, likely referring to the Kenites' geographical location. Cliffs and high places were considered strategic for defense in ancient times, providing natural fortification against enemies. The metaphor of a nest also implies care and nurturing, indicating that the Kenites' position is not only secure but also a place of growth and sustenance.

The Kenites are included amongst the tribes whose country Abraham's descendants were to possess (<a href="/genesis/15-19.htm" title="The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,">Genesis 15:19</a>). A portion of this tribe, however (for there is no evidence that the Canaanitish and the Midianitish Kenites had a different origin), joined the Israelites, and settled on the southern border of Judah (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>). If the Authorised Version of these verses be adopted, it is reasonable to conclude that the Kenites to whom Balaam's prophecy referred must have been included amongst the enemies of Israel, whose destruction, in common with their other foes, is here predicted. It is obvious that this interpretation is open to two serious objections:--(1) that the natural reference of the words "carry thee away captive" is to the Kenites, not to the Israelites; and (2) that as the later history, as well as the Book of Numbers, makes mention only of those Kenites who allied themselves with the Israelites, we should naturally expect that in accordance with the promise which was given to Hobab by Moses (<a href="/numbers/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.">Numbers 10:29</a>), the Kenites should be distinguished from the enemies of Israel, and be exempted from the destruction with which they were threatened. Another rendering of <a href="/numbers/24-22.htm" title="Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.">Numbers 24:22</a>, and one which appears to be more agreeable to the context in which it stands, is the following:--"For surely the Kenites shall not be destroyed until Asshur shall carry thee into captivity." This version has the support of the Targum of Palestine and other authorities. It is true that there is no express record of the fulfilment of this prophecy, but it is not probable that the Assyrians spared the Kenites who were settled amongst the Israelites; and we know from <a href="/jeremiah/35-11.htm" title="But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 35:11</a> that after the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar, the Rechabites, who were of the Kenite race (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a>), came to Jerusalem for fear of the armies of the Chaldeans and Syrians. If <span class= "ital">Asshur </span>denotes in this place <span class= "ital">the Assyrians </span>in the later acceptation of the term, it must be remembered that one branch of the Kenites settled in Naphtali, near Kadesh (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Judges 4:11</a>). <span class= "ital">Asshur, </span>however, appears to be used in a wider sense, so as to include all the nations which proceeded from it (see <a href="/numbers/24-24.htm" title="And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.">Numbers 24:24</a>). Even the Persian king is called, as Keil has observed, King of Asshur (<a href="/ezra/6-22.htm" title="And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.">Ezra 6:22</a>). If this interpretation of the text be received, the antithesis between the doom of the Amalekites and the deliverance of the Kenites exactly corresponds to the attitude assumed by those tribes respectively in regard to Israel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He looked on the Kenites.</span> This <span class="accented">mashal</span> is excessively obscure, for both the subject of it and the drift of it are disputed. On the one hand, the Kenites are mentioned among the Canaanitish tribes that were to be dispossessed, in Gem 15:19; on the other, they are identified with the Midianitish tribe to which Hobab and Raguel belonged, in <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, and apparently in <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a> (see on Numbers 10:29). It has been supposed that the friendly Kenites had by this time loft the camp of Israel and established themselves by conquest in the south of Canaan, and even that they had occupied the territory and taken the name of the original Kenites of <a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>. This, however, is a mere conjecture, and a very improbable one. That a weak tribe like that of Hobab should have done what Israel had not dared to do, and settled themselves by force of arms in Southern Palestine, and, further, that they should be already known by the name of those whom they had destroyed, is extremely unlikely, and is inconsistent with the statement in <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</span> Rather, "and thy nest laid (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) upon a rock." We do not know where the Kenites dwelt, and therefore we cannot tell whether this expression is to be understood literally or figuratively. If the Canaanitish tribe is here spoken of, it is very likely they had their residence in some strong mountain fastness, but if the Midianitish tribe, then there is no reason to suppose that they had crossed the Jordan at all In that case the "nest" must be wholly figurative, and must refer to that strong confidence which they placed in the protection of the God of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next he saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
