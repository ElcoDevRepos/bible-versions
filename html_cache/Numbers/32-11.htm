In the context of <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, the Israelites had repeatedly shown a lack of faith and obedience, particularly during the incident of the spies in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. The phrase "wholeheartedly" suggests a total commitment, which was lacking in the generation that left Egypt. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to love God with all their heart, soul, and strength. The failure to follow God wholeheartedly is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to consequences for the Israelites.<p><b>not one of the men twenty years of age or older</b><br>This specifies the age of accountability for those who were held responsible for the rebellion and lack of faith. The age of twenty was significant in Israelite culture, often marking the age when men were considered mature enough for military service (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). This age distinction underscores the seriousness of their rebellion and the resulting judgment. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and obedience from a young age.<p><b>who came out of Egypt</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israelite history where God delivered His people from slavery in Egypt. The generation that experienced this miraculous deliverance was expected to trust and obey God, yet they repeatedly failed to do so. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Bible as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12-16</a>.<p><b>will see the land that I swore to give</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's promise and the conditional nature of its fulfillment based on obedience. The land, often referred to as the Promised Land, was a central element of God's covenant with the patriarchs. The failure of the Exodus generation to enter the land serves as a warning about the consequences of disobedience and unbelief. This theme is reiterated in <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>, where the author warns believers not to harden their hearts as the Israelites did.<p><b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;</b><br>These patriarchs are central figures in the biblical narrative, representing the covenantal promises of God. The land promise was first given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> and reaffirmed to Isaac and Jacob in <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a> and <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>, respectively. The mention of these patriarchs underscores the continuity of God's promises and His faithfulness across generations. It also highlights the importance of faith, as Abraham is often cited as a model of faith in passages like <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicated God's commands and judgments to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, symbolizing God's deliverance and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites' lack of faith and disobedience, particularly the incident of the spies in <a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, which led to God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wholehearted_devotion.htm">Wholehearted Devotion</a></b><br>God desires complete commitment from His people.
