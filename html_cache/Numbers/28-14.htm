A "hin" is an ancient Hebrew unit of liquid measure, approximately equivalent to 3.5 liters or 0.92 gallons. The specification of "half a hin" for each bull indicates the significant value and importance of the offering, as bulls were considered the most valuable of sacrificial animals. This offering reflects the abundance and richness of God's provision and the worshiper's gratitude. The use of wine, a symbol of joy and celebration, underscores the celebratory nature of worship and the acknowledgment of God's blessings.<p><b>a third of a hin with the ram</b><br>The ram, often associated with leadership and strength, requires a lesser amount of wine, "a third of a hin," compared to the bull. This reflects the hierarchical structure of sacrificial offerings, where the value and significance of the animal determine the quantity of the accompanying drink offering. The ram's offering is still substantial, indicating its importance in the sacrificial system. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who fulfills and surpasses all Old Testament sacrifices.<p><b>and a quarter hin with each lamb</b><br>The lamb, a common sacrificial animal, requires "a quarter hin" of wine, the smallest measure among the specified offerings. This reflects the lamb's role as a more frequent and accessible offering for the people. The lamb is a significant type of Christ, who is referred to as the Lamb of God in the New Testament (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The lamb's sacrifice points to the innocence and purity of Christ, who was sacrificed for the sins of humanity. The drink offering accompanying the lamb highlights the completeness of the sacrifice and the joy of redemption.<p><b>This is the monthly burnt offering</b><br>The monthly burnt offering signifies a regular, ongoing commitment to worship and obedience to God. Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God's will. This regularity emphasizes the importance of consistent worship and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over time and seasons. It serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, requiring continual renewal and devotion.<p><b>to be made at each new moon throughout the year</b><br>The new moon marked the beginning of the Hebrew month and was a time of renewal and reflection. Offering sacrifices at the new moon aligns with the biblical theme of new beginnings and God's faithfulness in providing for His people. This practice underscores the cyclical nature of worship and the need for regular spiritual renewal. The new moon offerings are a reminder of God's creation order and His control over time, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of time in Christ's return. The regularity of these offerings throughout the year highlights the perpetual nature of God's covenant and the ongoing need for atonement and worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these instructions to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were to bring their offerings and sacrifices, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices instituted by God for the Israelites, which included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/drink_offering.htm">Drink Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering involving wine, which was poured out as part of the sacrificial rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Understanding the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The sacrificial system was a means for the Israelites to maintain a right relationship with God.

The wine is poured out, symbolizing joyous fellowship and total surrender&#8212;later echoed when Paul says, &#8220;I am already being poured out like a drink offering&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>). Each new-moon service in <a href="/numbers/28-14.htm">Numbers 28:14</a> is therefore not a dry ritual; it is a living statement that God&#8217;s people gladly give back what He has first provided.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Half a hin of wine with each bull</b><p>A hin is roughly six quarts; &#8220;half a hin&#8221; (about three quarts) accompanies the largest animal. God sets the measure, tying the generosity of the drink offering to the size of the burnt offering (compare <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>). In the same way, the one who has been entrusted with much is expected to present much (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>), reminding worshipers that scale matters in stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A third of a hin with the ram</b><p>The ram stands between the bull and the lamb in size and significance. Its proportionate offering&#8212;&#8220;a third of a hin&#8221;&#8212;shows that worship is never one-size-fits-all; God prescribes what is right for each circumstance (<a href="/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6&#8211;7</a>). Precision guards against both stinginess and excess, keeping devotion anchored in obedience rather than personal whim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A quarter hin with each lamb</b><p>Even the smallest animal is not overlooked. A &#8220;quarter hin&#8221; (about one and a half quarts) still costs something, demonstrating that every person&#8212;rich or poor, powerful or humble&#8212;has a part to play (<a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>). The widow&#8217;s two mites are as precious as the rich man&#8217;s larger gifts when both are offered in faith (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41&#8211;44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the monthly burnt offering</b><p>Burnt offerings are wholly consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3&#8211;9</a>), portraying complete consecration. By tying the drink offering to the burnt offering each month, the Lord reinforces that wholehearted surrender and joyful fellowship always belong together (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To be made at each new moon</b><p>The new moon marked the start of Israel&#8217;s calendar months (<a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>). Setting worship at the very beginning of each cycle ensured that every fresh start was dedicated to God (<a href="/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>). Though believers today are not bound to observe lunar festivals (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>), the principle remains: first things&#8212;time, income, decisions&#8212;belong to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Throughout the year</b><p>God commands regularity, not occasional enthusiasm. Just as the manna fell daily (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>) and the lamp in the tabernacle burned continually (<a href="/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>), these offerings keep faith from drifting into sporadic duty. The constancy of worship mirrors the constancy of the One worshiped (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/28-14.htm">Numbers 28:14</a> prescribes precise, proportionate drink offerings&#8212;half, third, and quarter hins&#8212;paired with bulls, rams, and lambs at every new moon. The passage teaches that true worship is joyful, obedient, proportionate, inclusive, and regular. By anchoring each month in sacrifice and celebration, God invites His people into continual, wholehearted fellowship with Himself all year long.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/28-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their drink offerings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nis&#183;k&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
