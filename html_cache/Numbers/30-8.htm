This phrase reflects the cultural context where a husband had authority over his wife's decisions, including vows. The husband's ability to prohibit a vow underscores the importance of family unity and the husband's role in spiritual leadership. This authority is also seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, where the husband is described as the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.<p><b>he nullifies the vow that binds her or the rash promise she has made</b><br>The concept of vows was significant in Israelite culture, as vows were considered binding commitments made before God. A vow or promise, once made, was expected to be fulfilled (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). However, this passage provides a mechanism for nullification, recognizing human fallibility and the potential for rash decisions. The husband's intervention serves as a safeguard against impulsive commitments that could have negative consequences for the family.<p><b>and the LORD will absolve her</b><br>This phrase highlights God's mercy and understanding of human limitations. The absolution by the LORD indicates divine forgiveness and release from the obligation of the vow. It reflects the principle that God values the intentions of the heart and provides grace in situations where human judgment may falter. This is consistent with the broader biblical theme of God's willingness to forgive and restore, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes transgressions from His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living under a covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The male spouse who has the authority to confirm or nullify his wife's vows according to the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>The female spouse who may make vows or pledges, subject to her husband's authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who establishes the laws and provides the means for release from vows.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority_in_marriage.htm">Understanding Authority in Marriage</a></b><br>The passage highlights the biblical principle of headship within marriage, where the husband has a role in guiding and protecting his family, including decisions about vows.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_vows.htm">The Importance of Vows</a></b><br>Vows are serious commitments before God.
