This event is significant as it led to a plague among the Israelites, which was only stopped by the zealous action of Phinehas. The act of naming the individual highlights the personal responsibility and the seriousness of the sin. It also serves as a historical record, emphasizing the importance of accountability within the community of Israel.<p><b>was Zimri son of Salu</b><br>Zimri is identified by his lineage, which was a common practice in ancient Israel to establish identity and social standing. Being the son of Salu, Zimri's actions would have brought shame not only upon himself but also upon his family and tribe. This highlights the communal nature of sin and its consequences in the Israelite society. The naming of Zimri serves as a warning against idolatry and immorality, which were constant temptations for Israel as they interacted with surrounding nations.<p><b>the leader of a Simeonite family</b><br>Zimri's position as a leader within the tribe of Simeon underscores the gravity of his sin. Leaders were expected to set an example for others, and his failure to do so had dire consequences. This reflects the biblical principle that those in positions of authority bear greater responsibility (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>). The tribe of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, had its own unique history and challenges, and this incident would have been a significant blemish on their record. The mention of his leadership role also serves to illustrate the widespread nature of the sin at Peor, affecting even those in high positions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>An Israelite man, identified as the son of Salu and a leader of a Simeonite family.
