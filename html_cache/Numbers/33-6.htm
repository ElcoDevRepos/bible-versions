Succoth, meaning "booths" or "temporary shelters," reflects the transient nature of their journey and reliance on God's provision. This departure fulfills God's promise to deliver His people from bondage, as seen in <a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>. The journey from Succoth also prefigures the Christian journey of faith, leaving behind the bondage of sin.<p><b>and camped at Etham</b><br>Etham is described as being on the edge of the wilderness, indicating a transition from the settled land of Egypt to the desolate wilderness. This location represents a boundary between the known and the unknown, a place of preparation for the challenges ahead. Etham's exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the eastern border of Egypt. The Israelites' encampment here signifies a pause to gather strength and faith before entering the wilderness, a theme echoed in the Christian life as believers prepare for spiritual battles. The stop at Etham also highlights God's guidance, as He led them with a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20-22</a>).<p><b>on the edge of the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing, purification, and reliance on God. It is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's people are often led into the wilderness to be refined and to learn dependence on Him. This setting foreshadows the 40 years the Israelites would spend wandering due to their disobedience and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The wilderness journey is also a type of Christ's own time in the wilderness, where He was tempted by Satan but remained obedient to God (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). For believers, the wilderness symbolizes the trials and growth experienced in the Christian walk, emphasizing trust in God's provision and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/succoth.htm">Succoth</a></b><br>The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Rameses in Egypt.
