In the context of <a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a>, this follows the incident where Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, leading to Miriam's leprosy and subsequent healing. This transition marks a return to the journey of the Israelites after a period of divine discipline and restoration.<p><b>the people set out from Hazeroth</b><br>Hazeroth is one of the stations in the wilderness where the Israelites camped during their exodus from Egypt. It is mentioned in <a href="/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35 and 33</a>:17. The departure from Hazeroth signifies a continuation of their journey towards the Promised Land. This movement is part of the larger narrative of the Israelites' 40-year journey through the wilderness, which serves as a period of testing and preparation.<p><b>and camped in the Wilderness of Paran</b><br>The Wilderness of Paran is a significant location in the biblical narrative. It is a large desert area in the Sinai Peninsula, often associated with the region where the Israelites spent a considerable amount of time during their wanderings. Paran is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a> as the place where Ishmael settled. It is also the location from which the spies were sent to explore Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a>). The wilderness represents both physical and spiritual challenges, as well as opportunities for growth and reliance on God. The movement to Paran is a step closer to the fulfillment of God's promise to bring the Israelites into the land of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.

Probably it is intended to mark the fact that they were still within the limits of Paran, although on the very verge of their promised laud. In the list of stations given in chapter Numbers 33, it is said (verse 18), "They departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah." This is with some probability identified with the Wady Redemat, which opens front the mountain mass of the Azazimat into the singular plain of Kudes, or Kadesh, the scene of the decisive events which followed. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/12-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After that,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1435;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
