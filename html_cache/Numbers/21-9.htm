The use of bronze, a durable metal, signifies judgment and endurance. The serpent, typically a symbol of sin and evil, here represents the sin of the people and the consequences of their rebellion. This act of crafting a bronze snake is a unique instance of God using a symbol of sin as a means of deliverance, foreshadowing the redemptive work of Christ.<p><b>and mounted it on a pole.</b><br>The pole elevates the bronze snake, making it visible to all who are afflicted. This act of lifting up is significant, as it prefigures the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was lifted up on the cross for the salvation of humanity. The pole serves as a focal point for the Israelites' faith and obedience, requiring them to look upon it for healing. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that faith in Christ's sacrifice is necessary for spiritual healing and salvation.<p><b>If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake,</b><br>The condition for healing was simple: to look at the bronze snake. This act of looking signifies faith and trust in God's provision for healing. It required the Israelites to acknowledge their sin and the means of their deliverance. This parallels the call to faith in the New Testament, where belief in Jesus Christ is the means of receiving eternal life. The bitten individuals represent humanity, afflicted by sin and in need of divine intervention.<p><b>he would live.</b><br>The promise of life upon looking at the bronze snake underscores God's mercy and the power of faith. This physical healing is a type of the spiritual life offered through Christ. Just as the Israelites were saved from physical death by looking at the bronze serpent, believers are saved from spiritual death by looking to Christ in faith. This passage is directly referenced in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>, where Jesus explains that just as Moses lifted up the serpent, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes may have eternal life in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
