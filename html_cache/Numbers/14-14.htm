The "inhabitants of this land" likely refers to the Canaanites and other peoples living in the region. The Israelites' journey and their relationship with God were closely watched by neighboring nations, which is evident in later biblical accounts where the fear of Israel's God spreads among the nations (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>They have already heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people,</b><br>The presence of God among the Israelites was a well-known fact, as demonstrated by the miraculous events during the Exodus. This divine presence set Israel apart from other nations and was a source of both fear and respect. The concept of God dwelling among His people is a recurring theme in the Bible, ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament with the incarnation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>that You, O LORD, have been seen face to face,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unique relationship between God and Israel, where God revealed Himself in a direct and personal way. While Moses is specifically noted for speaking with God "face to face" (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>), this expression here underscores the intimate and direct communication between God and His chosen people. It foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><b>that Your cloud stands over them,</b><br>The cloud represents God's guidance and protection over Israel. This cloud, known as the Shekinah glory, was a visible manifestation of God's presence. It provided shade and direction during their wilderness journey. The cloud's presence is a type of Christ, who provides spiritual guidance and protection to believers (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</b><br>The pillars of cloud and fire were miraculous signs of God's leadership and care for Israel. The cloud by day and fire by night ensured that the Israelites could travel safely and confidently, knowing God was with them. This divine guidance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus promises the Holy Spirit to lead and guide believers (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The pillars also symbolize God's unchanging presence, providing light and direction in both the literal and spiritual darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, interceding on behalf of the people to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are in the wilderness after being delivered from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is present with His people in a visible and powerful way.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are journeying towards.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pillar_of_cloud_and_fire.htm">The Pillar of Cloud and Fire</a></b><br>Manifestations of God's presence and guidance for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_is_constant.htm">God's Presence is Constant</a></b><br>Just as God was visibly present with the Israelites, He is with us today through the Holy Spirit.
