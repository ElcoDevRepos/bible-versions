Asher's name means "happy" or "blessed," reflecting Leah's joy at his birth (<a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>). The tribe was known for its abundance and prosperity, as prophesied by Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, where Asher is described as having rich food and providing royal delicacies. Geographically, the territory allotted to Asher was located in the fertile region along the Mediterranean coast, which contributed to its prosperity.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization of the tribes into clans and families was crucial for maintaining order and structure within the nation of Israel. This genealogical record-keeping ensured that each tribe's inheritance and responsibilities were clearly defined. The emphasis on clans and families highlights the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society, as well as the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>Counting the names of all those</b><br>The act of counting or taking a census was significant in the context of the Israelites' journey. It was a means of organizing the people for military and administrative purposes. This census was commanded by God (<a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1:1-2</a>) and was not merely a human initiative. It demonstrated God's sovereignty and His interest in the details of His people's lives. The census also served as a reminder of God's faithfulness in multiplying the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>Twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was considered the age of maturity and responsibility in Israelite culture. It was the age at which men were eligible for military service and other civic duties. This age requirement underscores the importance of readiness and capability in serving the community and fulfilling God's purposes. It also reflects the cultural understanding of adulthood and the transition from youth to full participation in the life of the nation.<p><b>Who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite society, especially as they prepared to enter and conquer the Promised Land. The ability to serve in the army was not only a matter of physical capability but also of spiritual readiness, as the battles they faced were often seen as divinely ordained. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the divine warrior who fights on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). It also foreshadows the spiritual warfare that believers are called to engage in, as described in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant.
