The land in question is Canaan, the Promised Land, which God had assured to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The exploration of the land is a step of faith and obedience, as the Israelites are on the brink of entering a territory that has been divinely promised to them. The land's characteristics are crucial for understanding its potential for settlement and agriculture, reflecting God's promise of a "land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This exploration is not just a physical assessment but also a spiritual test of trust in God's provision.<p><b>and whether its people are strong or weak</b><br>The assessment of the inhabitants' strength is vital for strategic planning. The Canaanites were known for their fortified cities and military prowess, as seen in later biblical accounts (<a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6:1-5</a>). This evaluation would help the Israelites prepare for potential conflicts. The strength of the people can also be seen as a test of faith; despite the apparent might of the Canaanites, God had promised victory to Israel. This echoes the biblical theme that God's power is made perfect in human weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>few or many</b><br>The number of inhabitants would indicate the level of resistance the Israelites might face. A populous land could suggest a thriving economy and resources, but also a formidable opposition. This phrase highlights the tension between human assessment and divine promise. The Israelites' later fear of the numerous inhabitants (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>) contrasts with God's assurance of victory, illustrating the challenge of walking by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The census of the people is a practical concern but also a spiritual one, as it tests the Israelites' reliance on God's promise over their own understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who sent the twelve spies, including Joshua and Caleb, to explore the land of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_spies.htm">The Twelve Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each of the twelve tribes of Israel tasked with scouting the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites were to inherit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel, who were journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_paran.htm">The Wilderness of Paran</a></b><br>The location from which the spies were sent to explore Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The exploration of Canaan was an opportunity for the Israelites to trust in God's promise of the land.
