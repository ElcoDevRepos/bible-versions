Their story begins in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27</a>, where they courageously approach Moses to claim their inheritance rights, as their father died without male heirs. This act highlights the progressive nature of God's law, allowing for the protection and provision of women in a patriarchal society. Their names are mentioned multiple times, emphasizing their importance and the justice of their cause. The inclusion of their names in the biblical text underscores the value of each individual in God's eyes, regardless of gender.<p><b>were married to cousins on their father&#8217;s side</b><br>This marriage arrangement was in accordance with the command given by Moses in <a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6-9</a>, which was intended to keep the inheritance within the tribe of Manasseh. This reflects the cultural and legal practices of ancient Israel, where land inheritance was crucial for maintaining tribal identity and economic stability. By marrying within their father's clan, the daughters ensured that their father's name and property remained within the tribe, fulfilling the law and preserving the family lineage. This also prefigures the New Testament teaching of spiritual inheritance and the importance of maintaining faith within the community of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mahlah,_tirzah,_hoglah,_milcah,_and_noah.htm">Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah</a></b><br>These are the daughters of Zelophehad, who were granted the right to inherit their father's land in the absence of a male heir.

Back in <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-7</a> she stood beside her sisters to ask Moses for their father&#8217;s inheritance. Here, years later, she still walks in obedient faith, marrying within her own clan just as <a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6-8</a> prescribed so that her land would remain with the tribe of Manasseh. Compare the same pattern of obedience in <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3-4</a>, where the inheritance is confirmed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tirzah,</b><p>Tirzah&#8217;s name later becomes a royal city in Israel (<a href="/joshua/12-24.htm">Joshua 12:24</a>), a quiet testimony that faithfulness can grow into far-reaching influence. By accepting the boundaries God set for their marriages, she showed the wisdom praised in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>&#8212;trusting the Lord rather than leaning on personal preference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hoglah,</b><p>Hoglah&#8217;s inclusion underscores that no faithful believer is overlooked. Her choice to marry as directed parallels Mary&#8217;s humble &#8220;May it be to me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>), displaying the same spirit of submission to God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Milcah,</b><p>Milcah illustrates how obedience protects blessing. If she had married outside the tribe, her land would have shifted to another tribe at Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10-13</a>). Staying within Manasseh preserved the inheritance promised in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19-20</a>, reinforcing that God&#8217;s covenant purposes move forward through human cooperation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Noah,</b><p>Noah, the youngest, demonstrates that every generation has a role in safeguarding God&#8217;s promises. Her compliance anticipates Paul&#8217;s counsel in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> about wisely choosing a marriage partner who supports God&#8217;s calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughters of Zelophehad,</b><p>Their collective identity ties back to their father, whose name (<a href="/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>) means &#8220;shadow of fear,&#8221; yet his legacy is fearless faith. Together they echo <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>, where God &#8220;sets the lonely in families,&#8221; providing both inheritance and community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were married to cousins</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cousins&#8221; clarifies that they wed within their own clan, upholding Moses&#8217; directive (<a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This protected tribal boundaries established when the land was allotted (<a href="/bsb/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows later safeguards in <a href="/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2-3</a>, where right relationships are key to preserving covenant purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on their father&#8217;s side.</b><p>The phrase stresses patrilineal continuity. By aligning with their father&#8217;s side, they honored the fifth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) and kept Joseph&#8217;s tribal share intact, fulfilling Jacob&#8217;s prophetic blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/36-11.htm">Numbers 36:11</a> records the joyful obedience of Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters: each willingly married a paternal cousin so their newfound inheritance would stay inside Manasseh. Their actions validate God&#8217;s earlier ruling in <a href="/bsb/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27</a>, safeguard tribal boundaries, and model trustful submission. In them we see that honoring God&#8217;s Word in practical choices secures both present blessing and future legacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Were married unto their father's brothers' sons.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">unto the sons of their near kinsmen. </span>The word <span class= "ital">dod </span>generally denotes <span class= "ital">an uncle </span>on the father's side, and probably does so in the present case; but in <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm" title="And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.">Jeremiah 32:12</a> it seems to denote <span class= "ital">a cousin.</span><p>#define description=DESC<p>#define abbreviation=ABBR<p>#define comments=CMTS<p>#define version=3<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mahlah,</span> etc. It is a curious instance of the inartificial character of the sacred records that these five names, which have not the least interest in themselves, are repeated thrice in this Book, and once in Joshua (<a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>). It is evident that the case made a deep impression upon the mind of the nation at the time. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">father's brothers' sons.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> is always translated "father's brother," or "uncle;" and that seems to be its ordinary meaning, although in <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a> it stands for uncle's son. There is no reason to depart from the customary reading here. No doubt the daughters of Zelophehad acted according to the spirit as well as the letter of the law, and married the nearest male relatives who were open to their choice.
