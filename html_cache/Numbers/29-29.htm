This feast, also known as Sukkot, is a time of rejoicing and thanksgiving for the harvest. It is celebrated for seven days, and each day has specific sacrifices. The number of sacrifices decreases each day, symbolizing the completion and fulfillment of God's provision.<p><b>you are to present</b><br>The act of presenting offerings is a central aspect of worship in the Old Testament. It signifies obedience, reverence, and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The Israelites were commanded to bring these offerings to the tabernacle, and later the temple, as a way to maintain their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>eight bulls</b><br>Bulls were considered valuable and significant offerings due to their size and strength. The number eight in biblical numerology often symbolizes new beginnings or a new order. In the context of the Feast of Tabernacles, it may represent the renewal of the covenant and the hope for future blessings.<p><b>two rams</b><br>Rams were also important sacrificial animals, often associated with atonement and consecration. The number two can symbolize witness or testimony, possibly indicating the confirmation of God's promises to His people.<p><b>and fourteen male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs are frequently used in sacrificial contexts, symbolizing innocence and purity. The number fourteen, being a multiple of seven, often represents completeness or perfection. The specification of "a year old" indicates the prime age for sacrifice, ensuring the offering is at its best.<p><b>all unblemished</b><br>The requirement for offerings to be unblemished underscores the need for purity and perfection in sacrifices made to God. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God, without blemish or defect, offering Himself for the sins of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for worship and sacrifice as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where these sacrifices were to be offered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival during which these sacrifices were to be made, commemorating the Israelites' journey in the wilderness and God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_animals.htm">Sacrificial Animals</a></b><br>The bulls, rams, and lambs specified for the offerings, each representing different aspects of atonement and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's instructions precisely, highlighting the importance of obedience in our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>Each animal and its condition (unblemished) pointed to the need for purity and the foreshadowing of Christ's perfect sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Provision and Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles reminded the Israelites of God's provision during their wilderness journey, encouraging us to trust in God's faithfulness in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>The communal aspect of these sacrifices underscores the importance of gathering together in worship and supporting one another in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understanding these sacrifices helps us appreciate how Christ fulfills the law and offers a once-for-all atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 29:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_29_stress.htm">How does Numbers 29:29 emphasize the importance of specific offerings to God?

By the sixth day the count has moved from thirteen bulls on day one to eight. This steady &#8220;step-down&#8221; rhythm whispers that God&#8217;s provision is generous yet purposeful, pointing toward a climax on the seventh day and culminating in the sacred assembly on the eighth (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>).
