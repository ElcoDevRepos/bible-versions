The bull, being a valuable animal, signifies a significant offering, often associated with atonement and dedication. This practice is rooted in the Levitical laws, where bulls were used for burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-5, 4</a>:3-12). The bull as a sacrificial animal also points to the seriousness of the offering, symbolizing strength and submission to God.<p><b>a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah" in Hebrew, was a tribute to God, often accompanying animal sacrifices. It symbolized the dedication of the fruits of human labor to God, acknowledging His provision. Grain offerings were typically made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>). This offering represents the worshiper's gratitude and commitment to God, and it was a way to sanctify the daily sustenance provided by God.<p><b>of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. Three-tenths of an ephah would be a significant amount, indicating the importance of the offering. Fine flour was a luxury item, representing the best of what the worshiper could offer. This reflects the principle of giving God the first and best of one's resources, as seen in other offerings and tithes (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p><b>mixed with half a hin of olive oil</b><br>A hin is a unit of liquid measure, approximately 3.8 liters or about 1 gallon. Half a hin of olive oil would be about 1.9 liters. Olive oil was a valuable commodity in ancient Israel, used for cooking, lighting, and anointing. Mixing the fine flour with olive oil not only made the offering more valuable but also symbolized the Holy Spirit's presence and anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The use of oil in offerings is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with consecration and sanctification (<a href="/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and commandments from God, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, as they journeyed through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_bull.htm">Young Bull</a></b><br>An animal used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing strength and value.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice that was completely consumed by fire, representing total dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice made to express gratitude and fellowship with God, often shared in a communal meal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifice.htm">Understanding Sacrifice</a></b><br>The sacrificial system in the Old Testament was a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice.

<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By blending oil with flour, the text foreshadows the Spirit&#8217;s work in uniting believers to Christ, transforming routine gifts into fragrant worship (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9</a> prescribes a generous, carefully measured grain offering brought alongside a bull.
