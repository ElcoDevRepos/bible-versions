This divine guidance was crucial during their journey through the wilderness. The Tent refers to the Tabernacle, the dwelling place of God among His people. The lifting of the cloud signified that it was time for the Israelites to move. This movement was not random but directed by God, emphasizing His sovereignty and the importance of obedience to His commands. The cloud's presence is reminiscent of the pillar of cloud and fire that led the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), symbolizing God's continual presence and protection.<p><b>the Israelites would set out</b><br>The Israelites' journey was a physical manifestation of their spiritual journey and dependence on God. Their readiness to move at God's command reflects their trust and faith in His provision and timing. This obedience is a recurring theme in the wilderness narrative, highlighting the importance of following God's lead. The act of setting out also signifies a break from the past and a step towards the Promised Land, a journey of faith and transformation.<p><b>and wherever the cloud settled</b><br>The settling of the cloud indicated a place of rest and encampment for the Israelites. This divine signal provided assurance that they were exactly where God wanted them to be. The cloud's movement and settling were unpredictable, teaching the Israelites reliance on God's timing rather than their own understanding. This concept of divine rest is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to find rest in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>there the Israelites would camp</b><br>The Israelites' encampment was a time for rest, worship, and community building. It was during these times that they would receive further instructions from God, reinforcing their identity as His chosen people. The camp was organized around the Tabernacle, with the tribes arranged in a specific order, symbolizing order and unity under God's leadership. This structure foreshadows the New Testament church, where Christ is central, and believers are united in Him (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud.htm">The Cloud</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence and guidance, representing His divine direction and protection over the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting (Tabernacle)</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the cloud would settle, indicating God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years during which the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, learning to trust and obey God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were guided by the cloud, believers today are guided by the Holy Spirit.

It would appear from <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a> that there was nothing new in the fact of the cloudy fiery pillar directing the movements of the host, but only in the fact of its resting on the tabernacle when in repose. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the place where the cloud abode,</span> or "came down." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>. As the tabernacle was taken all to pieces, and its portions widely separated on the march, the cloud could not rest upon it as a signal for halting. We must probably picture to ourselves the cloud rising to some considerable height when it was "taken up," so as to be visible for a great distance, and as settling down again over the spot where the tabernacle was to be set up. In this way the signals given by the cloud would be immediately perceived by a vast multitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whenever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
