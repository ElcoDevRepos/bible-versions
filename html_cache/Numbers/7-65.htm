The use of oxen, significant for their strength and value, underscores the importance of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and the substantial amount of meat they provided, symbolizing abundance and God's provision. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where the offerer, priests, and sometimes the community shared in the meal.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing leadership and strength. The number five can signify grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>), indicating a connection to holiness and dedication to God. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and richness of the sacrifice.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>), representing atonement and purification. The presence of five male goats in this peace offering may symbolize the need for cleansing and reconciliation with God, even in times of thanksgiving and fellowship. Goats also remind us of the scapegoat ritual on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), pointing to the removal of sin.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. The lamb is a significant type of Christ, the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), who takes away the sin of the world. The number five again emphasizes grace, and the inclusion of lambs in the offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who brings peace between God and humanity.<p><b>This was the offering of Abidan son of Gideoni.</b><br>Abidan, the leader of the tribe of Benjamin, presents this offering on behalf of his tribe. His name means "my father is judge," which may reflect the role of God as the ultimate judge and provider. The tribe of Benjamin, though small, played a significant role in Israel's history, producing leaders like King Saul and the Apostle Paul. This offering signifies the tribe's participation in the communal worship and dedication to God, highlighting the unity and diversity within the twelve tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abidan.htm">Abidan</a></b><br>He is the son of Gideoni and the leader of the tribe of Benjamin.
