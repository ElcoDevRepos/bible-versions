The regular burnt offering, known as the "tamid," was a continual sacrifice made every morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). The drink offering, often wine, accompanied these sacrifices, symbolizing the pouring out of one's life in devotion to God (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). This addition underscores the importance of continual atonement and dedication to God, reflecting the need for constant communion with Him.<p><b>one male goat is to be presented to the LORD</b><br>The male goat, or "sa'ir," was commonly used as a sin offering, particularly on occasions requiring atonement for the community (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-24</a>). The choice of a goat highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for a substitute to bear the iniquity of the people. This act of presentation to the LORD signifies the transfer of sin from the people to the animal, a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering, or "chatat," was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and cleanse the sanctuary from impurity (<a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4:1-35</a>). This offering emphasizes the holiness of God and the need for purification from sin to maintain fellowship with Him. It points forward to Jesus Christ, who became the perfect sin offering, taking upon Himself the sins of humanity (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The repeated need for sin offerings in the Old Testament highlights the insufficiency of animal sacrifices and the necessity of Christ's once-for-all atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God to whom the laws and offerings were given.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites performed their sacrifices and offerings to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_offering.htm">The Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering made to atone for sin, symbolizing repentance and seeking forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who established the covenant and the sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The sin offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.
