Eleazar, son of Aaron, represents the priestly authority and spiritual guidance necessary for the Israelites. The standing before the priest signifies respect and acknowledgment of the priestly office, which serves as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>who will seek counsel for him before the LORD</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of divine guidance in leadership decisions. Seeking counsel before the LORD underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where decisions are made not solely based on human wisdom but through divine revelation. This practice reflects the dependence on God for direction, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>by the judgment of the Urim</b><br>The Urim, along with the Thummim, were sacred lots used by the high priest to discern God's will. Their exact nature is unknown, but they were likely stones or objects kept in the breastplate of the high priest. The use of the Urim signifies a direct and tangible method of receiving God's guidance, highlighting the seriousness and sacredness of the decision-making process.<p><b>At his command, he and all the Israelites with him</b><br>This phrase indicates the authority given to Joshua as the leader of Israel. His command is not just personal but extends to the entire nation, showing the unity and collective movement of the people under God's appointed leader. It reflects the hierarchical structure of leadership, with Joshua as the military and administrative head.<p><b>the entire congregation</b><br>The term "congregation" refers to the whole assembly of Israel, emphasizing the communal aspect of their journey and mission. It highlights the unity and collective identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people, bound together by covenant and purpose.<p><b>will go out and come in</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom for conducting daily affairs, including military campaigns and community activities. It signifies the comprehensive scope of Joshua's leadership, covering all aspects of life. This phrase also implies protection and provision, as going out and coming in safely is a sign of God's blessing and presence with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar served as the high priest after Aaron's death.

Moses was as much above the priests as he was above the tribe princes; but Joshua was only the civil and military head of the nation, and was as much subordinate to the high priest in one way as the high priest was subordinate to him in another. In after times no doubt the political headship quite overpowered and overshadowed the ecclesiastical, but this does not seem to have been so intended, or to have been the case in Eleazar's lifetime.

What it actually was, and how it was used in con-suiting God, is not told us in Scripture, and has left no reliable trace in the tradition of the Jews; it must, therefore, remain for ever an insoluble mystery. It does not appear that Moses ever sought the judgment of Urim, for he possessed more direct means of ascertaining the will of God; nor does it seem ever to have been resorted to after the time of David, for the "more sure word of prophecy" superseded it.
