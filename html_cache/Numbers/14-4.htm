It reflects a moment of communal despair and rebellion against God's plan. The Israelites had just received the report from the spies about the Promised Land, and their fear led them to consider drastic measures. This moment is a turning point, showing a lack of faith in God's promises and leadership through Moses.<p><b>Let us appoint a leader</b><br>The desire to appoint a new leader signifies a rejection of Moses, who was chosen by God to lead them out of Egypt. This reflects a deeper spiritual rebellion, as Moses was not just a political leader but a mediator between God and the people. The Israelites' call for a new leader can be seen as a rejection of divine authority, paralleling other biblical instances where God's chosen leaders were challenged, such as the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16).<p><b>and return to Egypt</b><br>Returning to Egypt symbolizes a desire to go back to a place of bondage and slavery, both physically and spiritually. Egypt, in biblical typology, often represents sin and the world from which God delivers His people. This longing to return highlights the Israelites' lack of trust in God's provision and plan for their future. It also foreshadows the human tendency to revert to old ways when faced with challenges, rather than moving forward in faith. This moment contrasts with the New Testament call to leave behind the old life and press on toward the new life in Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, who assists Moses in leading the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants as their inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rebellion.htm">The Danger of Rebellion</a></b><br><a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> highlights the Israelites' desire to appoint a leader to return to Egypt, demonstrating a rebellious spirit against God's plan.

Choosing another leader is therefore rebellion against God, not merely against Moses.<p>&#8226; This mirrors later uprisings like Korah&#8217;s challenge (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a>) and Stephen&#8217;s summary of Israel&#8217;s history: &#8220;Our fathers were unwilling to obey Moses.

The verse warns that grumbling can grow into organized rebellion, that rejecting divine authority leads to futile alternatives, and that longing for past slavery blinds us to present grace. Faith calls us to heed God&#8217;s Word, honor His appointed guidance, and press forward into the freedom He has secured.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</span> Although this was only proposed in the wildness of their distress, yet it was a height of rebellion to which they had never risen before. They had lamented that they had not died in Egypt, and they had wished themselves back in Egypt, but they had never proposed to take any overt steps towards returning thither. Nothing less than an entire and deliberate revolt was involved in the wish to elect a captain for themselves, for the angel of the covenant was the Captain of the Lord's host (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>). The proposal to depose him, and to choose another in his place, marked the extremity of the despair, the unbelief, and the ingratitude of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/14-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
