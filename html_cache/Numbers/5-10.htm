In the context of ancient Israel, sacred gifts could include tithes, offerings, and sacrifices. These were acts of worship and devotion, reflecting the individual's relationship with God. The concept of sacred gifts being personal is rooted in the idea that worship is a personal act of faith and commitment. This aligns with the broader biblical principle that each person is accountable to God for their own actions (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><b>but whatever he gives to the priest</b><br>The role of the priest in ancient Israel was to act as a mediator between the people and God. Priests were from the tribe of Levi, specifically the descendants of Aaron, and were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the tabernacle or temple. The gifts given to the priest were part of the support system for the Levitical priesthood, as they did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-21</a>). This system ensured that the priests could focus on their spiritual duties without the burden of providing for themselves through agriculture or other means.<p><b>will belong to the priest.</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle that once a gift is given to the priest, it becomes his property. This reflects the broader biblical theme of provision for those who serve in ministry. In the New Testament, this principle is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul discusses the right of those who preach the gospel to receive their living from the gospel. The idea is that those who dedicate their lives to spiritual service should be supported by the community they serve. This also prefigures the ultimate priesthood of Jesus Christ, who, as our High Priest, receives the offerings of our lives and devotion (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws and instructions in the Book of Numbers were given.

Each Israelite decided what portion of crops, animals, or valuables he would dedicate to the LORD (cf. <a href="/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sacred&#8221; identifies these gifts as set apart&#8212;no longer common property but devoted to God&#8217;s purposes, echoing <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>, &#8220;Every tenth of the land&#8230; is holy to the LORD&#8221;.<p>&#8226; God dignifies individual devotion; He receives each person&#8217;s offering as meaningful, whether large or small (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are his own</b><p>&#8226; Before being presented, the offering remains under the giver&#8217;s stewardship. The law does not coerce; rather, it protects voluntary generosity (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, &#8220;Each one should give what he has decided in his heart to give&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This ownership principle also guards against misappropriation by others. No neighbor or tribal leader can divert what belongs to the giver and God (see <a href="/acts/5-4.htm">Acts 5:4</a> for the same concept in the early church).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But whatever he gives</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Whatever&#8221; broadens the horizon from tithes to any freewill contribution&#8212;grain, oil, firstborn animals, or vowed items (<a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse stresses personal choice: once the giver places the sacred portion into priestly hands, a transfer occurs.<p>&#8226; Giving becomes a concrete act of faith, mirroring <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, &#8220;Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the priest</b><p>&#8226; Priests served as mediators, receiving tangible symbols of worship on God&#8217;s behalf (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their livelihood depended on this system, since they owned no land inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By channeling gifts &#8220;to the priest,&#8221; the Lord ensured continual ministry at the tabernacle, paralleling the New Testament principle that &#8220;those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will belong to the priest</b><p>&#8226; Once transferred, ownership changes permanently. The priest may use or consume the gift as provided in laws like <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a> (the breast and right thigh of peace offerings).<p>&#8226; This affirms God&#8217;s provision for His servants while preventing strings-attached giving. The donor relinquishes control, trusting both priestly integrity and divine oversight (<a href="/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10-13</a> shows reforms when this provision was neglected).<p>&#8226; The principle anticipates Christ-centered stewardship today: believers support those who minister the Word (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/5-10.htm">Numbers 5:10</a> teaches that offerings begin as the worshiper&#8217;s personal, voluntary possessions, yet once given, they become the priest&#8217;s rightful provision. God safeguards both the giver&#8217;s freedom and the minister&#8217;s livelihood, illustrating responsible stewardship, wholehearted devotion, and faithful support for those called to serve Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man's hallowed things.</span> Dedicatory offerings, such as first-fruits, not exactly of the nature of sacrifices.
