The mention of his lack of sons is significant in the context of ancient Israelite society, where inheritance and family lineage were typically passed through male descendants. This situation sets the stage for a pivotal legal case regarding inheritance rights for daughters, which is later addressed in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27</a>. The absence of sons in Zelophehad's family highlights the importance of preserving family names and property within the tribes of Israel, a concern that is addressed by God through Moses.<p><b>The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</b><br>The listing of Zelophehad's daughters by name is notable, as it underscores their importance in the biblical narrative. Each name carries its own meaning and significance. Mahlah means "sickness" or "disease," Noah means "motion" or "rest," Hoglah means "partridge," Milcah means "queen" or "counsel," and Tirzah means "delight" or "pleasure." These names reflect the cultural practice of naming children with meanings that may reflect circumstances of birth or parental hopes. The daughters of Zelophehad are later recognized for their faith and boldness in approaching Moses to claim their inheritance rights, which leads to a change in the law that allows daughters to inherit if there are no sons. This legal precedent is a significant moment in biblical history, demonstrating God's justice and care for all members of His people, regardless of gender.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Manasseh, son of Hepher.

This detail anchors the upcoming inheritance discussion squarely in real history&#8212;Zelophehad was an actual man in a particular tribe, not a fictional illustration.

The census identifies every household circumstance, showing that God does not overlook anyone, even a seemingly vulnerable family line (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But only daughters</b><p>Rather than viewing the phrase as a deficiency, the text highlights five young women whom God Himself will soon commend (<a href="/numbers/27-6.htm">Numbers 27:6&#8211;7</a>).
