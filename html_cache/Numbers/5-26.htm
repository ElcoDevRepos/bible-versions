The grain offering, typically made of barley, is significant as it represents the fruits of the earth and the labor of the people. The priest taking a handful as a memorial portion signifies a reminder before God, invoking His attention and judgment. This act of remembrance is a common theme in offerings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>, where the memorial portion is burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. The use of barley, a less expensive grain, may symbolize humility and the seriousness of the situation.<p><b>and burn it on the altar;</b><br>Burning the offering on the altar is a symbolic act of presenting it to God, seeking His divine judgment and intervention. The altar, central to Israelite worship, represents a place of sacrifice and communication with God. This act of burning signifies purification and the seeking of divine truth. The altar's role in sacrifices is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>, where offerings are burned as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. The burning of the grain offering in this context underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for divine insight.<p><b>after that he is to have the woman drink the water.</b><br>The water, mixed with dust from the tabernacle floor and ink from the written curses, is a crucial part of the ritual. This act is unique to the trial of jealousy described in <a href="/numbers/5.htm">Numbers 5</a>. The drinking of the water serves as a test of innocence or guilt, with the belief that God will reveal the truth through physical manifestations. This reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where divine intervention was sought in legal matters. The ritual underscores the seriousness of marital fidelity and the community's reliance on God's justice. The concept of water as a means of revealing truth can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as the bitter waters of Marah in <a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23-25</a>, where God transforms the water to reveal His provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A religious leader responsible for performing the ritual described in this passage.
