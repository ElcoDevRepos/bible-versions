This phrase highlights Moses' role as a faithful servant and leader who acts according to divine instruction. His obedience sets a precedent for Israel's leaders and reflects the importance of following God's will. This act of obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who followed God's commands, such as Noah building the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2-3</a>).<p><b>He took Joshua,</b><br>Joshua, the son of Nun, is introduced as Moses' successor. His selection is significant as he represents a new generation of leadership for Israel. Joshua had already proven his faithfulness and capability, notably as one of the two spies who trusted in God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>). His name, meaning "The LORD is salvation," is a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus, whose name in Hebrew is Yeshua, the same as Joshua.<p><b>had him stand before Eleazar the priest</b><br>Eleazar, the son of Aaron, serves as the high priest, a role of spiritual leadership and mediation between God and the people. By having Joshua stand before Eleazar, the text emphasizes the importance of spiritual authority and the priestly blessing in the commissioning of leaders. This act signifies the divine approval and religious legitimacy of Joshua's leadership. The priestly role is a type of Christ, who is our high priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>).<p><b>and the whole congregation,</b><br>The presence of the whole congregation underscores the communal aspect of leadership transition. It ensures transparency and public acknowledgment of Joshua's new role. This public commissioning is crucial for maintaining unity and continuity within the Israelite community. It reflects the biblical principle of communal witness and accountability, as seen in other instances of public declarations, such as the covenant renewal at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Again and again Scripture says, &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-27.htm">Numbers 20:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>). That pattern reaches all the way back to the building of the tabernacle and forward to his final acts before death. God speaks, Moses acts.<p>- This obedience is immediate and complete. Partial compliance or creative editing of God&#8217;s instructions has wrecked other leaders (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-10</a>). Moses models the healthy fear of the LORD praised in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> and demonstrated by Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>).<p>- For us, the verse underscores Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The passage invites every believer to mirror Moses&#8217; quick-to-obey heart, trusting that God&#8217;s way is best even when it reshapes personal plans.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He took Joshua</b><p>- Joshua is God&#8217;s clear choice, named in <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18</a> and confirmed in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>&#8208;8. Moses does not debate or delay; he simply &#8220;took Joshua.&#8221;<p>- Notice the mentor&#8217;s humility. After leading Israel for forty years, Moses gladly moves aside so another man can shepherd the flock (compare <a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>). His life displays <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a> centuries before Paul writes it.<p>- Joshua, in turn, accepts the charge without fanfare. The torch is passed in a public act of faith, mirroring Elijah&#8217;s later handoff to Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9-15</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s people still need fresh leaders raised up &#8220;in season&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). Mature believers, like Moses, take initiative to affirm and equip them (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation</b><p>- Public commissioning matters. By bringing Joshua &#8220;before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,&#8221; Moses ensures transparent transfer of authority (<a href="/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19-21</a>). No back-room deal, no private ceremony.<p>- Eleazar&#8217;s presence highlights the priestly role of intercession and guidance through the Urim (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>). The leader will lean on God&#8217;s revealed will, not mere military strategy&#8212;an early reminder of <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, &#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit.&#8221;<p>- The entire assembly witnesses, echoing <a href="/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7-8</a> when Israel first said, &#8220;We will do everything the LORD has spoken.&#8221; Corporate accountability balances leadership authority (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5-6</a>; 14:23).<p>- Today, ordination services and church-wide recognitions carry forward this biblical pattern. They reinforce <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>&#8212;that leaders watch over souls and will give an account&#8212;while also encouraging the body to pray and follow with joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-22.htm">Numbers 27:22</a> captures a seamless chain of obedience: God commands, Moses complies, Joshua steps forward, the priest and people affirm. The verse celebrates faith expressed in action, leadership grounded in humility, and community built on transparency. For every generation, the call is the same&#8212;hear the Lord, obey promptly, pass the faith on publicly, and trust God to guide the journey ahead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/27-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
