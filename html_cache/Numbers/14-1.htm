The context is the aftermath of the report from the spies sent to Canaan, which caused fear and despair among the Israelites. This collective outcry reflects a lack of faith and trust in God's promises, as they were overwhelmed by the negative report. The term "congregation" suggests the entire assembly of Israel, emphasizing the widespread nature of their fear. This moment is pivotal as it demonstrates the people's tendency to doubt and rebel against God's plan, a recurring theme throughout their wilderness journey. The act of lifting up their voices is a sign of deep distress and lamentation, often seen in biblical narratives when people face dire circumstances (e.g., <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, when the Israelites cried out under Egyptian bondage).<p><b>and that night the people wept</b><br>The phrase "that night" underscores the immediacy and intensity of the emotional response. The night can symbolize a period of darkness and uncertainty, both literally and metaphorically, as the Israelites grapple with their perceived hopelessness. The act of weeping signifies profound sorrow and regret, a common human response to fear and disappointment. This weeping can be seen as a lack of faith in God's ability to deliver them, despite the miracles they had witnessed, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna. The people's reaction contrasts with the faith of Caleb and Joshua, who trusted in God's promise to give them the land (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>). This moment foreshadows the consequences of their unbelief, as God later decrees that this generation will not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>). The weeping also serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and obedience in the face of challenges, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_congregation.htm">The Whole Congregation</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land.
