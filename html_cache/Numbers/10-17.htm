The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was central to Israelite worship and symbolized God's presence among His people. The process of taking it down was a carefully orchestrated task, reflecting the order and reverence required in handling sacred objects. This act also signifies a transition, as the Israelites moved according to God's guidance, represented by the cloud over the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>).<p><b>and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out</b><br>The Gershonites and Merarites were two of the three Levitical clans responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle. The Gershonites were tasked with carrying the curtains, coverings, and hangings (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-26</a>), while the Merarites handled the frames, bars, pillars, and bases (<a href="/numbers/4-31.htm">Numbers 4:31-32</a>). This division of labor highlights the importance of community and cooperation in fulfilling God's commands. It also underscores the specialized roles within the body of believers, as seen in the New Testament's depiction of spiritual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-31</a>).<p><b>transporting it</b><br>The transportation of the tabernacle was a significant logistical undertaking, requiring precision and care. This movement was not merely a physical task but a spiritual one, as it involved the relocation of the place where God met with His people. The careful handling of the tabernacle's components reflects the holiness of God and the need for purity and reverence in worship. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and whose body was "taken down" and "transported" in His death and resurrection, fulfilling the ultimate purpose of God's presence with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.

The precise position which the three bodies of Levites were to occupy in the marches is defined in this chapter. The Gershonites, who had the charge of the curtains and hangings of the Tabernacle and the court (<a href="/context/numbers/4-25.htm" title="And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above on it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:25-26</a>), with their two wagons, and the Merarites, who had the charge of the heavier and more bulky materials (<a href="/context/numbers/4-31.htm" title="And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof,">Numbers 4:31-32</a>), with their four wagons, were to set forward after the first or eastern camp, which was composed of the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon, in order that they might have time to erect the Tabernacle before the arrival of the Kohathites, "bearing the sanctuary" (or sacred things). Next in order after the Gershonites and Merarites followed the southern camp, consisting of the three tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. Then followed the Kohathites in the centre of the procession, "bearing the sanctuary." After them marched the three tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, who formed the western camp, and as the rereward, the three tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, which formed the northern camp. This arrangement serves to throw light upon <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm" title="Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up your strength, and come and save us.">Psalm 80:2</a> : "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the tabernacle was taken down.</span> That is, the fabric of it; the boards, curtains, and other heavy portions which were packed upon the six wagons provided for the purpose (<a href="/numbers/7-5.htm">Numbers 7:5-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward.</span> Between the first and second divisions of the host. In chapter 2 it had been directed in general terms that "the tabernacle" should set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the host, between the second and third divisions. At that time the duties of the several Levitical families had not been specified, and the orders for the taking down and transport of the tabernacle and its furniture had not been given in detail. It would be historically an error, and theologically a superstition, to imagine that Divine commands such as these had no elasticity, and left no room for adaptation, under the teaching of experience, or for the sake of obvious convenience. Whether the present modification was directly commanded by God himself, or whether it was made on the authority of Moses, does not here appear. There can be no question that subsequent theocratic rulers of Israel claimed and used a large liberty in modifying the Divinely-originated ritual and order. Compare the case of the passover, the arrangements of Solomon's temple as corresponding with those of the tabernacle, and even the use of the silver trumpets.
