It signifies God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Exodus is a central theme throughout the Old Testament, symbolizing salvation and redemption. It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who leads believers out of the bondage of sin.<p><b>with strength like a wild ox</b><br>The wild ox, or "reem" in Hebrew, is often associated with great strength and power. This imagery emphasizes the might and vigor with which God empowers Israel. The wild ox is a symbol of untamed strength, suggesting that Israel, under God's guidance, possesses formidable power against its enemies. This strength is not inherent but is a divine gift, reflecting God's sovereignty and provision.<p><b>to devour hostile nations</b><br>This phrase indicates the divine mandate given to Israel to conquer the nations in the Promised Land. It reflects the historical context of the Israelites' journey to Canaan, where they were to establish a nation dedicated to God. The conquest is seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land. It also serves as a type of the spiritual warfare Christians engage in, overcoming spiritual adversaries through God's power.<p><b>and crush their bones</b><br>Crushing bones is a metaphor for complete and utter defeat. It signifies the totality of the victory God grants to Israel over its enemies. This imagery is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern context, where military victories were often described in graphic terms. It underscores the idea that those who oppose God's people will face decisive judgment.<p><b>to pierce them with arrows</b><br>Arrows symbolize precision and effectiveness in battle. This phrase suggests that Israel's victories are not only powerful but also strategically executed. It highlights God's role as a divine warrior who fights on behalf of His people. The use of arrows can also be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment, which is both accurate and unavoidable. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a righteous judge who defends His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who delivers and empowers His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation brought out of Egypt, symbolizing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which God delivered Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>The prophet who speaks this oracle under God's influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region where Balaam delivers his prophecy, representing opposition to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as God brought Israel out of Egypt, He delivers us from sin and bondage.
