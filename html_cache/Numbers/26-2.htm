It reflects the importance of order and organization within the Israelite community. The census serves both practical and spiritual purposes, ensuring that the people are prepared for future challenges. Historically, censuses were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures for administrative and military purposes. This census marks a new generation after the previous one had perished in the wilderness due to disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>).<p><b>by the houses of their fathers</b><br>The reference to "houses of their fathers" emphasizes the patriarchal structure of Israelite society, where lineage and tribal affiliation were crucial for identity and inheritance. This structure is rooted in the promises made to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it underscores the continuity of God's covenant with their descendants. The tribal divisions also play a significant role in the allocation of land in the Promised Land (Joshua 13-21).<p><b>all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty is significant as it marks the age of military service and responsibility within the community. This age requirement reflects the maturity and strength needed for warfare, as well as the ability to contribute to the community's defense and survival. The age of twenty is consistently used in other biblical contexts for similar purposes (<a href="/exodus/30-14.htm">Exodus 30:14</a>).<p><b>who can serve in the army of Israel</b><br>The census is specifically for those eligible for military service, highlighting the immediate need for a prepared and organized fighting force as Israel approaches the conquest of Canaan. This military readiness is not only a practical necessity but also a fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham. The concept of Israel as God's army is further developed in passages like <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>, where the commander of the Lord's army appears to Joshua, symbolizing divine support in their military endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, tasked with taking the census as commanded by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, who assists Moses in conducting the census.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, specifically the men aged twenty and older, who are counted in the census.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are encamped and where the census is conducted.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The event of counting the Israelite men eligible for military service, marking a new generation after the previous one perished in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The census was a direct command from God, illustrating the importance of obedience in the life of believers.

Earlier, He had already told Moses, &#8220;Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by their clans and families&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>), establishing a pattern of orderly record-keeping.<p>&#8226; This counting is not curiosity&#8212;it is obedience. <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a> shows that a census belongs to the LORD, and ignoring His instructions once brought a plague (<a href="/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The detailed rolls underscore that &#8220;even the very hairs of your head are all numbered&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>). The God who numbers the stars (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>) also numbers His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the whole congregation of Israel</b><p>The phrase stresses inclusiveness: everyone who belongs to God&#8217;s covenant nation is involved. Earlier, at Passover, &#8220;The whole congregation of Israel must celebrate it&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-47.htm">Exodus 12:47</a>), and later, Ezra gathered &#8220;the whole assembly&#8221; to hear the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; No tribe, clan, or household stands outside God&#8217;s concern. <a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a> tells us there is &#8220;no difference between Jew and Greek,&#8221; foreshadowing the wideness of grace that began with national Israel but extends to all who believe.<p>&#8226; Practical unity flows from recognized identity; <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a> notes, &#8220;All the believers were together,&#8221; echoing this same covenant solidarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the houses of their fathers</b><p>Counting by paternal households safeguarded inheritance, leadership, and land allotment. <a href="/numbers/1-18.htm">Numbers 1:18</a> shows the tribes &#8220;declared their ancestry by their clans and families.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Genealogical order mattered because the land would soon be parceled &#8220;to each family by lot&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>).<p>&#8226; Family lines preserve covenant promises: through Judah&#8217;s records came David (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>) and ultimately Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even today, spiritual family identity matters: &#8220;I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all those twenty years of age or older</b><p>Age twenty marked adult responsibility in Israel.

A general command to "vex the Midianites" had indeed been given (<a href="/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17</a>) on the principle of just retribution (cf. <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>), but no attempt seems to have been made to act upon it until a more specific order was issued (<a href="/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>). In any case the present mustering has to do with something far more important, viz., with the approaching settlement of the people in its own territory. This is clear from the instructions given in verses 52-56, and from the distribution of the tribes into families. <span class="cmt_word">From twenty years.</span> See on chapter Numbers 1:3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/26-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Take a census</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">congregation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5712.htm">Strong's 5712: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stated assemblage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those twenty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years of age</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;ben)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
