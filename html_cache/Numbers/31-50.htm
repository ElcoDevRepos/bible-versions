The spoils of war included various gold articles. Offering these to the LORD signifies gratitude and recognition of God's role in their victory. This act of giving back to God from what they acquired is reminiscent of the principle of firstfruits, where the first and best of what one receives is dedicated to God (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>). It also reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, acknowledging that all possessions ultimately belong to God (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><b>armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces&#8212;</b><br>These items were common forms of personal adornment in the ancient Near East, often signifying wealth and status. Archaeological findings have uncovered similar items in ancient burial sites, indicating their value and cultural significance. In the biblical narrative, such items are frequently mentioned as part of the spoils of war (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>, <a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-3</a>). The specific mention of these items highlights the tangible nature of the offering and the personal sacrifice involved, as these were likely cherished possessions.<p><b>to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Atonement in the Old Testament involves reconciliation with God, often through a sacrificial offering. The need for atonement here suggests a recognition of sin or impurity associated with the battle, possibly due to contact with death or the taking of life (<a href="/numbers/31-19.htm">Numbers 31:19-24</a>). This act of atonement underscores the holiness of God and the need for purification before Him. It foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The Israelites' offering serves as a type, pointing to the greater atonement that would be accomplished through Christ's death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is overseeing the events and receiving the offerings from the soldiers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_soldiers.htm">Israelite Soldiers</a></b><br>The men who went to battle against the Midianites and are now bringing offerings to the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites in battle, whose possessions are now being offered to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom the offerings are being made as an act of atonement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement_offering.htm">Atonement Offering</a></b><br>The act of bringing gifts to God to make amends for sin or impurity, acknowledging His holiness and their need for reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_atonement.htm">The Importance of Atonement</a></b><br>Atonement is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing the need for reconciliation with God.
