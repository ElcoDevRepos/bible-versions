This act of numbering, or taking a census, was a practical measure for managing the community, especially in preparation for their roles in the service of the Tabernacle. The Levites were set apart for specific duties, and this census ensured that each family and individual was accounted for. This reflects the order and structure that God desired for His people, emphasizing the importance of each person's role in the community.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD</b><br>The phrase underscores the divine authority behind Moses' actions. It was not merely a human decision but a directive from God Himself. This highlights the theme of obedience to God's commands, which is a recurring motif throughout the Pentateuch. The "word of the LORD" signifies the communication of God's will, often delivered through prophets or directly to leaders like Moses. This obedience is crucial for maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>as he had been commanded</b><br>This emphasizes Moses' faithfulness and submission to God's instructions. It reflects the biblical principle that leaders are to act in accordance with God's commands, serving as examples to the people. Moses' obedience is a model for leadership, showing that true leadership involves following God's guidance rather than personal ambition. This phrase also connects to the broader narrative of Israel's journey, where obedience to God's commands is linked to blessings and success, while disobedience leads to consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
