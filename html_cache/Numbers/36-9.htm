The context is the resolution of the issue raised by the daughters of Zelophehad, who were concerned about losing their father's inheritance if they married outside their tribe. This law ensured that land, a critical resource in ancient Israel, remained within the original tribal allocations as established by God through Moses (<a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). The land was not just a physical asset but a divine gift and a symbol of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This regulation prevented the dilution of tribal identity and maintained the socio-political structure ordained by God.<p><b>for each tribe of Israel must retain its inheritance</b><br>The emphasis on each tribe retaining its inheritance underscores the importance of the land as a perpetual possession. This was not merely a legal matter but a theological one, as the land was seen as a covenantal gift from God. The tribes of Israel were to steward their allotted portions as a testament to God's faithfulness and provision. This principle is echoed in the Jubilee laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-34</a>), where land was to revert to the original family owners every fifty years, further ensuring that the inheritance remained within the tribe. Theologically, this points to the idea of God's people being set apart and having a distinct identity, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through the spiritual inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">The Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These women were instrumental in bringing about a change in inheritance laws for daughters in Israel.
