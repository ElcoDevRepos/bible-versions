The mention of "clans" indicates the subdivisions within the tribe, which were often based on family lines. In the context of <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, this census was taken as the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land, and it was important for organizing the distribution of land and military responsibilities. Zebulun's territory would later be located in the northern part of Israel, near the Sea of Galilee, which was significant for trade and commerce.<p><b>and their registration numbered 60,500</b><br>The census number of 60,500 reflects the military strength of the tribe of Zebulun at that time. This was an increase from the previous census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, where Zebulun had 57,400 men. The increase in numbers could be seen as a sign of God's blessing and faithfulness to His promise to multiply the descendants of Abraham. The tribe's growth also underscores the importance of Zebulun in the collective strength of Israel as they prepared to conquer Canaan. In a broader biblical context, the tribe of Zebulun is mentioned in the blessings of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18-19</a>), where their future prosperity and role in trade and maritime activities are highlighted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, whose descendants formed one of the tribes of Israel.
