The context is the aftermath of the spies' return from Canaan, where they reported on the land. The congregation refers to the entire community of Israel, which was organized into tribes and camped around the Tabernacle. This setting underscores the communal nature of Israel's journey and decision-making process. Historically, this reflects the theocratic leadership structure where God communicated His will through appointed leaders like Moses, Aaron, and in this case, Joshua and Caleb.<p><b>&#8220;The land we passed through and explored</b><br>This refers to the reconnaissance mission undertaken by the twelve spies, as detailed earlier in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>. The land in question is Canaan, the Promised Land, which God had pledged to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The exploration was a strategic move to assess the land's resources and the strength of its inhabitants. Geographically, Canaan was a fertile region, known for its agricultural potential, which is why it was often described as a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>is an exceedingly good land.</b><br>This statement is a direct affirmation of the land's quality and potential, contrasting with the negative report given by the other ten spies. The phrase "exceedingly good" emphasizes the abundance and fertility of Canaan, aligning with God's promises of a prosperous land for His people. This echoes the biblical theme of God's provision and faithfulness. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, with Canaan symbolizing the blessings and rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>). The positive report by Joshua and Caleb highlights their faith and trust in God's promises, setting a precedent for reliance on divine assurance over human fear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_and_caleb.htm">Joshua and Caleb</a></b><br>These two men were among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan.

Their &#8220;said&#8221; is not a whisper; it is a public, courageous declaration that lines up with earlier faith statements (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-29.htm">Deuteronomy 1:29-33</a>).
