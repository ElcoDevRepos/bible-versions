This event occurs during a period of significant unrest among the Israelites in the wilderness, as recorded in the Book of Numbers. The rebellion is a direct challenge to the authority God has given Moses, and Moses' response is one of obedience to God's direction. This phrase highlights Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity. The act of going to Dathan and Abiram also demonstrates Moses' willingness to address conflict directly, a leadership quality that is emphasized throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>and the elders of Israel followed him</b><br>The elders of Israel represent the leadership structure established by Moses under God's guidance, as seen in <a href="/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a> when Jethro advises Moses to appoint leaders to help govern the people. Their following Moses indicates their support and recognition of his God-given authority. This unity among the leaders contrasts with the rebellion of Dathan and Abiram, underscoring the importance of following divinely appointed leadership. The elders' presence also serves as witnesses to the events that unfold, ensuring that the account of God's judgment and Moses' leadership is accurately recorded and remembered. This moment foreshadows the New Testament concept of church leadership and the importance of unity within the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
