This method is seen in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>, where Joshua casts lots for the tribes in Shiloh. The casting of lots is a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures for decision-making, reflecting a reliance on divine will rather than human judgment. It underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and providence in the allocation of the Promised Land.<p><b>among the larger and smaller tribes.</b><br>The division of land among both larger and smaller tribes highlights the principle of equity and justice in God's law. Larger tribes, such as Judah and Joseph, received more land due to their size, while smaller tribes, like Benjamin and Simeon, received less. This allocation reflects the census taken earlier in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, where the population of each tribe was recorded. The principle of proportional inheritance is consistent with the biblical theme of fairness and the importance of community, ensuring that each tribe, regardless of size, has a place in the Promised Land. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the body of Christ, where each member, regardless of size or strength, has a unique and valued role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is overseeing the census and the division of the land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>Assists Moses in the census and the allocation of the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are being prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>A counting of the Israelite men, which serves as a basis for dividing the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_in_allocation.htm">Divine Sovereignty in Allocation</a></b><br>The division of the land by lot underscores God's control and fairness in distributing resources among His people.
