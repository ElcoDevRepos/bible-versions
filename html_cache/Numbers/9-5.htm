It is here that they received the Law, including the Ten Commandments, and where they constructed the Tabernacle. This wilderness period is a time of testing and preparation for the Israelites as they transition from slavery to becoming a covenant people. The obedience of the Israelites in this setting underscores their commitment to follow God's commands despite the harsh and challenging environment.<p><b>at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month</b><br>The timing of this event is crucial as it aligns with the Passover, which is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the first month, Nisan, in the Hebrew calendar. Twilight marks the beginning of the new day in Jewish tradition, and this specific timing is a direct command from God as seen in <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>. The Passover commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing God's salvation and protection. This observance in the wilderness highlights the continuity of God's covenant and the importance of remembering His past acts of deliverance.<p><b>The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the obedience of the Israelites to God's instructions given through Moses. It reflects a pattern of faithfulness that is expected of God's people, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. Moses, as the mediator of God's covenant, is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfills and mediates the new covenant. The Israelites' adherence to God's commands here foreshadows the call for believers to live in obedience to Christ's teachings. This obedience is not merely ritualistic but is a demonstration of faith and trust in God's promises and His appointed leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness.

The first difficulty does not seem serious when we consider, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that kids were available as well as lambs (see on Exodus 12:3); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the desert tribes would have abundance of lambs and kids for sale at this season, and that the Israelites certainly had money; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that in view of their speedy departure they would be disposed to kill off the young of their own flocks. The second difficulty is more serious, and would be insurmountable if we had to believe that the ritual of this passover was the same which afterwards prevailed. Josephus tells us ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3) that in his day 256,000 lambs were slain and their blood sprinkled upon the altar within the three hours "between the evenings." At that time, according to the same authority, a lamb was shared by ten, and often by as many as twenty people. The number of males who would partake of the paschal meal in the wilderness may be set down as not more than 800,000. If the women partook of it at all (which is very doubtful; cf. <a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44, 48</a>), they would doubtless content themselves with the scraps left by the men. Allowing twenty souls to each lamb, the number required would be not more than 40,000. It is obvious at once that the three priests could not possibly kill 40,000 lambs in three hours, much less sprinkle their blood upon the altar; indeed the same may be said for 10,000, or even 5000, especially as they could not have acquired the extreme dexterity and dispatch which long practice taught to the later priests. Nor is it satisfactory to reply that the priests did the work "out of the hand of the Levites ' (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>),  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and they [did so]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
