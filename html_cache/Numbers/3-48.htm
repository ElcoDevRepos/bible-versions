The money mentioned here is a redemption price for the excess number of firstborn Israelites over the number of Levites. This payment to Aaron and his sons underscores the priestly role of the Levites and their service in the tabernacle. It highlights the principle of substitution and redemption, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, pointing forward to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ. Aaron, as the high priest, is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>as the redemption price</b><br>The concept of redemption is central to biblical theology. In this context, it refers to the act of buying back or substituting the firstborn Israelites with the Levites. This redemption price is a foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption through Christ, who paid the price for humanity's sins. The idea of redemption is also seen in the Passover, where the blood of the lamb redeemed the Israelites from death (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>for the excess among the Israelites.</b><br>The excess refers to the number of firstborn Israelites that exceeded the number of Levites. This required a monetary compensation to balance the difference, ensuring that each firstborn was accounted for by a Levite. This reflects God's meticulous care for order and fairness among His people. It also emphasizes the importance of the firstborn in Israelite culture, who held a special place in the family and were often seen as representatives of the family's strength and future. This principle of substitution and redemption is fulfilled in Christ, who is the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and who redeems all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is receiving instructions from God regarding the redemption of the firstborn.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and his sons</a></b><br>The priests who are to receive the redemption money for the firstborn Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, specifically the firstborn males who are being redeemed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for service to God, taking the place of the firstborn in service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, central to the Levitical service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_redemption.htm">The Principle of Redemption</a></b><br>The concept of redemption is central to God's relationship with His people.

Money here is not a casual payment; it represents life redeemed&#8212;pointing forward to <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, where the ultimate price is &#8220;the precious blood of Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

The fixed amount (five shekels per person, <a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>) showed that no one could bargain or reduce the cost; salvation is entirely on God&#8217;s terms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the excess</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for the excess&#8230;&#8221;
