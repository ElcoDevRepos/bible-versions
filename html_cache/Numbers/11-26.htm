The camp represents the central living area of the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Remaining in the camp suggests a physical separation from the tent, where the presence of God was more directly manifested. This sets the stage for an unexpected divine action outside the usual sacred space.<p><b>one named Eldad and the other Medad&#8212;</b><br>The mention of specific names indicates the personal nature of God's calling and empowerment. Eldad and Medad are not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture, suggesting that God can choose to work through individuals who may not have prominent roles or recognition. Their names, meaning "God has loved" and "affectionate" respectively, may reflect their character or God's favor upon them.<p><b>and the Spirit rested on them.</b><br>The resting of the Spirit signifies divine empowerment and approval. In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God coming upon individuals often enabled them to perform specific tasks or roles, such as prophecy or leadership. This event foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, where the Spirit rests on believers, empowering them for ministry and witness.<p><b>They were among those listed,</b><br>This indicates that Eldad and Medad were part of the seventy elders chosen to assist Moses. Being listed suggests they were recognized leaders within the community, chosen for their wisdom and ability to share in the burden of leadership. This selection process reflects the importance of communal recognition and accountability in leadership roles.<p><b>but they had not gone out to the tent,</b><br>Their absence from the tent, where the other elders gathered, underscores the unconventional nature of their prophetic experience. The tent of meeting was the designated place for encountering God's presence, yet God chose to act outside this established norm. This highlights God's sovereignty and freedom to work beyond human expectations and structures.<p><b>and they prophesied in the camp.</b><br>Prophesying in the camp signifies the extension of God's word and presence into the everyday life of the Israelites. Prophecy in the Old Testament often involved speaking God's truth, offering guidance, or foretelling future events. This act of prophesying within the camp suggests that God's message and presence are not confined to sacred spaces but permeate all areas of life. It also prefigures the New Testament understanding of the priesthood of all believers, where God's Spirit enables all to participate in His work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eldad_and_medad.htm">Eldad and Medad</a></b><br>Two men who were part of the seventy elders chosen to assist Moses.

Scripture records actual individuals, underscoring that God works through real people in real places (cf. <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Remained in the camp&#8221; highlights that divine activity is not confined to public religious settings; God meets His servants where they are (cf. <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Spirit rested on them</b><p>&#8226; The same Spirit who came upon the seventy elders at the tent also came upon these two in the camp, proving His sovereign freedom (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>; <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rested&#8221; signals empowerment for service, just as with Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The descent of the Spirit foreshadows Pentecost, when the Spirit fell on many without geographic restriction (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were among those listed</b><p>&#8226; Eldad and Medad had been chosen and named among the seventy, affirming God&#8217;s prior call (cf. <a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17</a>; <a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The listing confirms accountability; God&#8217;s servants are known and numbered by Him (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they had not gone out to the tent</b><p>&#8226; Though absent from the formal gathering, they were not excluded from God&#8217;s blessing&#8212;He honors obedience over location (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This illustrates that access to God&#8217;s power is by His grace, not merely by ritual attendance (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they prophesied in the camp</b><p>&#8226; Their prophecy validated the Spirit&#8217;s anointing, echoing Moses&#8217; wish that &#8220;all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-29.htm">Numbers 11:29</a>; cf. <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Public prophecy within the camp served as a witness to the entire community, encouraging faith and reverence (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word went forth beyond the central sanctuary, prefiguring the spread of the gospel to &#8220;Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-26.htm">Numbers 11:26</a> demonstrates that God&#8217;s Spirit cannot be restricted by location or human expectations. Eldad and Medad, though absent from the tent, receive the same Spirit, prophesy boldly, and confirm that the LORD freely empowers His chosen servants wherever they are. Their example encourages believers to trust God&#8217;s sovereign distribution of gifts and to remain ready for His Spirit&#8217;s work, whether gathered publicly or serving quietly in everyday settings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There remained two of the men</span> in <span class="cmt_word">the camp.</span> No reason is here given why they did not accompany the rest to the tabernacle; but as they did not thereby forfeit the gift designed for them, it is certain that some necessity or duty detained them. <span class="cmt_word">They were of</span> <span class="cmt_word">them that were written.</span> This incidental notice shows how usual the practice of writing was, at any rate with Moses, who was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (<a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they prophesied in the camp.</span> As a sign that they too had received the <span class="accented">charisma</span> from the Lord.
