Balaam, though a non-Israelite, is used by God to deliver a message to His people. This highlights God's sovereignty and ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes. Balaam's father, Beor, is mentioned to establish his prophetic credentials, as lineage was important in establishing authority and credibility in ancient cultures.<p><b>the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,</b><br>This phrase suggests that Balaam has received a special revelation or insight from God. In biblical terms, having "open eyes" often refers to spiritual enlightenment or the ability to perceive divine truths. This is significant because it indicates that Balaam's message is not based on his own understanding but on a vision or insight granted by God. This can be connected to other instances in Scripture where prophets receive visions, such as Isaiah or Ezekiel, and it foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his encounters with God and his oracles concerning Israel.

Moses delivering the Law at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel revealing God&#8217;s word to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s sovereign choice of even a pagan seer underscores His power to use anyone for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declaring the Message</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;saying&#8221; introduces inspired speech, setting it apart from Balaam&#8217;s earlier attempts to curse Israel for money (<a href="/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7, 18</a>).<p>- Prophetic statements carry divine authority; they are not suggestions but settled truth (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p>- By recording the exact words, Scripture emphasizes verbal inspiration&#8212;every word matters (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This Is the Prophecy of Balaam Son of Beor</b><p>- Naming the speaker establishes accountability: Balaam cannot claim ignorance or deny authorship.<p>- His lineage &#8220;son of Beor&#8221; grounds him in history, showing this event occurred in real time (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>).<p>- God brings a foreign diviner onto the biblical stage to bless Israel, fulfilling His promise to Abraham that those who bless Israel will be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>- Despite Balaam&#8217;s mixed motives (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>), God&#8217;s word through him is flawless (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Prophecy of a Man Whose Eyes Are Open</b><p>- &#8220;Eyes are open&#8221;

Spiritual discernment begins when God opens our eyes (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the unwilling can become instruments of blessing when God intervenes (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a> shows God empowering Balaam to deliver a genuine, God-breathed oracle of blessing over Israel.
