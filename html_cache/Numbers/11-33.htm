The people had complained about their hardships and expressed a desire for the foods they had in Egypt, showing a lack of gratitude for God's provision of manna. The meat refers to the quail that God provided in response to their complaints. The timing, "while the meat was still between their teeth," underscores the suddenness of the divine judgment, emphasizing that the people's sin was not just in their words but in their hearts and actions.<p><b>before it was chewed</b><br>This detail indicates that the judgment came swiftly, even before the people could enjoy the quail they had craved. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and ingratitude. The Israelites' desire for meat was not just a physical craving but a rejection of God's provision and a longing for their past life in Egypt, which symbolized a return to bondage and sin.<p><b>the anger of the LORD burned against the people</b><br>The phrase reflects God's righteous indignation towards the Israelites' rebellion and lack of faith. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness. This anger is not arbitrary but is a just response to the people's persistent disobedience and lack of trust in God's promises. It serves as a warning to remain faithful and obedient to God's commands.<p><b>and the LORD struck them with a severe plague</b><br>The severe plague represents a direct act of divine judgment. In the context of the wilderness journey, plagues were often used by God to correct and discipline His people. This particular plague was a consequence of the people's greed and rebellion. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the holiness of God. The use of plagues as a form of judgment is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the plagues of Egypt, and points to the ultimate judgment that will come upon unrepentant sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.

While Israel still savored the quail they demanded, God&#8217;s wrath fell, turning their feast into a funeral. The passage underscores that complaining against the Lord, doubting His provision, and indulging unchecked cravings invite serious consequences. Yet even this severe plague serves as a loving warning: trust the Giver more than His gifts, receive His provision with gratitude, and walk in obedient faith, for the LORD is both holy and abundantly good to those who rely on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">With a very great plague.</span>--The noun, <span class= "ital">maccah. </span>plague, is cognate to the verb which is rendered <span class= "ital">smote. </span>It is frequently used of a stroke inflicted by God, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>pestilence or any epidemic sickness. A surfeit, such as that in which the Israelites had indulged, especially under the circumstances in which they were placed, would naturally produce a considerable amount of sickness. Here, then, as in the account of the plagues of Egypt and in other parts of the sacred history, the natural and the supernatural are closely combined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed. If</span> this were taken in the most literal sense, it would mean that no one of the people had time to swallow a single morsel of the coveted food ere he was stricken down by the Divine visitation. <span class="accented">We can scarcely imagine, however</span>, that such was the case in every single instance. It would indeed appear as if they had with one consent postponed the enjoyment of eating the quails until they had gathered as huge a quantity for future use as possible; as if in defiance and contempt of the Divine warning that their greed would turn to satiety and loathing (see verses 19 and 32). If this were so, then the feast to which they so eagerly looked forward would begin throughout the camps on the second night, and the visitation of God might well have had the sudden and simultaneous character attributed to it here and in <a href="/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30, 31</a>. At any rate the statement of the text positively excludes the idea that they went on eating quails for a whole month, according to the promise (or threat) of verse 20. There was flesh enough to have secured the literal fulfillment of that promise by gorging them for a whole month; but it is evident that the Divine wrath anticipated any such tardy revenges, and smote its victims in the very moment of their keenest gratification. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord smote the people with a very great plague.</span> Both ancients and moderns state that the flesh of quails is unwholesome (cf. Pliny, 10:23), but this appears to have no very valid foundation. Unquestionably quails eaten for a month by people unused to a flesh diet would produce many and fatal sicknesses; but there is no room for any such natural results here. Whatever form the plague may have taken, it was as clearly supernatural in its suddenness and intensity as the supply of quails itself. We do not know anything as to who were smitten, or how many; the Psalmist tells us that they were "the fattest" and "the chosen in Israel, and we may naturally suppose that those who had been foremost in the lusting and the murmuring were foremost in the ruin which followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But while</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1433;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124;
