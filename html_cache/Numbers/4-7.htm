It held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and covenant with Israel. This table was a constant reminder of God's presence among His people. The table was made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, signifying purity and divinity. It points to Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), fulfilling the spiritual sustenance that the showbread symbolized.<p><b>they are to spread a blue cloth</b><br>The blue cloth represents the heavenly nature and divine service associated with the Tabernacle. Blue is often associated with the heavens and the divine in Scripture, reflecting the holiness and sacredness of the items it covered. This act of covering the table with a blue cloth signifies the separation of holy objects from common use, emphasizing the sanctity of worship.<p><b>and place the plates and cups on it</b><br>The plates and cups were used for the bread and drink offerings, essential components of the sacrificial system. These utensils were made of pure gold, indicating their sacred purpose. The careful placement of these items underscores the order and reverence required in worship, reflecting God's holiness and the need for purity in approaching Him.<p><b>along with the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, often wine, was poured out as a libation to the Lord, symbolizing the pouring out of one's life in service to God. This offering complements the grain and burnt offerings, representing a complete dedication to God. The use of bowls and pitchers highlights the organized and intentional nature of worship in the Tabernacle.<p><b>The regular bread offering is to remain on it</b><br>The regular bread offering, or showbread, consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel. It was a perpetual offering, replaced every Sabbath, signifying God's continual provision and the covenant relationship with His people. This bread is a type of Christ, who is the true sustenance for believers, as He declared Himself the Bread of Life.

Its very name points to continual fellowship with God; the bread set on it week by week testified that the twelve tribes always had a place before Him (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). Here the Kohathites are being told how to prepare that table for transport whenever Israel moved. By stressing the table first, Scripture underscores that relationship precedes ritual&#8212;God&#8217;s presence with His people is the central reality around which everything else is arranged (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to spread a blue cloth</b><p>&#8220;Blue&#8221; repeatedly marks what is closest to God&#8217;s holiness&#8212;the veil (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), the priestly robe (28:31), the tassels that reminded Israel of the commandments (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-40</a>). Covering the table with blue signaled that even in transit the holy things were not exposed to common view (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Like the blood-covered mercy seat hidden behind the veil, the blue cloth served as a protective boundary. For today&#8217;s believer, it hints at Christ&#8217;s own righteousness that shields us as we draw near (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Place the plates and cups on it</b><p>Next, the text says the Levites were to &#8220;place the plates and cups on it,&#8221; referring to the utensils fashioned for the showbread service (<a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Plates held the freshly baked loaves.<p>&#8226; Cups (or &#8220;flagons,&#8221; <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>) likely contained frankincense or beverages accompanying the bread.<p>Keeping these vessels together with the table shows that every detail of worship was integrated; nothing about God&#8217;s service was haphazard (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33, 40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering</b><p>The drink offering, poured out with many sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>; <a href="/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>), symbolized joyful dedication&#8212;wine surrendered to God. Paul borrows this image when he says, &#8220;I am already being poured out like a drink offering&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>). By packing the bowls and pitchers alongside the cups, the Levites made sure that every act of devotion connected to the bread of presence traveled intact. Holiness is not compartmentalized; our daily &#8220;pouring out&#8221; belongs right beside our covenant fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The regular bread offering is to remain on it</b><p>Finally, the verse insists: &#8220;The regular bread offering is to remain on it.&#8221; Even during transport, the showbread stayed in place. The Hebrew calendar might pause, but God&#8217;s provision never stops (<a href="/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). Twelve loaves&#8212;one for each tribe&#8212;affirmed that no member of God&#8217;s family is forgotten (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). When David ate this bread in need (<a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a>), it foreshadowed Christ who fulfills the law yet meets human hunger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a> teaches that God&#8217;s fellowship (the table), His holiness (the blue cloth), ordered worship (utensils), joyful surrender (drink offering), and unfailing provision (bread) all move with His people. Whether Israel camped or marched, every element stayed together, guarded and ready. In Christ, these same truths travel with us: we are continually before the Father, covered by His righteousness, equipped for orderly service, called to joyful self-offering, and sustained by the Bread of Life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And covers to cover withal.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the cups for the drink-offering </span>(or <span class= "ital">libation</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the continual bread.</span>--The shew-bread is so called because it was renewed every Sabbath day, and was continually before the face of the Lord even (as it appears from this verse) during the marches of the Israelites through the desert (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm" title="And you shall set on the table show bread before me always.">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal.</span> Rather, "the plates, the bowls, the wine pitchers, and the chalices for pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the drink offerings.
