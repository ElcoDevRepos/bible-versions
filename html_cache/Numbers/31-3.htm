This phrase highlights his role in communicating God's commands. Moses' leadership is crucial during the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, and his actions often prefigure Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>Arm some of your men for war</b><br>This directive involves preparing for battle, which was a common aspect of life in the ancient Near East. The Israelites were often engaged in conflicts as they journeyed through hostile territories. The call to arms signifies a divine mandate, emphasizing that this is not merely a human conflict but one with spiritual significance. The concept of spiritual warfare is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to put on the "armor of God" (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>).<p><b>that they may go against the Midianites</b><br>The Midianites were a nomadic people with whom the Israelites had previous interactions, both hostile and peaceful. Historically, the Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, making them distant relatives of the Israelites. This conflict is rooted in the events of <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, where the Midianites led Israel into idolatry and immorality, prompting divine judgment.<p><b>and execute the LORD&#8217;s vengeance on them</b><br>This phrase underscores the concept of divine justice. The vengeance is not personal retribution but a fulfillment of God's righteous judgment against sin. The Midianites' actions had led Israel astray, and this campaign serves as a corrective measure to uphold God's holiness. The idea of divine vengeance is seen throughout Scripture, culminating in the ultimate judgment at the end of times (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). This also foreshadows Christ's role in executing divine justice and establishing God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

In seducing the people of the Lord the Midianites had insulted and injured the majesty of God himself. On the question why Midian only, and not Moab also, was punished see on Numbers 25:17. It is to be remembered that, however hateful the sins of licentiousness and idolatry may be, they have never aroused by themselves the exterminating wrath of God. Midian was smitten because he had deliberately used these sins as weapons wherewith to take the life of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
