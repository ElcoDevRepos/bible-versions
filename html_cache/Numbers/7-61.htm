The silver platter, a significant and valuable item, symbolizes the wealth and dedication of the tribe. The weight of one hundred and thirty shekels, using the sanctuary shekel, indicates a standardized measure used in the tabernacle, ensuring fairness and consistency. This offering reflects the importance of giving one's best to God, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in the offerings of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>) and the widow's mite (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, was a valuable item, further emphasizing the tribe's commitment and reverence. The specific weight of seventy shekels again highlights the use of the sanctuary shekel, a unit of measure that was likely heavier than the common shekel, underscoring the substantial nature of the offering. This act of giving parallels the New Testament teaching of sacrificial giving, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where believers are encouraged to give generously and cheerfully.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard of weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring that all offerings were measured equally. This standardization reflects God's desire for order and fairness in worship, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>, where just balances and weights are commanded. The use of the sanctuary shekel also points to the centrality of the tabernacle in Israel's worship and community life, foreshadowing the role of Christ as the center of Christian worship and life (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, was a common offering in the Levitical system, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God. The use of fine flour indicates the quality and purity expected in offerings, pointing to the purity required in worship and service to God. The oil, often a symbol of the Holy Spirit, suggests the anointing and presence of God in the offering. This offering prefigures Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice, fulfilling the requirements of the law and providing spiritual sustenance for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahiezer.htm">Ahiezer</a></b><br>- The leader of the tribe of Dan, who presented the offering on the tenth day.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_dan.htm">Tribe of Dan</a></b><br>- One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its role in the settlement of the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_shekel.htm">Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>- A standard unit of weight used in the tabernacle for offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>- A type of offering made to God, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_and_obedience.htm">The Importance of Order and Obedience</a></b><br>The structured presentation of offerings by each tribe underscores the importance of order and obedience in worship.

Verse 61 pinpoints the ninth day when &#8220;Abidan son of Gideoni, the leader of the Benjamites&#8221; (v. 60) steps forward.<p>&#8226; The uniformity of every leader&#8217;s gift underscores Israel&#8217;s unity before the Lord (cf. <a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>, where the first presentation sets the pattern).<p>&#8226; Bringing an &#8220;offering&#8221; (Heb. qorban) highlights voluntary devotion, echoing earlier freewill sacrifices in <a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>.<p>&#8226; The text stresses that Abidan&#8217;s gift is no less and no more than that of the other tribes, modeling humble equality within the covenant community (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels</b><p>The first piece is a substantial serving dish, about 3 &#188; pounds (roughly 1.5 kg) of silver.<p>&#8226; Silver often symbolizes redemption (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, where silver ransom money is collected for the census), inviting readers to see dedication and redemption as inseparable.<p>&#8226; The generous weight shows costly honor given to the Lord, echoing David&#8217;s later words: &#8220;I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Plattery implies presentation; the grain (see below) is laid out publicly, reminding us that worship is both personal and communal (<a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><p>A smaller vessel&#8212;about 1 &#190; pounds (0.8 kg)&#8212;complements the platter.<p>&#8226; Two containers hint at completeness (wider platter, deeper bowl), paralleling Jesus&#8217; teaching that worship involves both outward service and inward devotion (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Silver again reinforces purity and tried faith (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The matching nature of these bowls across all tribes mirrors the New Testament picture of believers as &#8220;living stones&#8230;being built into a spiritual house&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><p>The measure is not arbitrary; it follows the temple standard established in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>.<p>&#8226; God, not man, sets the scale; worship must match His revealed pattern (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Uniform weights protect against partiality (<a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>).<p>&#8226; Using the sanctuary measure foreshadows the call to measure ourselves by Christ, &#8220;the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><p>The vessels are packed, not empty.<p>&#8226; Fine flour represents the best of daily sustenance (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Oil pictures the Spirit&#8217;s consecrating presence (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The grain offering is bloodless, highlighting thanksgiving and fellowship rather than atonement (<a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Abidan&#8217;s gift therefore celebrates redemption already secured and commits everyday resources to the Lord&#8212;a pattern echoed when believers present &#8220;your bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-61.htm">Numbers 7:61</a> records a leader&#8217;s precise, costly, and Spirit-symbolic gift, identical to those of his brothers, measured by God&#8217;s standard, and filled with life-sustaining flour.
