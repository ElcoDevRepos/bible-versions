This response comes after Joshua, Moses' assistant, expressed concern about others prophesying. Moses' reply reflects his humility and understanding of God's broader plan.<p><b>Are you jealous on my account?</b><br>Moses questions Joshua's motives, highlighting the potential for human jealousy and competition even among those serving God. This reflects a broader biblical theme where leaders must guard against pride and envy, as seen in the stories of Saul and David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7-9</a>).<p><b>I wish that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets</b><br>Moses expresses a desire for all of God's people to have the ability to prophesy, indicating an early understanding of the priesthood of all believers. This foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>, where the Holy Spirit is poured out on all flesh, allowing all believers to prophesy.<p><b>and that the LORD would place His Spirit on them!</b><br>The desire for God's Spirit to be on all people points to the future outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2), fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>.
