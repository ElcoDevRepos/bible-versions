The shoulder, being a significant portion of the animal, symbolizes strength and the offering of one's best to God. This act of taking the shoulder is part of the ritual completion of the Nazirite vow, signifying the end of a period of special dedication to God. The priest's role underscores the importance of mediation between God and the people, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>one unleavened cake from the basket</b><br>Unleavened bread is a recurring symbol in the Bible, often representing purity and the absence of sin, as leaven is typically associated with corruption. The unleavened cake here is part of the grain offering, which accompanies the peace offering. This reflects the Nazirite's commitment to holiness and separation from worldly influences during the vow. The use of unleavened bread connects to the Passover, where unleavened bread was eaten in haste, symbolizing readiness and purity.<p><b>and one unleavened wafer</b><br>The unleavened wafer, like the cake, signifies purity and dedication. It is part of the offerings that accompany the completion of the Nazirite vow. The wafer's inclusion highlights the comprehensive nature of the offerings, covering various aspects of sustenance and life. This act of offering unleavened items can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on spiritual purity and the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ.<p><b>and put them into the hands of the Nazirite</b><br>Placing these items into the hands of the Nazirite signifies the transfer of the offering from the priest to the individual who made the vow. It represents the personal nature of the vow and the individual's direct involvement in the act of worship and thanksgiving. This gesture emphasizes the personal responsibility and commitment of the Nazirite to God, a theme that resonates with the call for personal holiness and dedication in the life of a believer.<p><b>who has just shaved the hair of his consecration</b><br>The shaving of the hair marks the conclusion of the Nazirite vow, a period of separation and dedication to God. The hair, which was allowed to grow freely during the vow, symbolizes the Nazirite's consecration and devotion. Shaving it off signifies the end of this special period and the fulfillment of the vow. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfilled the law and the prophets, completing His mission of consecration and sacrifice for humanity. The hair, once a symbol of dedication, is now a testament to the vow's completion and the Nazirite's return to ordinary life, albeit with a renewed spiritual focus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who has taken a special vow of consecration to the Lord, characterized by abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>A religious leader responsible for performing sacrifices and rituals, acting as an intermediary between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ram.htm">Ram</a></b><br>An animal used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecrated_hair.htm">Consecrated Hair</a></b><br>The hair of the Nazirite, which is grown during the period of the vow and then shaved off as part of the completion ritual.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_bread.htm">Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Bread made without yeast, symbolizing purity and separation from sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_and_commitment.htm">Consecration and Commitment</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow is a profound commitment to God, symbolizing total dedication and separation from worldly influences.

He selects &#8220;the boiled shoulder,&#8221; a prime portion reserved from the peace (fellowship) offering (cf. <a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32&#8211;34</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The shoulder symbolizes strength and service; by receiving it cooked, the priest presents what is already prepared&#8212;nothing left for the Nazirite to add.<p>&#8226; Cross references emphasize that the priest customarily receives the right shoulder (<a href="/leviticus/8-25.htm">Leviticus 8:25&#8211;29</a>). Its transfer back to the Nazirite underscores shared fellowship: God, priest, and worshiper united at the vow&#8217;s completion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One unleavened cake from the basket</b><p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter the Nazirite brought &#8220;a basket of unleavened bread&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-15.htm">Numbers 6:15</a>). From that basket the priest now selects a single cake.<p>&#8226; Unleavened bread pictures purity and separation from sin (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7&#8211;8</a>). Its inclusion reminds the Nazirite that the vow&#8217;s entire period was to be marked by holy distinctness.<p>&#8226; The singular cake speaks of personal, individual devotion&#8212;one person fulfilling one vow before one God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And one unleavened wafer</b><p>&#8226; Alongside the thicker cake comes a thin wafer, also unleavened (<a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>). Two different textures of bread illustrate the fullness of the offering: every aspect of life, big or small, is consecrated.<p>&#8226; Both cake and wafer are without yeast, maintaining the lesson of holiness from beginning to end (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6, 11</a>&#8211;12 as a caution against &#8220;leaven&#8221; of false teaching).<p>&#8226; Their joint presentation balances substance (cake) with sensitivity (wafer), echoing <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>&#8212;walk humbly as well as act justly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And put them into the hands of the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration</b><p>&#8226; Shaving marked the formal conclusion of the vow (<a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18</a>). The Nazirite&#8217;s hands now hold the very pieces that will be waved before the Lord (cf. <a href="/exodus/29-24.htm">Exodus 29:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This transfer teaches:<p>&#8211; Ownership&#8212;what once belonged to God alone is momentarily entrusted to the worshiper (<a href="/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a> &#8220;the glory You have given Me I have given them&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Completion&#8212;the Nazirite physically feels the tangible proof that his vow is accepted (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a> &#8220;I have finished the race&#8221;).<p>&#8226; After the wave offering these items become the priest&#8217;s portion, picturing Christ our High Priest receiving what we dedicate (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-19.htm">Numbers 6:19</a> describes the climactic moment when vow-keeping meets God&#8217;s affirmation. The priest collects specific elements&#8212;the boiled shoulder, one unleavened cake, and one unleavened wafer&#8212;and places them in the Nazirite&#8217;s hands right after the shaving that signals vow fulfillment. Each item highlights purity, fellowship, and completed dedication. Together they show that when a believer sets something apart for the Lord and follows through, God graciously receives it, shares fellowship, and confirms the worshiper&#8217;s renewed standing in holy service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">sodden shoulder,</span> or boiled shoulder; the left.

That the other shoulder was also "waved" and accepted by God as his portion, to be consumed in his name by the priest, was a further token of the gracious acceptance of the self-dedication of the Nazirite, and of the fullness of eucharistic communion into which he had entered with his God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/6-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1436;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
