In the context of the Book of Numbers, this obedience is crucial as it sets the stage for their journey through the wilderness. The Israelites' compliance is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, highlighting the importance of following divine instructions. This obedience is contrasted with later instances of rebellion, such as the incident with the golden calf (Exodus 32) and the refusal to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14).<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded</b><br>The phrase underscores the direct communication between God and Moses, which is a central theme in the Torah. God's commands were not arbitrary but were given with purpose and precision. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's law was a sign of faithfulness. The phrase also points to the meticulous nature of the law, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle (Exodus 25-31) and the sacrificial system (Leviticus).<p><b>Moses</b><br>Moses is a pivotal figure in the Old Testament, serving as the mediator between God and the Israelites. His leadership is characterized by his faithfulness and humility (<a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>). Moses is a type of Christ, as both are seen as deliverers and lawgivers. In the New Testament, Jesus is often compared to Moses, but as one who brings a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). Moses' role in conveying God's commands to the people is foundational for understanding the structure and governance of Israel during their wilderness journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people.
