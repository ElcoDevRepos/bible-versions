Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, establishing him as a prophet and leader. Aaron, as the high priest, also holds a significant role in mediating between God and the Israelites. This divine communication underscores the seriousness of the message and the authority of God over His appointed leaders.<p><b>Because you did not trust Me</b><br>The lack of trust here refers to the incident at Meribah, where Moses struck the rock to bring forth water instead of speaking to it as God commanded (<a href="/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7-11</a>). This act demonstrated a failure to fully rely on God's instructions. Trust in God is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasized in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> and exemplified by figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>to show My holiness</b><br>Holiness is a central attribute of God, signifying His purity, separateness, and divine nature. By not following God's command precisely, Moses and Aaron failed to uphold God's holiness before the people. <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a> highlights the importance of sanctifying God in the eyes of the Israelites, a responsibility of the leaders.<p><b>in the sight of the Israelites</b><br>The public nature of Moses and Aaron's actions meant that their disobedience had a communal impact. The Israelites were witnesses to their leaders' failure to honor God, which could undermine their faith. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of leaders setting a godly example, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>.<p><b>you will not bring this assembly into the land</b><br>This consequence is significant, as it denies Moses and Aaron the fulfillment of leading the Israelites into the Promised Land, a task they had been working towards since the Exodus. This punishment reflects the principle that leaders are held to a higher standard (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>) and that disobedience has serious repercussions.<p><b>that I have given them</b><br>The Promised Land is a central element of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It represents God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises. Despite Moses and Aaron's failure, God's plan for the Israelites remains intact, demonstrating His sovereignty and grace.

Whatever was the nature of the sin thus committed, it is clear that Aaron was a participator in it with Moses. Some have thought that the sin of Moses consisted in addressing the people as rebels (or as rebellious ones); but this is the charge repeatedly brought against them in the book of Deuteronomy (see <a href="/numbers/1-26.htm" title="Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;">Numbers 1:26</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-43.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.">Numbers 1:43</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-23.htm" title="At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 9:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-27.htm" title="And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:">Numbers 31:27</a>), under circumstances in which it is impossible to suppose that Moses committed the same sin. It has also been thought that the sin of Moses and Aaron consisted in arrogating to themselves the honour which was due only to God. "Must <span class= "ital">we </span>fetch you water?" but the personal pronoun does not occur in the Hebrew, as it might, and probably would, have occurred, if intended to be emphatic. The more probable explanation appears to be that, notwithstanding the miraculous supply of water which had begun at Rephidim, and which had been subsequently continued, Moses and Aaron distrusted the word and power (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.">Numbers 20:12</a>) of God, and that they yielded to the impulse of impatience and anger, as betrayed both by the language which they used and by the double smiting of the rock, to which Moses had been commanded only to speak. To what degree Aaron was concerned in these sins can be inferred only from the facts that he, as well as Moses, was charged with the sin of unbelief, and that the punishment of exclusion from the land of Canaan was inflicted upon both. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of</span> Israel. It is very important, and at the same time very difficult, to understand what the precise sin of Moses and Aaron was upon this occasion. That it was very serious is manifest from the punishment which is entailed. Aaron, indeed, does not appear in the narrative, save in his usual subordinate position as associated with his brother by the Divine mandate. It has been said that he might have checked the unadvised words of Moses, but that is wholly beside the mark. Aaron had obviously no control whatever over his far more able and energetic brother, and therefore could have no responsibility in that respect. We can only suppose that he inwardly assented to the language and conduct with which he was outwardly associated, and therefore shared the guilt. A less degree of sin was (so to speak) necessary in his cause, because he had on former occasions so greatly dishonoured his office; and the anger of God against the sin of his ministers, although laid to sleep, is ever ready to awake upon the recurrence <span class="cmt_word">of</span> a similar provocation. We may therefore dismiss him, and consider only the case of Moses. It is impossible to suppose that Moses actually doubted the power of God to supply the present need, for he held in his hand the very rod with which he had struck the rock in Rephidim, nor is there anything in his words or acts upon this occasion to imply any such disbelief. The language of <a href="/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21, 22</a> may be cited on the other side, but that was spoken in passion, and spoken to God, and cannot be held as expressing an actual failure of faith. Nor do subsequent references point to unbelief as having been the sin of Moses (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>). Rather, they point to disobedience and indiscretion; to such disloyal conduct and language as produced a bad impression upon the people, and did not place the Divine character before them in its true light. We must understand, therefore, that the want of belief with which Moses stood charged was not a want of faith in the power of God, but a want of obedience to the will of God, bearing in mind that the two faults of disbelief and disobedience are but two sides of one inward fact, and are perpetually confounded in the language of Scripture (compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament). What then was the disobedience of Moses? Here, again, the more obvious answer is insufficient. It is true that Moses struck the rock twice instead of (or perhaps in addition to) speaking to it; but God had bid him take the rod, and he might naturally think he was meant to use it as before; moreover, the people could not have known anything of the exact terms of the command, and would have thought no more of his striking the rock at Kadesh than at Rephidim; but it was the fact of the bad impression made upon the people which was the ground of the Divine rebuke. We come back, therefore, to the simple conclusion expressed by the Psalmist (<a href="/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32, 33</a>), that Moses lost his temper, and in the irritation of the moment spoke and acted in such a way and in such a spirit as to dishonour his Master and to impair the good effect of the Divine beneficence. It is quite likely that the repeated striking of the rock was one sign of the anger to which Moses gave way, but we could hardly have attached any serious character to the act if it had stood alone. It is in the words of Moses, words in which he associated Aaron with himself, that we must find the explanation of the displeasure he incurred. That he called the people "rebels" was unseemly, not because it was untrue, or because it was an uncalled-for term of reproach, but because he himself was at that very moment a rebel, and disloyal in heart to his Master (cf. verse 24). That he should say, "Must we fetch you water out of this rock?" showed how completely he was carried away. It is true that God had said to him, "Thou shalt bring forth to them water," and, "Thou shalt give the congregation... drink" (compare this with <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), and it is probable that his own words were more or less consciously dictated by this remembrance; but he knew very well that the Divine mandate afforded him no real justification; that he and Aaron were the merest instruments in the hand of God; that it was peculiarly necessary to keep this fact before the minds of the people; nevertheless, his vexation and anger betrayed him into putting himself - a mere man, and a man too in a very bad temper - into the place of God before the eyes of the whole congregation. Moses had fallen at least once before (see on Numbers 11:11-15) into a similar error, one so natural to an angry mind; but this was the first time that he had made his error public, and thereby dishonoured the Master whom it was his special duty to uphold and glorify. This was the sin, and if the punishment seem disproportionate, it must be remembered that the heinousness of a sin depends quite as much on the position of the sinner as upon its intrinsic enormity. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not bring this</span> <span class="cmt_word">congregation into the land.</span> That they should die in the wilderness was implied in this sentence, but was not strictly a part of the sentence itself. Moses, indeed, although he did not enter the land of promise in its narrower sense, yet he died within the inheritance of Israel. Since they had behaved unworthily of their high office as leaders of the people, therefore that office should be taken from them before the glorious end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/20-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
