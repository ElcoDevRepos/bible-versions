The "field of Zophim" suggests a place of watching or observing, possibly a high vantage point. This location is significant as it indicates Balak's persistent efforts to find a place where Balaam's curse might be effective. The term "Zophim" can be linked to the Hebrew root for "watchers," suggesting a place where one might seek divine insight or revelation. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of seeking omens or signs from the gods.<p><b>to the top of Pisgah</b><br>Pisgah is a mountain range in Moab, often associated with Mount Nebo, from which Moses later views the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/34.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). This geographical detail underscores the strategic and spiritual significance of the location. Pisgah's height would provide a panoramic view, symbolizing the attempt to gain a comprehensive perspective on Israel. Theologically, it foreshadows Moses' own experience, highlighting the tension between divine promise and human opposition.<p><b>where he built seven altars</b><br>The number seven is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or perfection. Building seven altars indicates an attempt to achieve a full or perfect offering, perhaps to ensure the effectiveness of the curse. This act reflects the pagan practice of multiplying sacrifices to appease or manipulate deities. It contrasts with the singular altar and sacrifice system established by God for Israel, emphasizing the futility of Balak's efforts against God's chosen people.<p><b>and offered a bull and a ram on each altar</b><br>The bull and ram are significant sacrificial animals in ancient Near Eastern and Israelite worship. Bulls were often associated with strength and fertility, while rams were linked to leadership and authority. Offering these animals on each altar suggests an attempt to invoke powerful spiritual forces. In Israelite tradition, these animals were also used in various offerings, including sin and peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/9-3.htm">Leviticus 9:3-4</a>). This highlights the contrast between pagan practices and the divinely ordained sacrificial system of Israel. Theologically, it underscores the futility of Balak's actions, as true power and authority belong to God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse the Israelites, but who ultimately speaks only what God allows.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/field_of_zophim.htm">Field of Zophim</a></b><br>A location on the top of Pisgah, a mountain range, where Balak takes Balaam to observe the Israelites and attempt to curse them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pisgah.htm">Pisgah</a></b><br>A mountain range in Moab, offering a vantage point over the surrounding area, significant in biblical accounts for its strategic views.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_altars.htm">Seven Altars</a></b><br>The altars built by Balak and Balaam for sacrifices, symbolizing completeness or perfection in biblical numerology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite Balak's efforts to curse Israel, God's will prevails.
