This area was significant as it was the final encampment of the Israelites before entering the Promised Land. Moab was a territory inhabited by the descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew. The plains were a strategic location for the Israelites, providing a staging ground for their entry into Canaan. This setting underscores the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River was a critical geographical landmark for the Israelites. It represented the boundary between the wilderness and the Promised Land. Crossing the Jordan was symbolic of entering into God's promises. The river is often associated with new beginnings and spiritual renewal, as seen in the later baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist in the Jordan.<p><b>across from Jericho</b><br>Jericho was one of the first major cities the Israelites would encounter in Canaan. Its mention here foreshadows the upcoming conquest and the miraculous victory God would provide. Jericho's strategic location made it a key military target, and its fall would demonstrate God's power and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>Moses and Eleazar the priest</b><br>Moses, the leader of the Israelites, and Eleazar, the son of Aaron and the high priest, represent both civil and religious authority. Their partnership in issuing instructions highlights the integration of spiritual and communal leadership. Eleazar's role as priest emphasizes the importance of maintaining a covenant relationship with God during this transitional period.<p><b>issued the instruction</b><br>The issuing of instruction by Moses and Eleazar signifies the continuation of God's guidance through His appointed leaders. This moment reflects the importance of obedience to divine commands as the Israelites prepare to enter the Promised Land. The instructions given were likely related to the census and organization of the tribes, ensuring readiness for the challenges ahead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
