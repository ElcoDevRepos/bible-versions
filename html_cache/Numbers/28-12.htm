The use of fine flour signifies purity and quality, reflecting the best of what the people could offer to God. The mixing with oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit and anointing, indicating that the offering is set apart for a sacred purpose. The specific measurement of three-tenths of an ephah for each bull highlights the importance of precision and obedience in worship. This offering accompanies the burnt offering, which represents atonement and dedication to God. The bull, being a large and valuable animal, signifies a substantial offering, often associated with communal or national sacrifices. This practice points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect and final atonement for sin.<p><b>two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with the ram</b><br>The reduction in the amount of fine flour for the ram compared to the bull reflects the varying levels of offerings based on the type of animal sacrificed. The ram, often used in significant covenantal contexts, such as the binding of Isaac (Genesis 22), symbolizes substitutionary sacrifice. The grain offering's consistency in using fine flour and oil underscores the continuity of worship practices and the importance of maintaining purity and dedication in offerings. The ram's association with covenant and substitution further connects to the typology of Christ, who is both the fulfillment of the covenant and the ultimate substitute for humanity's sin. The precise measurements and ingredients in these offerings emphasize the need for careful adherence to God's instructions, reflecting a heart of obedience and reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were to bring their offerings and sacrifices as a form of worship and obedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices instituted by God for the Israelites, which included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were responsible for carrying out the sacrificial duties and maintaining the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for offerings highlight the importance of obedience to God's commands.

For every bull, the worshiper also brought &#8220;three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.&#8221; That sizable measure&#8212;roughly eleven quarts&#8212;highlights three truths:<p>&#8226; Proportionate devotion. A large animal calls for a large grain gift (<a href="/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9-10</a>). God ties the scale of giving to the scale of blessing, echoing <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>.<p>&#8226; Purity and excellence. Fine flour is sifted until only the best remains, matching the unblemished bulls (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20</a>) and foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s sinless perfection (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spirit-enabled worship. Oil, a frequent symbol of the Spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>), permeates the flour. Even obedience depends on divine empowerment&#8212;<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a> expresses the same principle.<p>By coupling costly livestock with costly produce, God teaches that true worship engages every part of life (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with the ram</b><p>When the sacrifice moves from bull to ram, the flour drops to &#8220;two-tenths of an ephah&#8221; (about seven quarts), showing God&#8217;s ordered fairness:<p>&#8226; Consistent ratios. Rams receive two-thirds of the bull&#8217;s grain, and lambs later get one-third (<a href="/numbers/28-13.htm">Numbers 28:13</a>), reflecting <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>&#8212;God is not a God of confusion.<p>&#8226; Considerate equity. A family able to offer only a ram still brings an offering scaled to their means (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7-10</a>). The standard is achievable yet meaningful for all.<p>&#8226; Covenant unity. Bulls, rams, and lambs share the same ingredients&#8212;flour plus oil&#8212;linking every worshiper to the same story that culminates in Christ&#8217;s once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p>The repeated phrase &#8220;mixed with oil&#8221; reminds us that ritual without the Spirit is lifeless (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>). Flour alone would be dry; oil makes it fragrant and useful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/28-12.htm">Numbers 28:12</a> shows worship that is proportional, pure, and Spirit-filled. Larger animals call for larger grain gifts, demonstrating God&#8217;s orderly and equitable expectations. Fine flour signals spotless devotion; oil speaks of the Spirit&#8217;s enabling presence. Together these offerings foreshadow the flawless, all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ and invite believers today to bring every resource and affection under the Lord&#8217;s gracious rule.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/28-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">along with three-tenths [of an ephah]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
