The "appointed time" underscores the importance of divine timing in worship and obedience, reflecting God's sovereignty and order. This concept of appointed times is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, where God establishes specific times for feasts and holy days, emphasizing the rhythm of worship in the life of the Israelites.<p><b>at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month</b><br>The timing of twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month (Nisan) is significant as it marks the beginning of Passover. Twilight, or "between the evenings," is a specific time that signifies transition and preparation. This precise timing is a reminder of the original Passover in Egypt, where the Israelites were instructed to sacrifice the lamb at twilight (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). The Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice brings deliverance from sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>in accordance with its statutes and ordinances.</b><br>The statutes and ordinances refer to the detailed instructions given by God for the observance of Passover, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. These include the selection of the lamb, the manner of its preparation, and the way it is to be eaten. This adherence to divine law highlights the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. The meticulous observance of these laws foreshadows the fulfillment of the law in Christ, who perfectly kept the law and became the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's redemption (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including those concerning the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were commanded to observe the Passover as a perpetual ordinance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant event and feast commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, marked by the sacrifice of a lamb and the application of its blood on the doorposts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/twilight.htm">Twilight</a></b><br>The specific time of day when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_sinai.htm">Wilderness of Sinai</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites received the law and instructions for observing the Passover.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites were instructed to observe the Passover "in accordance with all its statutes and ordinances."

The reference must, therefore, be to those statutes and ordinances respecting the Passover which were of permanent obligation. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/9-12.htm" title="They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.">Numbers 9:12</a>, where the ordinance respecting the time of observance is necessarily excluded.) Some of these are found in Exodus 12, whilst others of a later date are recorded in Leviticus 17 and Deuteronomy 16. It has been objected that three priests (for Nadab and Abihu were dead) could not sprinkle the blood of the large number of lambs which must have been slain. It must be remembered, however, (1) that there is no express injunction respecting the sprinkling of the blood on this occasion; and (2) that the priests were probably assisted at this time in the performance of some of their duties--as we are expressly informed that they were at the Passovers celebrated by Hezekiah and by Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm" title="And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.">2Chronicles 30:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-11.htm" title="And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.">2Chronicles 35:11</a>)--by the Levites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At even.</span> See on Exodus 12:6. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the rites of it, and according</span> to all <span class="cmt_word">the ceremonies thereof.</span> This must be understood only of the essential rites and ceremonies of the passover, as mentioned below (verses 11, 12). It is singular that no mention is made of the considerable departure which circumstances necessitated from the original institution. It was not possible, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to strike the blood of the lamb upon the lintel and the side-posts of the doors, because in the wilderness they had no doors. In after ages this rite (which was of the essence of the institution) was represented by the sprinkling of the blood of the lambs on the altar (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), but no command is on record which expressly authorized the change. In <a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-16</a> there is indeed a general direction, applying apparently to all domestic animals slain for food, that they be brought to the tabernacle to be slain, and that the priest sprinkle the blood upon the altar; and in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-7</a> there is an order that in future times the passover was only to be slain at the place which the Lord should choose. The actual practice in later ages seems to have been founded partly upon the command in Deuteronomy, which restricted the killing <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the passover to Jerusalem (not, however, to the temple), and partly on the command in Leviticus, which really applied (at any rate in the letter) to the time of wandering only. As the celebration of the paschal feast had apparently been neglected from the time of Joshua until that of the later kings (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-21.htm">2 Kings 23:21-22</a>.), they were no doubt guided in the observance of it by the analogy of other sacrifices in the absence of express commands. It would, however, be an obvious source of error to assume that the practice of the age of Josiah or Hezekiah was the practice of the earliest passovers; so far as these necessarily differed from the original institution, it is absolutely uncertain <span class="cmt_word">how</span> the difficulty was solved. Nothing perhaps better illustrates the mingled rigidity and elasticity of the Divine ordinances than the observance of the passover, in which so much of changed detail was united with so real and so unvarying a uniformity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to observe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124;
