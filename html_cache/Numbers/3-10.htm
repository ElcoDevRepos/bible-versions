The priesthood was a hereditary office, passed down through Aaron's lineage, emphasizing the importance of family and lineage in ancient Israelite society. This appointment is rooted in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, where God calls Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. The priesthood involved performing sacrifices, maintaining the sanctuary, and interceding for the people, highlighting the mediatory role between God and Israel. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>but any outsider who approaches the tabernacle must be put to death.&#8221;</b><br>This severe warning underscores the holiness of the tabernacle and the sanctity of the priestly office. The term "outsider" refers to anyone not of Aaron's lineage, emphasizing the exclusivity of the priesthood. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, are struck down for offering unauthorized fire. The death penalty for unauthorized access to the tabernacle underscores the seriousness of approaching God without proper mediation, pointing to the necessity of Christ's atoning work for access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
