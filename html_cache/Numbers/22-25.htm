This highlights the theme of spiritual blindness and the irony of a prophet being less perceptive than an animal. The "angel of the LORD" often represents God's direct intervention, as seen in other biblical narratives such as <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a> and <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>, where the angel acts as a divine messenger or even a theophany, a visible manifestation of God.<p><b>and pressed herself against the wall</b><br>The setting involves a narrow path with walls on either side, likely a vineyard or a rocky terrain common in the region of Moab. The donkey's action is a response to the divine presence, indicating an instinctual reverence or fear. This physical reaction underscores the seriousness of the divine encounter and the urgency of the message being conveyed.<p><b>crushing Balaam&#8217;s foot against it</b><br>This physical injury serves as a tangible consequence of Balaam's spiritual obstinacy. It symbolizes the pain and hindrance that result from resisting God's will. In a broader biblical context, physical afflictions often accompany spiritual lessons, as seen in Jacob's wrestling with God in <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-31</a>, where he is left with a limp as a reminder of his encounter with the divine.<p><b>So he beat her once again</b><br>Balaam's reaction reflects his frustration and lack of understanding of the situation. His repeated beating of the donkey shows his anger and impatience, traits that contrast with the patience and mercy often associated with God's character. This action also foreshadows Balaam's eventual realization and repentance, as God uses the donkey to open his eyes to the spiritual reality. The narrative emphasizes the theme of divine patience and the lengths to which God will go to communicate His will, even using unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

God opens the animal&#8217;s eyes to the unseen realm, while Balaam, the renowned seer, remains blind (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that God can grant spiritual perception to whomever&#8212;or whatever&#8212;He chooses, as when Elisha&#8217;s servant&#8217;s eyes were opened to the heavenly army (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that divine revelation is a gift, not a human achievement (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>); Balaam&#8217;s prophetic reputation is powerless without God&#8217;s enabling.<p>&#8226;

Pain is a divine alarm clock; the Lord uses affliction to arrest runaway hearts (<a href="/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67, 71</a>).<p>&#8226; The injury foreshadows how compromise always wounds the compromiser (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, the prophet who is supposed to bless or curse nations cannot even protect his own foot&#8212;highlighting the futility of resisting God (<a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he beat her once again</b><p>&#8226;

God will soon give the donkey a voice (<a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28</a>), showing He can use the lowliest instrument to rebuke pride (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-25.htm">Numbers 22:25</a> reveals a startling reversal: an ordinary donkey sees the angel of the LORD, acts to avoid judgment, and suffers for doing right, while the prophet, driven by greed, remains blind and lashes out.
