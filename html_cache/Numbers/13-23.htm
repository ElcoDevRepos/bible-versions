This area is known for its fertile land, which is evident from the abundance of fruit described in this passage. The name "Eshcol" means "cluster," which is fitting given the context of the story. Historically, Hebron is significant as it is associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were promised this land by God. The valley's fertility serves as a tangible confirmation of God's promise to give the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey.<p><b>they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes</b><br>The act of cutting down a branch with a single cluster of grapes highlights the extraordinary fertility of the land. Grapes were a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, used for making wine, which was a common beverage. The size of the cluster is emphasized, suggesting that the land was indeed bountiful and capable of sustaining the Israelites. This imagery of abundance is a foretaste of the blessings that God had in store for His people.<p><b>which they carried on a pole between two men</b><br>The need for two men to carry a single cluster of grapes on a pole underscores the extraordinary size and weight of the cluster, further emphasizing the richness of the land. This detail serves as a physical testament to the land's productivity and aligns with the biblical theme of God's provision. The use of a pole for carrying heavy loads was a common practice in ancient times, indicating the practical methods employed by the Israelites.<p><b>They also took some pomegranates and figs</b><br>Pomegranates and figs were also significant agricultural products in ancient Israel. Pomegranates are often associated with fertility and abundance, and they were used in various religious and cultural contexts, including the decoration of the priestly garments and the Temple. Figs were another important fruit, symbolizing peace and prosperity. The inclusion of these fruits in the report back to the Israelite community further illustrates the land's potential to fulfill God's promises. These fruits are also mentioned in other parts of Scripture as symbols of blessing and prosperity, reinforcing the message of hope and divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, were sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan.

Reaching the Valley of Eshcol (&#8220;cluster&#8221;), they stood on ground God had already promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). Their very arrival was a fulfillment-in-progress of the covenant first announced in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a> and later repeated in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>.

Similar language appears later in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7&#8211;9</a>, where grapes are singled out as evidence of abundance. The cluster served as a tangible proof of God&#8217;s intention to bless, echoing Jacob&#8217;s prophecy of agricultural plenty in <a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a> and foreshadowing Jesus&#8217; teaching, &#8220;I am the true vine&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>), which also centers fruitfulness in relationship with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which they carried on a pole between two men</b><p>The need for two carriers underscores the super-natural scale of the provision. <a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> celebrates such divine bounty: &#8220;You crown the year with Your goodness, and Your paths drip with abundance.&#8221; In <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a> we are reminded that God &#8220;is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.&#8221; The picture of the heavy cluster dramatizes the same truth: His gifts exceed human expectation and capacity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They also took some pomegranates and figs</b><p>These fruits round out the portrait of a land laden with every good thing (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> again names grapes, figs, and pomegranates together). Pomegranates later appear on the hem of the high priest&#8217;s robe (<a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>), symbolizing life and holiness. Figs become a prophetic sign of settled peace&#8212;&#8220;every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree&#8221; (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>).

The verse calls readers to trust His word, expect His abundance, and move forward in obedient faith rather than retreat in fearful unbelief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The brook of Eshcol.--</span>This is commonly identified with the valley of Hebron. Ritter says that the reputation of the grapes of Hebron is so great throughout all Palestine that there is no difficulty in believing that the valley of Eshcol was that which is directly north of the city of Hebron. The valley may have derived its name originally from Eshcol, the brother of Mamre the Amorite (<a href="/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>). In like manner the name of Mamre appears to have been transferred to the tree, or grove, of Mamre, which was opposite to the cave of Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/23-17.htm" title="And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure">Genesis 23:17</a>); and in this manner Eshcol is closely connected with Hebron in <a href="/genesis/23-19.htm" title="And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 23:19</a> as it is in the present chapter.<p><span class= "bld">Upon a staff.--</span>The majority of travellers concur in estimating the weight of the largest clusters commonly produced in Palestine at about ten or twelve pounds. Kitto, however, mentions an instance of a bunch of Syrian grapes produced in our own country weighing nineteen pounds, which was sent by the Duke of Portland to the Marquis of Rockingham, and which was carried more than twenty miles by four labourers, two of whom bore it by rotation upon a staff. The greatest diameter of this cluster was nineteen inches and a half (<span class= "ital">Pictorial Bible, </span>in loc., 1855). The arrangement referred to in the text was probably made, not because the weight was too great for one person to carry, but in order to prevent the grapes from being crushed. The pomegranates and figs, which are still some of the most important fruits of Hebron (see <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 583), were probably carried on the same pole. The words may be rendered thus: <span class= "ital">"And they bare it between two upon a staff; also some of the pomegranates and of the figs." </span>This incident has obvious reference to the homeward journey of the spies. As the grapes of Eshcol were to the Israelites both a pledge and a specimen of the fruits of Canaan, so the communion which believers have with God on earth is a pledge as well as a foretaste of the blessedness of heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">brook of Eshcol.</span> Rather, "the valley of Eshcol," for it is not a land of brooks. Probably between Hebron and Jerusalem, where the grapes are still exceptionally fine, and the dusters of great size. <span class="cmt_word">They bare it between two on a staff,</span> not on account of its weight, but simply in order not to spoil it.
