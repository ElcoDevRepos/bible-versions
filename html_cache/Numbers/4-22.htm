The Gershonites are one of the three main divisions of the Levites, alongside the Kohathites and the Merarites. This census is part of a broader organizational structure for the Israelites as they prepare to move through the wilderness. The census serves both a practical and spiritual purpose, ensuring that each clan knows its responsibilities in the service of the Tabernacle. The act of taking a census is significant in biblical history, often symbolizing God's care and order among His people.<p><b>by their families and clans,</b><br>The mention of "families and clans" highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. Each clan within the tribe of Levi had specific roles and duties related to the Tabernacle, and these were passed down through generations. This structure ensured that the sacred duties were carried out with precision and reverence. The emphasis on family and clan also reflects the communal nature of Israelite life, where identity and responsibility were closely tied to one's family group. This organization is seen throughout the Old Testament, where genealogies and tribal affiliations play a crucial role in the narrative and legal structures of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gershon.htm">Gershon</a></b><br>Gershon was the firstborn son of Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

The tribe of Levi did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes but was given cities and the responsibility of serving in the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The census mentioned in this verse was a counting of the Levites, specifically the Gershonites, to determine those who were eligible for service in the tabernacle. This was part of a larger organizational effort to ensure the proper functioning of the tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The tabernacle was the portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites.
