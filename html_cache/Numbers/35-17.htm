The reference to a "stone of deadly size" indicates a deliberate choice of a weapon capable of causing death. This phrase highlights the premeditated nature of the act, distinguishing it from accidental harm. The use of stones as weapons is seen in other biblical accounts, such as David and Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>), where a stone is used with lethal intent. The law here underscores the importance of intent and the responsibility of the individual wielding the weapon.<p><b>and he strikes and kills another</b><br>The act of striking with a stone implies direct and intentional violence. The Hebrew legal system made a clear distinction between accidental death and murder. This phrase emphasizes the action leading to death, which is crucial in determining culpability. The concept of "striking" is often associated with judgment and punishment in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, where striking a person resulting in death is explicitly addressed.<p><b>he is a murderer</b><br>This declaration identifies the individual as a murderer, not merely someone who caused a death. The term "murderer" is significant in biblical law, as it denotes a violation of the sixth commandment, "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). The distinction between murder and manslaughter is critical in biblical justice, with murder involving intent and premeditation. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and the sanctity of life.<p><b>the murderer must surely be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment reflects the seriousness of the crime. Capital punishment for murder is consistent with the principle of retributive justice found throughout the Old Testament. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> establishes the foundational principle: "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed." This reflects the value God places on human life, created in His image. The certainty of the punishment ("must surely be") underscores the importance of upholding justice and deterring future violence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Numbers were given, as they were preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were to inherit, where these laws would be applied.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cities_of_refuge.htm">The Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated places where someone who killed another unintentionally could flee for safety until a trial.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_avenger_of_blood.htm">The Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member of the deceased who had the right to seek justice for the murder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>The law underscores the value God places on human life, requiring justice for those who take it unlawfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intent_matters.htm">Intent Matters</a></b><br>The distinction between murder and manslaughter highlights the importance of intent in God's justice system.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_for_justice_and_mercy.htm">Provision for Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cities of refuge illustrate God's provision for both justice and mercy, allowing for due process and protection for the innocent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_condition.htm">Heart Condition</a></b><br>Jesus' teaching in the New Testament calls believers to examine their hearts, recognizing that anger and hatred are akin to murder.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The role of the avenger of blood and the community in administering justice reflects the collective responsibility to uphold God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_35_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 35:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_35_17_Life_s_sanctity_in_law.htm">How does Numbers 35:17 emphasize the sanctity of life in God's law?

Striking indicates purposeful force, not an inadvertent slip. <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a> clarifies, &#8220;Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must surely be put to death&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The result&#8212;death&#8212;completes the tragic progression. <a href="/bsb/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a> later outlines cities of refuge for accidental killers (vv. 11-15), underscoring that this scenario is different: no refuge is offered when intention is clear.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11&#8211;12</a> warns against those who say, &#8220;Let us lie in wait for blood,&#8221; reinforcing that God judges the violent heart behind the violent act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is a murderer;</b><p>&#8226; God labels the act plainly. The title &#8220;murderer&#8221; removes every excuse or euphemism.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> grounds this definition in creation: &#8220;Whoever sheds man&#8217;s blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man&#8221;. The sanctity of life flows from the imago Dei; to kill unlawfully is to assault God&#8217;s own image.<p>&#8226; Jesus upholds the same moral category in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, reminding His listeners that the command &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; remains, and even hateful anger shares its root.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a> presses further: &#8220;Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer.&#8221; The inner disposition matters as much as the outward deed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the murderer must surely be put to death.</b><p>&#8226; The repetition (&#8220;surely&#8221;) stresses certainty. Justice in Israel demanded the death penalty for intentional murder; mercy was reserved for the accidental killer. <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a> echoes, &#8220;If a man schemes and acts deliberately against his neighbor to kill him... you must take him from My altar to be put to death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This judicial action was carried out by the &#8220;avenger of blood&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>), but only after fair trial (v. 30). Human life was so precious that only the forfeiture of the murderer&#8217;s life could satisfy justice (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle of retributive justice is reiterated in the New Testament as a governmental responsibility: &#8220;He does not bear the sword in vain, for he is God&#8217;s servant, an avenger who brings wrath on the wrongdoer&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/35-17.htm">Numbers 35:17</a> establishes a clear progression&#8212;intentional possession of a lethal weapon, deliberate use leading to death, divine identification of the crime as murder, and the mandated penalty of capital punishment.
