This lineage is significant as it establishes his authority and position within the tribe of Issachar. The mention of his father, Zuar, helps to trace the genealogy and leadership within the tribe, which was important for maintaining order and structure among the Israelites. In the broader biblical narrative, genealogies often underscore the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs regarding their descendants.<p><b>was over the division</b><br>Nethanel's role as a leader "over the division" indicates his responsibility for organizing and managing the military and logistical aspects of the tribe of Issachar. This position required leadership skills and the ability to mobilize and direct the tribe during their journey through the wilderness. The divisions were part of the larger Israelite camp structure, which was meticulously organized as described in earlier chapters of Numbers. This organization reflects God's orderliness and the importance of community and leadership in fulfilling His plans.<p><b>of the tribe of Issachar</b><br>The tribe of Issachar, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's son Issachar.

Issachar's territory, located in the fertile Jezreel Valley, was significant for agriculture and trade. The tribe's inclusion in the march order highlights their importance and contribution to the collective journey of the Israelites.
