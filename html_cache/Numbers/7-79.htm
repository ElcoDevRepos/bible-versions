The silver platter, a significant and valuable item, symbolizes the wealth and dedication of the tribe. The weight of 130 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel, indicates a standardized measure, ensuring fairness and consistency in offerings. This reflects the importance of precision and integrity in worship. Silver, often associated with redemption, can be seen as a type of Christ, who redeems humanity.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, is a valuable item, emphasizing the importance of the offering. The specific weight of seventy shekels again underscores the use of the sanctuary shekel, highlighting the sacredness of the offering. The bowl's purpose, to hold the grain offering, signifies the sustenance and provision from God. In a broader biblical context, bowls are often used in temple service, symbolizing the vessel of God's blessings.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard unit of weight used in the tabernacle and later the temple, ensuring that all offerings met a divine standard. This standardization reflects God's order and justice, ensuring that all tribes contributed equally to the tabernacle's service. It also points to the idea that worship and offerings should be measured and intentional, not arbitrary.<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, represents the fruit of human labor and God's provision. Fine flour indicates purity and quality, while oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit. This offering is a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, pure and anointed by the Spirit. The grain offering was a voluntary act of worship, expressing gratitude and dedication to God, and it foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who offered Himself willingly for humanity's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahira_son_of_enan.htm">Ahira son of Enan</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Naphtali, who presented the offering described in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_naphtali.htm">Tribe of Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the son of Jacob and Bilhah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle_dedication.htm">Tabernacle Dedication</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the dedication of the Tabernacle, where leaders of each tribe brought offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_shekel.htm">Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>A unit of weight used in the sanctuary, indicating the standard for offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering made with fine flour and oil, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_and_structure_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Order and Structure in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed description of offerings highlights the importance of order and structure in worship, reflecting God's nature of orderliness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_grain_offering.htm">Symbolism of the Grain Offering</a></b><br>The grain offering, made of fine flour and oil, symbolizes dedication and thanksgiving.

Verse 78 names Ahira son of Enan, leader of Naphtali, and verse 79 records what he physically set before the LORD. This &#8220;offering&#8221; (Hebrew n&#7497;&#7695;&#257;&#7687;&#226;, a literal gift) was not a vague donation but a counted, weighed, visible act of worship&#8212;exactly as earlier leaders had done (<a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12-17</a>). Scripture consistently portrays such giving as a heartfelt duty (<a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-9.htm">1 Chronicles 29:9</a>) and a joyful privilege (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), underscoring that worship involves concrete obedience, not merely sentiment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels</b><p>The platter (or dish) is the first item, weighing about 3&#190; pounds. Silver, a costly metal (<a href="/genesis/44-2.htm">Genesis 44:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>), signals value and purity. In the tabernacle silver redeemed every firstborn (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), so this heavy dish silently proclaims redemption&#8217;s cost. By matching the weight of every other tribe&#8217;s platter (<a href="/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13, 19</a> etc.), the text stresses unity and equality among God&#8217;s people&#8212;no tribe buys greater favor through a larger gift (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><p>The second vessel (roughly 2 pounds) complements the first. Bowls held blood or flour in sacrificial rites (<a href="/exodus/37-16.htm">Exodus 37:16</a>). Seventy shekels, exactly the same for each tribe, reinforce that worship is governed by God&#8217;s instructions, not human improvisation (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). David would later dedicate captured silver bowls to the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a>), echoing this pattern of setting valuable vessels apart for holy service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><p>The sanctuary shekel provided a fixed standard (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a>). By specifying this measure, the verse protects against inflation, deceit, or regional variation. Every gram belongs to God and must be weighed on His scale&#8212;a reminder that &#8220;all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Literal weights anchor spiritual sincerity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><p>Inside each silver piece lay a grain offering (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-4</a>). Fine flour speaks of quality, oil of gladness and the Spirit&#8217;s anointing (<a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>). Unlike the blood offerings that atoned for sin, the grain offering expressed thanksgiving and dedication. By pairing costly metal with daily bread, Ahira shows that both wealth and sustenance are consecrated to the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-79.htm">Numbers 7:79</a> records a literal, weight-specific gift that combines valuable silver vessels with staple food, all measured by God&#8217;s own standard.
