Asher's name means "happy" or "blessed," reflecting Leah's joy at his birth (<a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>). The tribe was known for its prosperity and abundance, as prophesied by Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, where Asher is described as having rich food and providing royal delicacies. This prosperity is also echoed in Moses' blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>, where Asher is said to be blessed with children and favored among his brothers. The tribe's territory was located in the fertile region of northern Canaan, which contributed to its wealth.<p><b>The Imnite clan from Imnah:</b><br>Imnah, also spelled Jimnah, was one of the sons of Asher, and his descendants formed the Imnite clan. The mention of clans highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal organization in ancient Israelite society. Clans were sub-divisions within tribes, and they played a crucial role in maintaining social structure and inheritance rights. The Imnite clan, like other clans, would have had specific roles and responsibilities within the tribe of Asher.<p><b>The Ishvite clan from Ishvi:</b><br>Ishvi, another son of Asher, was the progenitor of the Ishvite clan. The naming of clans after individual ancestors underscores the patriarchal nature of Israelite society, where lineage and heritage were traced through male ancestors. The Ishvites, like other clans, would have contributed to the overall strength and identity of the tribe of Asher. The emphasis on clan divisions also reflects the organizational structure necessary for managing the large population of Israelites during their wilderness journey and subsequent settlement in Canaan.<p><b>And the Beriite clan from Beriah:</b><br>Beriah was another son of Asher, and his descendants formed the Beriite clan. The name Beriah means "in trouble" or "a gift," which may reflect circumstances surrounding his birth or a prophetic insight into his descendants' future. The Beriite clan, along with the other clans of Asher, would have been part of the collective identity and function of the tribe. The detailed listing of clans in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a> serves as a census to prepare the Israelites for the division of the Promised Land, ensuring that each tribe and clan received their rightful inheritance according to their numbers. This census also reflects God's faithfulness in preserving the tribes of Israel despite the challenges they faced in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Asher was the eighth son, born to Zilpah, Leah's maidservant.
