Instituted in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, it involves the sacrifice of a lamb and the marking of doorposts with its blood, symbolizing God's protection. This observance is a perpetual statute for the Israelites, serving as a reminder of God's salvation and covenant faithfulness. The Passover also prefigures Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice delivers believers from sin.<p><b>at its appointed time.</b><br>The timing of the Passover is crucial, as it is to be observed on the 14th day of the first month, Nisan (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). This specific timing underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the sacredness of His appointed times. The precise observance reflects God's order and sovereignty. In the New Testament, Jesus' crucifixion during Passover fulfills the typology of the Passover lamb, emphasizing the continuity of God's redemptive plan through history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people.

They may have been in doubt as to whether they were to keep it in the wilderness, and indeed they do not seem to have attempted to keep it again until they reached the promised land (see on Joshua 5:5, 6). The passover had indeed been made an "ordinance for ever," but only when they were come to the land which the Lord should give them (<a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24, 25</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>). Apart, therefore, from express command, it would have been doubtful whether the feast should not at least he postponed. Inasmuch, however, as they had been detained at Sinai by Divine direction (albeit partly in consequence of their own idolatry, but for which they might already have been "at home"), it pleased God that they should not lack the blessing and support of the passover at its proper season. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;The Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are to observe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Passover</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#257;&#183;sa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6453.htm">Strong's 6453: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pretermission, exemption, Passover</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at its appointed time.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4150.htm">Strong's 4150: </a> </span><span class="str2">Appointed time, place, or meeting</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/9-2.htm">Numbers 9:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/9-2.htm">OT Law: Numbers 9:2 Moreover let the children of Israel keep (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/9-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 9:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 9:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/9-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 9:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 9:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
