The tribe is known for its warrior spirit and played a significant role in Israel's history. Benjamin's territory was strategically located between the tribes of Judah and Ephraim, which often placed it at the center of political and military events. The tribe's loyalty to the house of David is notable, as seen in the support of King Saul, who was a Benjamite, and later in the division of the kingdom when Benjamin remained with Judah.<p><b>and their registration numbered 45,600.</b><br>This census was conducted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, near Jericho, as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. The number 45,600 represents the fighting men of the tribe of Benjamin, indicating a significant increase from the previous census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, where they numbered 35,400. This growth reflects God's blessing and the tribe's resilience despite the challenges faced during the wilderness journey. The census was crucial for organizing the military and distributing the land among the tribes. The increase in numbers also foreshadows the tribe's future prominence, as seen in the establishment of the monarchy under Saul and the later influence of figures like the Apostle Paul, a Benjamite, in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, Benjamin is one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

By naming Benjamin&#8217;s clans and noting their 45,600 fighting men, God certifies the tribe&#8217;s identity, protects its inheritance, and showcases His covenant faithfulness.
