These curtains were made of fine linen, symbolizing purity and holiness. The courtyard itself was a place where the Israelites could come to offer sacrifices and worship God, emphasizing the importance of approaching God with reverence. The curtains also provided a visual reminder of the separation between God and humanity due to sin, a theme that is resolved in the New Testament through the tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard</b><br>This specific curtain served as the entrance to the courtyard, allowing access to the tabernacle and altar. It was distinct from the other curtains, often more elaborately designed, symbolizing the way to approach God. This entrance can be seen as a type of Christ, who declared Himself to be "the way" to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The exclusivity of this entrance underscores the belief that there is only one way to God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>that surrounds the tabernacle and altar</b><br>The tabernacle and altar were central to Israelite worship, with the tabernacle representing God's dwelling among His people and the altar being the place of sacrifice. The surrounding courtyard provided a space for the community to gather and participate in worship. This arrangement highlights the communal aspect of worship and the centrality of God's presence in the life of the Israelites. The tabernacle itself is a precursor to the temple and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and the cords</b><br>The cords were used to secure the curtains and other elements of the tabernacle, ensuring stability and order. This detail, though seemingly minor, reflects the care and precision involved in worship and the construction of the tabernacle. It underscores the importance of order and structure in approaching God, as well as the need for everything to be done according to His instructions. The cords can also symbolize the strength and support found in God's commandments and promises.<p><b>all the service for these items</b><br>The service for these items involved the duties of the Levites, who were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle and its furnishings. This service was a sacred duty, highlighting the role of the Levites as mediators between God and the people. It points to the broader theme of service in the Bible, where believers are called to serve God and others. The Levites' service foreshadows the priesthood of all believers, as described in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, and ultimately points to Christ, our High Priest, who serves as the ultimate mediator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey.

If the courtyard were neglected, sacrifices at the altar and fellowship at the tabernacle could not proceed.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores teamwork: Gershonites for fabrics and cords, Kohathites for the holy furniture, Merarites for frames and bases (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-37</a>).
