The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where the offerer, priests, and sometimes the community would partake in the sacrificial meal, symbolizing peace and reconciliation with God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings due to their significance as symbols of leadership and strength. The number five can symbolize grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and abundance of the offering, as well as the offerer's desire to honor God with valuable and significant sacrifices.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in various offerings, including sin offerings, due to their availability and significance in pastoral societies. The male goat, in particular, was often associated with atonement and purification. The presence of five male goats in the peace offering underscores the offerer's intent to seek purity and favor from God, as well as to express gratitude for His provision and protection.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered ideal for sacrifices due to their innocence and purity. The use of five male lambs further emphasizes the theme of grace and divine favor. Lambs are often seen as types of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This connection foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who brings peace and reconciliation between God and humanity.<p><b>This was the offering of Elishama son of Ammihud.</b><br>Elishama, a leader of the tribe of Ephraim, presents this offering on behalf of his tribe. Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, often associated with fruitfulness and blessing. The mention of Elishama's lineage, "son of Ammihud," highlights the importance of family heritage and leadership within the tribal structure of Israel. This offering reflects the collective worship and dedication of the tribe, as well as their acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions from God regarding the offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were commanded to bring offerings for the dedication of the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_naphtali.htm">Tribe of Naphtali</a></b><br>The specific tribe mentioned in the context of <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>, which brought offerings on the twelfth day.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the offerings were made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering made to atone for sin, symbolizing purification and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sin_offering.htm">Understanding the Sin Offering</a></b><br>The sin offering in the Old Testament was a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice.
