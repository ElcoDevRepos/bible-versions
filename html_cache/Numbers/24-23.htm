Despite being hired by Balak to curse Israel, Balaam's oracles are divinely inspired blessings. This phrase indicates a continuation of his prophetic declarations. Balaam's role as a prophet outside of Israel highlights God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes. The term "oracle" suggests a message of divine origin, emphasizing the seriousness and authority of Balaam's words.<p><b>&#8220;Ah, who can live unless God has ordained it?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the belief in God's ultimate control over life and death. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>, which states that the life of every creature is in God's hand. The phrase suggests that human existence is contingent upon God's will, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that God is the giver and sustainer of life. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the one through whom all things were made and in whom all things hold together (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).

The phrase reminds us that the Lord sometimes repeats His messages so we do not miss them (<a href="/numbers/23-16.htm">Numbers 23:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12</a>).<p>- Balaam&#8217;s previous prophecies had already blessed Israel despite Balak&#8217;s wishes (<a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7&#8211;10</a>; 24:1&#8211;9). By saying &#8220;once more,&#8221; God shows that His purpose stands immovably (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- Repetition in Scripture underscores certainty; here it highlights God&#8217;s unstoppable plan for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Balaam lifted up an oracle</b><p>- &#8220;Oracle&#8221; points to a Spirit-given utterance, not a personal opinion (<a href="/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 15</a>&#8211;16). Balaam, though a flawed man, becomes a mouthpiece for divine truth&#8212;echoing how God can use whomever He chooses (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49&#8211;52</a>).<p>- The lifting up suggests a public, authoritative declaration. Just as Moses later &#8220;lifted up his voice&#8221; to bless Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), Balaam announces something meant for all to hear, showing God&#8217;s word is to be proclaimed openly (<a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ah</b><p>- This exclamation carries weight&#8212;similar to Isaiah&#8217;s &#8220;Woe&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>) or Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Alas&#8221; for unrepentant cities (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). It signals solemnity and urgency.<p>- Balaam is awed, perhaps even alarmed, at the revelation he is about to deliver. Encountering God&#8217;s sovereignty evokes reverence and, for rebels, dread (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who can live</b><p>- The question underlines human frailty. Life is not self-sustaining; we are contingent beings (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>).<p>- Even mighty nations fall if God withdraws life or favor (<a href="/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a>). Balaam&#8217;s rhetorical question hints that no power&#8212;neither Moab nor Israel&#8217;s foes&#8212;can survive apart from God&#8217;s sustaining hand (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>- It also anticipates later scriptural teaching that all life &#8220;flows from Him, and through Him, and to Him&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unless God has ordained it?</b><p>- The climax affirms absolute divine sovereignty. To &#8220;ordain&#8221; is to appoint or decree (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently teaches that God alone determines life&#8217;s span (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>) and the rise and fall of kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>- For Israel, this was comfort: their survival was not tied to Balak&#8217;s curses but to God&#8217;s covenant promise (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>).<p>- For Moab and every nation, it was warning: opposing God&#8217;s ordained plan is futile (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p>- Personally, it calls believers to humility and trust&#8212;our times are in His hands, so we submit our plans to His will (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-23.htm">Numbers 24:23</a> declares that life itself&#8212;and every national destiny&#8212;rests solely on God&#8217;s sovereign decree. Repeating His message, God uses even Balaam to proclaim that no one can live, thrive, or stand apart from His ordination. The verse therefore comforts God&#8217;s people with assurance of His governing care and warns His enemies of the futility of resisting His will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">When God doeth this.--</span>These words may be rendered, <span class= "ital">since </span>(or, <span class= "ital">from the time that</span>)<span class= "ital"> God sets </span>(or, <span class= "ital">determines</span>)<span class= "ital"> it </span>(or, <span class= "ital">this</span>)--<span class= "ital">quando faciet ista Deus </span>(Vulgate); or, <span class= "ital">because God determines it </span>(or, <span class= "ital">this</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When God doeth this.</span> Literally, "from the settling of it by God." <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, i.e., when God shall bring these terrible things to pass.
