His name means "friend of God" or "God is my peace," reflecting a common practice of the time to incorporate the name of God into personal names. Zurishaddai, his father, means "my rock is the Almighty," which emphasizes the faith and reliance on God that was expected of the leaders of Israel. The genealogical mention underscores the importance of lineage and tribal affiliation in Israelite society, which was organized around family and tribal units. This structure was crucial for maintaining order and identity among the Israelites.<p><b>was over the division of the tribe of Simeon</b><br>The tribe of Simeon was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Simeon, the second son of Jacob and Leah. In the wilderness, the tribes were organized into divisions for the purpose of orderly travel and encampment. Each division had a leader, and Shelumiel was responsible for the military and administrative oversight of the Simeonites. Historically, the tribe of Simeon was smaller and less prominent compared to other tribes, which is reflected in their later absorption into the tribe of Judah. The division of the tribes into specific roles and responsibilities highlights the importance of order and leadership in fulfilling God's plan for Israel. This organization also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member has a specific role and function.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are journeying from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence of God among the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_sinai.htm">Wilderness of Sinai</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites camped and received the Law from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloud_of_the_lord.htm">Cloud of the Lord</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence that guided the Israelites on their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were guided by the cloud, believers today are guided by the Holy Spirit.

His name appears whenever leadership duties arise, showing consistency and reliability in service (compare <a href="/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>; 10:19).<p>&#8211; The verse reminds us that God appoints identifiable leaders for specific tasks; this echoes the pattern seen with Judah&#8217;s Nahshon (<a href="/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>) and Gad&#8217;s Eliasaph (v. 20).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>son of Zurishaddai</b><p>&#8211; Scripture repeatedly pairs Shelumiel with his father, grounding him in a godly lineage (<a href="/numbers/1-6.htm">Numbers 1:6</a>;

compare the orderly ranks around the tabernacle in <a href="/numbers/2-1.htm">Numbers 2:1-34</a>.<p>&#8211; Shelumiel&#8217;s charge reflects spiritual oversight as well as logistical command, paralleling later tribal governors under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/22-1.htm">Joshua 22:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the tribe of Simeon</b><p>&#8211;
