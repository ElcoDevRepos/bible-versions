In the biblical context, when God speaks, it is a declaration of His sovereign will. This echoes the creation narrative in Genesis where God speaks the world into existence. It also reflects the prophetic tradition where God's word is seen as powerful and unchangeable (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and I will surely do these things</b><br>This underscores God's faithfulness to His word, both in promises and judgments. It reflects the certainty of divine action, reminiscent of God's covenantal faithfulness seen throughout the Old Testament, such as His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the fulfillment of those promises despite human unfaithfulness.<p><b>to this entire wicked congregation</b><br>The term "wicked congregation" refers to the Israelites who rebelled against God by refusing to enter the Promised Land. This rebellion is detailed in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, where the people, influenced by the negative report of the spies, doubted God's promise. The term "wicked" highlights their lack of faith and disobedience, which is a recurring theme in Israel's wilderness journey.<p><b>which has conspired against Me</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate and collective rebellion against God's authority. The conspiracy involved rejecting God's appointed leaders, Moses and Aaron, and desiring to return to Egypt (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). This act of rebellion is seen as a direct affront to God's leadership and provision, similar to the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16).<p><b>They will meet their end in the wilderness</b><br>This is a pronouncement of judgment, where the consequence of their unbelief is to die in the wilderness rather than enter the Promised Land. This judgment is a direct result of their lack of faith and serves as a warning to future generations about the seriousness of disobedience to God. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching on the consequences of unbelief (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p><b>and there they will die.</b><br>The finality of this statement emphasizes the seriousness of God's judgment. The wilderness becomes both a physical and spiritual place of death for the faithless generation. This serves as a typology of spiritual death resulting from sin and rebellion, contrasting with the life and rest promised in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>). The wilderness experience is a powerful reminder of the need for faith and obedience to enter into God's rest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is just and holy, and who speaks with authority and finality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evil_congregation.htm">The Evil Congregation</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who rebelled against God by refusing to enter the Promised Land due to fear and lack of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years as a consequence of their disobedience and lack of trust in God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites who interceded on behalf of the people, pleading for God's mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites were initially afraid to enter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's response to the Israelites' rebellion highlights the seriousness of disobedience and lack of faith.

The Israelites are reminded that the voice they challenged in unbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>) is the same voice that brought creation into existence (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will surely do these things</b><p>&#8226; The adverb &#8220;surely&#8221; leaves no room for ambiguity; divine judgment is as certain as divine promise (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s actions flow from His holiness and covenant faithfulness&#8212;He does exactly what He has pledged, whether in blessing or in discipline (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226;

Instead of entering a land &#8220;flowing with milk and honey,&#8221; they would wander until the unbelieving generation was gone (<a href="/numbers/26-64.htm">Numbers 26:64&#8211;65</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is not impulsive;

Even in judgment, God&#8217;s faithfulness is seen&#8212;He safeguards His redemptive plan by removing persistent unbelief (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a> is God&#8217;s solemn verdict on a generation that heard His promises yet chose fear over faith.
