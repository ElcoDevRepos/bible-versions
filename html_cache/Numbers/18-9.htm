The "most holy offerings" refer to sacrifices that were considered sacred and were to be handled with utmost reverence. These offerings were typically burnt on the altar, but a portion was reserved for the priests. This provision underscores the principle that those who serve at the altar should share in the offerings of the altar (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>). The fire symbolizes God's consuming holiness, and the reserved portion signifies God's provision for His servants.<p><b>From all the offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings,</b><br>The offerings rendered to God as "most holy" include various sacrifices prescribed in the Mosaic Law. These offerings were acts of worship and atonement, reflecting the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. The phrase emphasizes the exclusivity and sanctity of these offerings, which were to be given directly to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of giving God the first and best of what one has (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). The offerings were a tangible expression of devotion and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>whether grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings,</b><br>This part of the verse lists specific types of offerings. Grain offerings were typically made of fine flour and oil, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving. Sin offerings were made to atone for unintentional sins, highlighting the need for purification and forgiveness. Guilt offerings, or trespass offerings, were made for specific transgressions, often involving restitution. Each type of offering had its own significance and ritual, reflecting different aspects of the Israelites' relationship with God. These offerings foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and provided atonement for sin once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>that part belongs to you and your sons.</b><br>This phrase establishes the hereditary nature of the priesthood, as the sons of Aaron were to inherit the priestly duties and privileges. The provision of offerings for the priests and their families ensured their sustenance, allowing them to focus on their sacred duties without concern for material needs. This arrangement highlights the importance of supporting those who minister in spiritual matters (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>). It also points to the concept of spiritual inheritance, where believers are considered a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), sharing in the blessings and responsibilities of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The primary recipients of the instructions in <a href="/bsb/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, Aaron and his sons were appointed as priests to serve in the tabernacle, responsible for the sacred duties and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where sacrifices and offerings were made to God.
