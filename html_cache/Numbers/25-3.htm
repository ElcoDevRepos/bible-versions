Baal of Peor refers to a local manifestation of the Canaanite god Baal, worshiped at Peor, a location in Moab. The Israelites' involvement in this idolatry was not merely a religious error but a breach of their covenant with Yahweh, who had commanded exclusive worship. This act of idolatry is linked to the seduction by Moabite women, as described earlier in the chapter, which led the Israelites into both sexual immorality and idol worship. The worship of Baal often included fertility rites and rituals that were in direct opposition to the laws given to Israel. This event is a stark reminder of the dangers of syncretism and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. It also foreshadows future struggles Israel would face with idolatry, as seen in the books of Judges and Kings.<p><b>and the anger of the LORD burned against them</b><br>The phrase highlights God's righteous indignation towards Israel's unfaithfulness. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting in divine judgment or discipline. In this context, it underscores the seriousness of Israel's sin and the breach of their covenant relationship with God. The burning anger signifies not only God's displeasure but also His holiness and justice. This divine response serves as a warning to the Israelites and future generations about the consequences of turning away from God. It also points to the need for atonement and repentance, themes that are fulfilled in the New Testament through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the wrath of God for humanity's sins. This incident is a precursor to the later teachings of the prophets, who called Israel back to faithfulness and warned of the consequences of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, who at this time was journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.
