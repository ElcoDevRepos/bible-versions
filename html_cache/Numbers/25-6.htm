The Israelite man, identified later as Zimri, son of Salu, a leader of a Simeonite family, brings a Midianite woman, Cozbi, daughter of a Midianite leader, into the camp. This act of bringing a foreign woman into the Israelite community was a direct violation of God's commands against intermarriage with pagan nations, which could lead to idolatry (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>), and their involvement in leading Israel into sin is significant, as it shows the recurring theme of Israel's struggle with surrounding nations and their gods.<p><b>in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>The public nature of this act underscores its brazenness and the depth of Israel's rebellion. Moses, as the leader and prophet, represents God's authority, and the congregation represents the community of God's people. This act of defiance occurs openly, suggesting a breakdown in the fear of God and respect for His commandments. It also highlights the communal aspect of sin and its potential to lead others astray, emphasizing the need for communal accountability and holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The weeping of the Israelites at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting indicates their awareness of sin and its consequences. The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>). The weeping suggests a moment of repentance and mourning over the plague that had struck the people as a result of their idolatry and immorality with the Moabite and Midianite women (<a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25:1-5</a>). This setting underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for atonement and divine intervention. The Tent of Meeting as a type of Christ points to Jesus as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, offering forgiveness and reconciliation through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were in a covenant relationship with Him.
