In this context, Moses laying hands on Joshua signifies the transfer of leadership. This practice is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the ordination of priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a>) and the commissioning of the seven deacons in the early church (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>). It represents a public acknowledgment of God's choice and the empowerment of the individual for a specific task.<p><b>and commissioned him</b><br>Commissioning involves appointing someone to a specific role or task. Here, Joshua is being appointed as the leader of Israel, succeeding Moses. This commissioning is not just a human decision but a divine mandate, as Joshua is to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. The concept of commissioning is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus commissions His disciples to spread the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), indicating a continuity of God's mission through chosen leaders.<p><b>as the LORD had instructed</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of divine guidance and obedience to God's commands. Moses acts according to God's specific instructions, highlighting the theme of obedience that runs throughout the book of Numbers. It reflects the biblical principle that leadership and authority come from God and must align with His will. This obedience is crucial for the success of Joshua's leadership and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses serves as the intermediary between God and the people of Israel, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Jesus Christ. Just as Moses faithfully conveys God's instructions to the people, Jesus is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). This phrase also emphasizes the continuity of God's plan, as the leadership transition from Moses to Joshua is part of the divine strategy to bring Israel into the Promised Land. Moses' role as a prophet and leader is foundational, and his actions set a precedent for future leaders in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Scripture regularly pairs the laying on of hands with blessing and impartation: Jacob blesses Ephraim and Manasseh this way (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>), Aaron transfers sin to the scapegoat (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>), and the apostles set apart servants for ministry (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture communicates three truths:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s authority is real and can be publicly recognized.<p>&#8211; Leadership comes from God, not personal ambition.<p>&#8211; Spiritual empowerment accompanies the call (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> notes that Joshua was &#8220;filled with the spirit of wisdom&#8221; after Moses laid hands on him).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and commissioned him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and commissioned him&#8230;&#8221;

It carries both a promise and a charge:<p>&#8211; Promise: God&#8217;s abiding presence (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8211; Charge: courage and careful obedience to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By passing on the commission, Moses models servant leadership that prepares the next generation (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a> reminds believers to do the same).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD had instructed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;as the LORD had instructed&#8230;&#8221;

<a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Following divine instruction ensures the transition is blessed and fruitful; ignoring it leads to confusion and loss (contrast <a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a>, where Moses&#8217; partial obedience cost him entrance into Canaan).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through Moses</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;through Moses.&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God works through chosen servants;

The pattern anticipates later transitions&#8212;Elijah to Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9-15</a>) and ultimately Jesus commissioning the apostles (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a> records a divinely directed transfer of leadership.
