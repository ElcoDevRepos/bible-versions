This genealogy is significant as it establishes the daughters' rightful claim to their father's inheritance. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, lineage and inheritance were typically passed through male descendants, making the mention of daughters noteworthy. This sets the stage for a legal and cultural shift regarding inheritance rights.<p><b>the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh</b><br>This lineage traces back to Manasseh, one of Joseph's sons, who was born in Egypt. Manasseh was one of the two tribes that descended from Joseph, the other being Ephraim. The mention of Gilead and Machir highlights the family's connection to the land east of the Jordan River, which was allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh. This geographical context is important as it underscores the daughters' claim to land that was part of their ancestral heritage.<p><b>belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph</b><br>The reference to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph emphasizes the tribal structure of Israelite society. Each tribe was divided into clans, which were further divided into families. This structure was crucial for maintaining order and distributing land among the Israelites. The daughters' association with the clan of Manasseh underscores their legitimate place within the tribal system and their right to seek an inheritance.<p><b>These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah</b><br>The naming of Zelophehad's daughters is significant as it personalizes their story and highlights their individual identities. In biblical narratives, the naming of women is often associated with important events or roles they play. The inclusion of their names in the text underscores the importance of their legal case and the precedent it sets for future generations. Each name carries its own meaning and cultural significance, reflecting the values and hopes of their family.<p><b>They approached</b><br>The act of approaching indicates a bold and proactive step taken by the daughters. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women typically did not have the same legal standing as men, especially in matters of inheritance. Their approach to the leaders of Israel demonstrates courage and a desire for justice. This action sets a precedent for addressing legal and social issues within the community, highlighting the importance of advocacy and the pursuit of equity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A descendant of Manasseh, son of Joseph.
