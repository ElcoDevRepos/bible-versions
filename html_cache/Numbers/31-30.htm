The spoils were divided into two equal parts: one for the warriors who fought and one for the rest of the community. This division reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where both those who fought and those who stayed behind shared in the benefits of victory. It also underscores the principle of fairness and shared responsibility within the community.<p><b>take one out of every fifty</b><br>This instruction establishes a specific portion of the spoils to be set aside for a particular purpose. The ratio of one out of fifty indicates a tithe-like offering, though it is distinct from the traditional tithe. This allocation demonstrates the importance of supporting religious functions and those who serve in them, ensuring that the Levites, who had no inheritance of land, were provided for.<p><b>whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or other animals</b><br>The inclusion of both people and animals in this list highlights the comprehensive nature of the spoils. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, captives and livestock were common spoils. The mention of various types of animals reflects the agrarian context of the Israelites and the economic value these animals represented. The inclusion of persons, likely referring to captives, also raises ethical considerations about the treatment of war captives in ancient times.<p><b>and give them to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties and the service of the tabernacle. They did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, so provisions like this were essential for their sustenance. This allocation underscores the community's responsibility to support those who minister on their behalf, a principle echoed in the New Testament regarding the support of church leaders.<p><b>who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the Levites' role in maintaining the tabernacle, the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. The tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple and a type of Christ, symbolizing God's presence with His people. The Levites' service was crucial for the spiritual life of the nation, and their support ensured the continued worship and adherence to the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is conveying God's instructions regarding the division of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have just returned from a victorious battle against the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for the service of the LORD&#8217;s tabernacle, responsible for its care and maintenance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_midianites.htm">The Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_tabernacle.htm">The LORD&#8217;s Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred dwelling place of God among His people, requiring care and service by the Levites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_generosity.htm">Stewardship and Generosity</a></b><br>God&#8217;s people are called to support those who serve in ministry.

By providing for the Levites who guarded the tabernacle, the nation honored the Lord&#8217;s presence and proclaimed that all possessions, victories, and lives belong to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">One portion of fifty.</span>--The Levites were much more numerous than the priests, and consequently it was ordered that they should have two per cent. of the spoil which fell to the congregation, whereas the priests had only one-fifth percent, of a like amount. The portion of the Levites, therefore, was 320 maidens, 6,750 sheep and goats, 720 oxen, and 610 asses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One portion of fifty.</span> Two percent of the prey. This probably corresponded very closely to the number of Levites as compared with the twelve tribes, and would tend to show that God intended the Levites to be neither better nor worse off than their neighbours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">half,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1510;&#1460;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mim&#183;ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;i&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124;
