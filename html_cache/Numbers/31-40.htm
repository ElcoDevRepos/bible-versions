In the context of ancient warfare, it was common for victors to take captives. The number 16,000 indicates the scale of the victory and the significant population of the Midianites. This event is part of the broader narrative of Israel's journey to the Promised Land, where they encountered various hostile nations. The sparing of these women aligns with the cultural practices of the time, where women and children were often taken as captives. This also reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where men were typically the combatants.<p><b>including a tribute to the LORD of 32</b><br>The tribute of 32 people to the LORD signifies a portion set aside as holy, acknowledging God's role in granting victory. This act of giving a tribute is a form of offering, similar to the firstfruits or tithes, which were common in Israelite worship. The number 32, being a small fraction of the total, highlights the principle of dedicating a portion of one's gains to God, a practice that underscores the recognition of divine providence. This tribute can be seen as a precursor to the concept of dedicating one's life to God, a theme that runs throughout the Bible. It also foreshadows the ultimate tribute of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), offering His life as a sacrifice for many.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are involved in the battle against the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people who were defeated by the Israelites as a judgment from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord.htm">LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel to whom the tribute is given.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribute.htm">Tribute</a></b><br>The portion of the spoils dedicated to the LORD, signifying His sovereignty and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The tribute to the LORD signifies the acknowledgment of His ultimate authority and ownership over all things.
