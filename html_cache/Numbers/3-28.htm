The Levites were set apart for service to God, and this census was crucial for determining their roles and responsibilities. The age of "a month old or more" indicates that even infants were counted, emphasizing the importance of every male in the service of the sanctuary. The number 8,600 reflects the size of the Kohathite clan, which was one of the three main divisions of the Levites, alongside the Gershonites and Merarites. This census is part of a broader narrative where God organizes the Israelites for their journey and worship, highlighting the importance of order and structure in worship.<p><b>They were responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.</b><br>The Kohathites had specific responsibilities related to the sanctuary, which included the care and transportation of the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role required a high level of sanctity and reverence, as these items were central to Israel's worship and represented God's presence among His people. The duties of the sanctuary were a foreshadowing of the priestly work of Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our High Priest, mediating between God and humanity. The Kohathites' service underscores the theme of holiness and the need for dedicated individuals to maintain the sanctity of worship, a principle that carries through to the New Testament church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for the service of the Tabernacle, responsible for its care and the duties associated with worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The sacred place where God's presence dwelled among the Israelites, requiring careful maintenance and reverence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, responsible for organizing the Levites and ensuring the proper worship of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>A counting of the Levite males, emphasizing the importance of order and structure in the service of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, central to Israelite worship and community life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Order in Worship</a></b><br>God values order and structure in worship, as seen in the detailed organization of the Levites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_service_in_the_community_of_faith.htm">The Role of Service in the Community of Faith</a></b><br>The Levites' dedication to the sanctuary reminds us of the importance of serving within our faith communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacredness_of_god's_presence.htm">The Sacredness of God's Presence</a></b><br>The responsibilities of the Levites underscore the holiness of God's presence and the reverence required in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_responsibility.htm">Generational Responsibility</a></b><br>The census of males a month old or more indicates the ongoing responsibility of each generation to uphold the worship and service of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_readiness_and_dedication.htm">Spiritual Readiness and Dedication</a></b><br>Just as the Levites were set apart for service, believers today are called to be spiritually ready and dedicated to God's work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_3_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 3:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_3_28_Spiritual_leadership_s_role.htm">How does Numbers 3:28 emphasize the importance of organized spiritual leadership today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Levites_for_church_service.htm">What can we learn from the Levites' role in Numbers 3:28 for church service?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_3_28_to_NT_church_order.htm">How does Numbers 3:28 connect with New Testament teachings on church order?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Numbers_3_28_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the principles of Numbers 3:28 in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Guard_duty_in_Numbers_3_28_vigilance.htm">How does "guard duty" in Numbers 3:28 relate to spiritual vigilance in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_mention_8_600_Levites_in_Num_3_28.htm">What is the significance of the 8,600 Levites mentioned in Numbers 3:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_3_28_Israelite_camp_structure.htm">How does Numbers 3:28 reflect the organization of the Israelite camp?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_Levites_chosen_in_Numbers_3_28.htm">Why were the Levites specifically chosen for duties in Numbers 3:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_korah_oppose_moses_and_aaron.htm">Why did Korah rebel against Moses and Aaron?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_herod_the_great.htm">Who was Ithamar in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/priests_vs._levites__role_differences.htm">How do priests and Levites differ in their roles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_22,000_levites_plausible_then.htm">Numbers 3:39 -

Moses and Aaron were sons of Amram, and they seem to have had but two sons apiece at this time. If, therefore, the family of the Amramites was at all equal in numbers to the other three, they must have had more than 4000 brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. It is urged in reply that Amram lived 137 years, and may have had many other children, and that the variations in the comparative rates of increase are so great and so unaccountable that it is useless to speculate upon them. There is, however, a more serious difficulty connected with the genealogy of Moses and Aaron, as given here and elsewhere. If they were the great-grandchildren of Levi on their father's side, and his grandchildren on their mother's side, it is impossible to maintain the obvious meaning of <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>. Either the genealogy must be lengthened, or the time must be very much shortened for the sojourning in Egypt. The known and undoubted habit of the sacred writers to omit names in their genealogies, even in those which seem most precise, lessens the difficulty of the first alternative, whereas every consideration of numbers, including those in this passage, increases the difficulty of the second. To endeavour to avoid either alternative, and to force the apparent statements of Scripture into accord by assuming a multiplicity of unrecorded and improbable miracles at every turn (as, e.g., that Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was restored to youth and beauty at an extreme old age), is to expose the holy writings to contempt. It is much more reverent to believe, either that the genealogies are very imperfect, or that the numbers in the text have been very considerably altered. Every consideration of particular examples, still more the general impression left by the whole narrative, favours the former as against the latter alternative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/3-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The number</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;mis&#183;par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
