The law required that wrongs be righted by compensating the victim or their family. This phrase highlights a situation where the wronged party has no living relatives to receive restitution. This reflects the importance of family and kinship in Israelite society, where family lines were crucial for inheritance and social structure. The absence of a relative underscores the communal responsibility to uphold justice even when direct family ties are absent.<p><b>the restitution belongs to the LORD</b><br>In the absence of a human recipient, restitution is directed to God, signifying that all justice ultimately belongs to Him. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where God was seen as the ultimate judge and authority. The restitution being directed to the LORD emphasizes the sacredness of justice and the belief that God is the protector of the vulnerable and the wronged. This principle is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which speaks of lending to the LORD by giving to the poor.<p><b>and must be given to the priest</b><br>The priests served as intermediaries between God and the people, and they were responsible for maintaining the spiritual and ritual purity of the community. By giving the restitution to the priest, the act becomes a sacred offering, acknowledging God's sovereignty and the priest's role in administering divine justice. This also provided for the sustenance of the priesthood, as they had no inheritance of land and relied on offerings for their livelihood, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>.<p><b>along with the ram of atonement</b><br>The ram of atonement is a sacrificial offering that signifies the need for reconciliation with God. Sacrifices were central to the Israelite system of worship and atonement, symbolizing the seriousness of sin and the need for divine forgiveness. The inclusion of the ram highlights the dual aspect of restitution: addressing the wrong done to another person and the offense against God. This foreshadows the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, who is often typified as the sacrificial lamb in the New Testament (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>by which the atonement is made for him</b><br>Atonement involves the removal of sin and the restoration of a right relationship with God. In the Old Testament, this was achieved through prescribed sacrifices and offerings. The phrase underscores the necessity of atonement for reconciliation with God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. The sacrificial system points to the ultimate atonement made by Christ, whose death and resurrection provide the final and complete means of reconciliation for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). This connection emphasizes the continuity of God's plan for redemption from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_no_close_relative.htm">The Man with No Close Relative</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who has committed a wrong and needs to make restitution but has no living family member to receive it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of restitution when no earthly relative is available, signifying God's sovereignty and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who receives the restitution on behalf of the LORD, highlighting the priestly role in the atonement process.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram_of_atonement.htm">The Ram of Atonement</a></b><br>An offering made to atone for the wrong, symbolizing the need for sacrifice in the process of reconciliation with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restitution.htm">Restitution</a></b><br>The act of making amends for a wrong, emphasizing the importance of justice and restoration in the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_restitution.htm">The Importance of Restitution</a></b><br>Restitution is a biblical principle that underscores the need for justice and reconciliation.
