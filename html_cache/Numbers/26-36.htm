Ephraim and Manasseh were adopted by Jacob as his own sons, which gave Joseph a double portion among the tribes of Israel. This lineage highlights the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Ephraim, where he was prophesied to become a multitude of nations (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). The descendants of Shuthelah represent a continuation of this blessing and the growth of the tribe of Ephraim.<p><b>were the Eranite clan</b><br>The term "Eranite" refers to the descendants of Eran, a son of Shuthelah. In the context of the Israelite tribal system, clans were sub-divisions within a tribe, often named after a prominent ancestor. This structure was important for maintaining family heritage and land inheritance, as well as organizing the people for military and religious purposes. The mention of the Eranite clan underscores the importance of family lineage and identity within the Israelite community.<p><b>from Eran</b><br>Eran is a lesser-known figure in the Bible, but his mention here signifies the importance of every family line within the tribes of Israel. Each clan played a role in the larger narrative of Israel's history and journey to the Promised Land. The name Eran itself, meaning "watchful" or "vigilant," may reflect the characteristics valued by the clan. This phrase also emphasizes the detailed record-keeping and genealogical interest that is a hallmark of the Pentateuch, ensuring that each family group is accounted for in the census of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shuthelah.htm">Shuthelah</a></b><br>A descendant of Ephraim, one of the sons of Joseph.
