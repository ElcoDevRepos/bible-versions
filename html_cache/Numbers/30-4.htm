This phrase indicates the father's authority and responsibility over his daughter's commitments. The cultural context of the time placed significant importance on vows, as they were considered binding promises made before God. The father's awareness of the vow suggests his role in overseeing and guiding the spiritual and practical decisions of his household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of parental responsibility and authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>, where fathers are instructed to bring up their children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.<p><b>but says nothing to her</b><br>The father's silence in this context implies consent. In the cultural and historical setting of ancient Israel, silence could be interpreted as agreement or acceptance. This principle is consistent with other biblical passages where silence or lack of objection is taken as tacit approval, such as in the case of Boaz and the nearer kinsman in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-8</a>. The father's lack of objection allows the vow to stand, highlighting the importance of communication and the weight of unspoken consent within familial and community relationships.<p><b>then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness and binding nature of vows in the biblical context. Vows were not to be taken lightly, as they were promises made before God, and breaking them was considered a sin (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). The passage emphasizes personal responsibility and integrity, as the daughter is held accountable for her commitments. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the importance of keeping one's word (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled His promises and commitments, exemplifying faithfulness and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_women.htm">Israelite Women</a></b><br>The specific group addressed in this passage, particularly daughters living in their father's house.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>The male heads of households who had authority over their daughters' vows.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows_and_obligations.htm">Vows and Obligations</a></b><br>Commitments made by individuals, often involving promises to God or others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_community.htm">The Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which these laws were given, emphasizing communal and familial responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_authority_and_accountability.htm">The Importance of Authority and Accountability</a></b><br>In the biblical context, the father's role in hearing and either affirming or nullifying a daughter's vow underscores the importance of authority and accountability within the family structure. This principle can be applied today by recognizing the value of seeking wise counsel and accountability in decision-making.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_vows.htm">The Seriousness of Vows</a></b><br>Vows are not to be taken lightly.

This teaches us that inaction or silence can be as powerful as spoken words. In our relationships and commitments, we should be aware of how our responses&#8212;or lack thereof&#8212;can impact others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_communication.htm">The Value of Communication</a></b><br>Open communication within families and communities is vital.

The father knows exactly what she promised to the LORD (compare <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, where Job &#8220;arose early&#8221; because he knew what his children may have done).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently places responsibility on those in authority to respond to what they know (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But says nothing to her</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but says nothing to her&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Silence here is deliberate, not ignorance. Like Eli reacting (or failing to) in <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22-25</a>, the father&#8217;s response&#8212;or lack of it&#8212;carries weight.<p>&#8226; By not speaking, he withholds veto power the Law grants him (<a href="/numbers/30-5.htm">Numbers 30:5</a>). His silence functions as tacit approval (cf. <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>, where remaining silent still counts as a choice).<p>&#8226; The verse underlines personal accountability; when authority chooses not to intervene, the individual remains responsible for the vow (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;All&#8221; stresses completeness; there is no selective enforcement. Every word spoken to the LORD stands together (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bound herself&#8221; reveals voluntary self-obligation. Although under her father&#8217;s authority, she willingly assumed duty before God (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Vows in Scripture are sacred, not casual promises. They often involve offerings, fasting, or lifelong commitments (<a href="/leviticus/27-1.htm">Leviticus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shall stand</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;shall stand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The vow becomes legally and spiritually fixed. Breaking it would mean sin (<a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors orderly authority structures yet upholds individual integrity. When father and daughter align&#8212;either by approval or silence&#8212;the agreement is binding (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-20.htm">Colossians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This principle foreshadows Christ&#8217;s teaching that our &#8220;Yes&#8221; should be &#8220;Yes&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>). Divine faithfulness expects human faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/30-4.htm">Numbers 30:4</a> teaches that when a young woman in her father&#8217;s house makes a vow to the LORD and her father, fully informed, chooses silence, the vow remains in force. His silent consent transfers full responsibility back to her; every promise holds, none can be revoked later. The passage affirms the seriousness of vows, the weight of parental authority, and God&#8217;s expectation that promises made before Him be kept.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/30-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and her father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
