Being ceremonially clean was essential for participating in religious activities, including the Passover. This requirement underscores the importance of holiness and purity in worship, reflecting God's nature and His expectations for His people.<p><b>and is not on a journey</b><br>The mention of not being on a journey implies that the person has no legitimate excuse for missing the Passover. In ancient Israel, travel could prevent participation in communal religious observances. The Passover was a central event, commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, and it required the presence of all eligible members of the community.<p><b>still fails to observe the Passover</b><br>The Passover was a critical observance for the Israelites, as it was a reminder of God's deliverance and covenant with His people. Failure to observe it, especially without a valid reason, indicated a disregard for God's commands and the community's shared history. This neglect could be seen as a rejection of God's salvation and provision.<p><b>he must be cut off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies a severe consequence, often interpreted as excommunication or even death. This punishment reflects the seriousness of the offense, as it disrupts the unity and purity of the community. It also serves as a deterrent, emphasizing the importance of obedience and communal responsibility in maintaining a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>because he did not present the LORD&#8217;s offering at its appointed time</b><br>The Passover involved specific offerings and rituals that had to be performed at a designated time. This requirement highlights the importance of timing and order in worship, reflecting God's sovereignty and the need for His people to align with His divine schedule. The failure to present the offering signifies a breach in the covenant relationship and a lack of reverence for God's commands.<p><b>That man will bear the consequences of his sin</b><br>The phrase underscores personal responsibility and accountability before God. In the biblical context, sin has consequences, both spiritual and communal. This principle is consistent throughout Scripture, where disobedience leads to separation from God and His blessings. It also foreshadows the ultimate consequence of sin, which is spiritual death, and points to the need for atonement and redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The covenant people of God, called to obedience and holiness as they journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>An essential observance commanded by God, commemorating the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and pointing to the ultimate redemption in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_offering.htm">The LORD&#8217;s Offering</a></b><br>Refers to the lamb or substitute offered during the Passover as a reminder of God&#8217;s provision and protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The Israelites&#8217; period of wandering, representing a time of testing and spiritual formation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/being_cut_off.htm">Being Cut Off</a></b><br>A term denoting separation from the covenant community and divine blessings, symbolizing the severity of disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_priority_of_obedience.htm">The Priority of Obedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God's clear commands&#8212;such as keeping the Passover&#8212;was considered rebellion against His authority.
