Its construction was detailed and precise, reflecting the importance of divine instruction in worship. The lampstand's design was not arbitrary but followed a specific divine blueprint, emphasizing the need for obedience to God's commands.<p><b>it was made of hammered gold:</b><br>Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was chosen for its durability and beauty. The process of hammering indicates skilled craftsmanship and the care taken in its creation. This method also signifies the shaping and refining process, akin to how God refines His people. Gold's use in the Tabernacle highlights the value and holiness of the objects within.<p><b>from its base to its blossoms:</b><br>The description from base to blossoms suggests completeness and attention to detail. The base represents stability, while the blossoms, likely almond flowers, symbolize life and fruitfulness. This imagery connects to the idea of spiritual growth and the flourishing of faith under God's guidance.<p><b>fashioned according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses:</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the Tabernacle's design.

Back in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31&#8211;40</a>, the LORD had already spoken in detail to Moses about the lampstand (menorah). Here, in the assembling of the Tabernacle, Moses reports that every word of that earlier instruction has now been carried out exactly. The phrase &#8220;This is how&#8221; underlines the reliability of the biblical record&#8212;what God says, His people do. It also signals to later generations (see <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11&#8211;13</a>, where David gives Solomon similar &#8220;blueprints&#8221;) that worship is never self-styled but God-directed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was made of hammered gold</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pure gold&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>) speaks of holiness. Only the finest, unalloyed material could stand in the presence of the Holy One.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hammered&#8221; means the entire lampstand was beaten out of a single piece, emphasizing unity. No joints, no seams&#8212;just as Israel was called to be one people and the church is &#8220;one body&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold also reflects and amplifies light. <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12&#8211;13</a> shows the risen Christ walking among &#8220;seven golden lampstands,&#8221; underscoring continuity from Tabernacle to heavenly throne room.<p>&#8226; The costliness reminds us that approaching God is never cheap; it anticipates the priceless blood of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From its base to its blossoms</b><p>The lampstand was shaped like a flourishing almond tree:<p>&#8226; Base&#8212;solid support, hinting at God&#8217;s steadfast foundation (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Shaft and branches&#8212;sevenfold completeness, pointing to the &#8220;seven spirits of God&#8221; before the throne (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Blossoms&#8212;life and fruitfulness.

Noah built the ark &#8220;as God commanded&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>); Moses does the same here.<p>&#8226; It also teaches assurance.

The repetition of the statement in this place seems to be conclusive that these verses are out of their historical position, and that their insertion here is due to some fact connected with the original records with which we are not acquainted. It may be simply this, that these verses originally followed verse 89 of the previous chapter, and followed it still when it was inserted, for reasons already suggested, after the narrative of the offerings of the princes. Why, or how, such an admission should discredit the sacred narrative or imperil the truth of its inspiration it would be hard to say. The only thing really likely to imperil the sacred narrative is to persistently deny the obvious literary conclusions which arise from an honest consideration of the text. <p> CHAPTER 8:5-26 THE HALLOWING OF THE LEVITES (verses 5-23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
