Reuben was Jacob's firstborn, but his tribe did not maintain a position of leadership due to Reuben's transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>). The tribe of Gad was known for its warriors (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). These tribes were part of the larger Israelite community that had been wandering in the wilderness for 40 years after the Exodus from Egypt.<p><b>who had very large herds and flocks</b><br>The mention of large herds and flocks indicates the wealth and prosperity of these tribes. In ancient Near Eastern culture, livestock was a primary measure of wealth and economic stability. The patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were also known for their large flocks, which signified God's blessing and provision (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2, 26</a>:12-14, 30:43).<p><b>surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead</b><br>Jazer and Gilead were regions east of the Jordan River. Jazer was a city and its surrounding territory, while Gilead was a larger region known for its balm, a valuable commodity (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). These areas were part of the land that Israel was to conquer and settle. The surveying of the land suggests a strategic assessment for settlement, similar to the earlier spying of Canaan (Numbers 13).<p><b>and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock</b><br>The suitability of the land for livestock indicates fertile pastures and abundant resources, essential for sustaining large herds. This observation aligns with the promise of a "land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), emphasizing God's provision. The decision to settle here reflects a practical consideration for the tribes' economic needs, but it also foreshadows potential challenges in unity and obedience to God's command to settle west of the Jordan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites.htm">Reubenites</a></b><br>Descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob.

Simeon, however, was at this time enfeebled and disgraced, and was not likely to assert himself in any way. The "great multitude of cattle" belonging to the two tribes probably point to pastoral habits of long standing, since the cattle of the Amorites and Midianites would be equally divided among all. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Jazer.</span> Jazer, or Jaazer, probably stood near the northern source of the Wady Hesban, which enters the Jordan not far from its mouth. The "land of Jazer" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, "all the cities of the Mishor"). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead.</span> Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>); but more properly it denoted the lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name "Mount Gilead" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8, 9</a>) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">place for cattle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>), and is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> in verse 4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/32-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the Reubenites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
