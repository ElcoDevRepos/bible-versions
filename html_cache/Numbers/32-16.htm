Their approach to Moses signifies a moment of negotiation and decision-making. Moses, as the leader and prophet, was the intermediary between God and the Israelites. This approach indicates a formal request, highlighting the tribal structure and leadership dynamics within the Israelite community. Historically, this moment occurs as the Israelites are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, having journeyed from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for 40 years.<p><b>&#8220;We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock</b><br>The request to build sheepfolds reflects the pastoral lifestyle of these tribes. Livestock was a primary source of wealth and sustenance, indicating their economic priorities. The land east of the Jordan River, where they were currently located, was fertile and suitable for grazing, making it an attractive option for these tribes. This request also shows a desire for stability and settlement, contrasting with the nomadic life they had led. The mention of sheepfolds suggests a need for protection and management of their herds, which were vital to their livelihood.<p><b>and cities for our little ones.</b><br>The mention of cities for their little ones underscores the importance of family and community. It reflects a concern for the safety and future of their children, indicating a long-term vision for settlement. Building cities implies a shift from a temporary, nomadic existence to a more permanent, structured society. This request also highlights the cultural emphasis on family and the continuation of the tribal lineage. The desire for cities suggests an understanding of the need for defense and organization, as cities would provide protection and a center for community life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_reuben_and_gad.htm">The Tribes of Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>These tribes approached Moses with a request to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, as the land was suitable for their large herds of livestock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was approached by the tribes of Reuben and Gad with their request.
