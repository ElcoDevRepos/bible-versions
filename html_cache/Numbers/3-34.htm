The Levites were set apart for service in the tabernacle, and this census was crucial for organizing their duties. The age of "a month old or more" indicates that even infants were counted, emphasizing the importance of every male in the tribe for future service. This practice reflects the cultural and religious significance of the firstborn and the dedication of the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn of Israel (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>). The inclusion of infants highlights the continuity of service and the preparation for future generations to uphold the sacred duties.<p><b>was 6,200</b><br>The specific number of 6,200 males in the Gershonite clan underscores the detailed record-keeping and organization within the Israelite community. This number is significant in understanding the distribution of responsibilities among the Levites. The Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and other fabric elements (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>). The precision of this count reflects the orderly nature of God's instructions to Moses and the importance of each clan's role in the worship and movement of the Israelites. This meticulous attention to detail is mirrored in other biblical accounts, such as the genealogies in 1 Chronicles, which also emphasize the importance of lineage and duty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle.

In setting apart the tribe of Levi for His service&#8212;&#8220;in place of every firstborn&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12</a>)&#8212;the Lord orders a careful census. Verses 33-34 zoom in on Merari, one of Levi&#8217;s three sons. This clause about 6,200 males sits in the flow of:<p>&#8226; Gershon: 7,500 males (<a href="/numbers/3-22.htm">Numbers 3:22</a>)<p>&#8226; Kohath: 8,600 males (<a href="/numbers/3-28.htm">Numbers 3:28</a>)<p>&#8226; Merari: 6,200 males (<a href="/numbers/3-34.htm">Numbers 3:34</a>)<p>Together, &#8220;all the Levites numbered 22,000&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-39.htm">Numbers 3:39</a>), a precise figure God will use when He exchanges the firstborn of Israel for the Levites (<a href="/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who are the Merarites?</b><p>Merari&#8217;s two sons&#8212;Mahlite and Mushite clans (<a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>)&#8212;form the 6,200 males counted. Later, Merarites camp &#8220;on the north side of the tabernacle&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-35.htm">Numbers 3:35</a>) under the leadership of Zuriel. Their duties, described in <a href="/numbers/4-29.htm">Numbers 4:29-33</a>, involve carrying the heaviest tabernacle parts (boards, crossbars, pillars). This fits God&#8217;s pattern of assigning each Levite clan a specific load (cf. Kohath in <a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-15</a>; Gershon in <a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why the age of one month?</b><p>Counting &#8220;a month old or more&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-15.htm">Numbers 3:15, 34</a>) differs from the later work-service census at thirty to fifty years old (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>). Here God is establishing ownership, not work eligibility. From their first month of life these males belong to Him&#8212;echoing the dedication of every firstborn son (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>) and foreshadowing how Mary and Joseph present Jesus at forty days old (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Special calling of the Levites</b><p>The Levites replace the firstborn &#8220;so that there will be no plague among the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>). Their set-apart status safeguards the nation; only they may handle holy objects (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). <a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm">Hebrews 7:5</a> later notes that Levites even receive tithes&#8212;a role tied to their unique ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Significance of the number 6,200</b><p>&#8226; Demonstrates God&#8217;s detailed knowledge of His people (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Confirms that Merari, though numerically smallest in service-age men (cf. <a href="/numbers/4-34.htm">Numbers 4:34-37</a>), still matters in God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; Fits the overall tally so that the redemption math works: 22,273 firstborn Israelites (<a href="/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>) minus 22,000 Levites leaves 273 to be ransomed with five shekels each (<a href="/numbers/3-46.htm">Numbers 3:46-48</a>). Accuracy down to single persons and shekels underscores divine precision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Application for today</b><p>&#8226; If God knows the exact count of Merarite infants, He surely knows each of us (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Early dedication models how parents can consecrate children to the Lord&#8217;s service (<a href="/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Every believer has an assigned &#8220;load&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>); comparing totals (7,500 vs. 6,200) reminds us that prominence differs, but faithfulness is required of all (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-34.htm">Numbers 3:34</a> records 6,200 Merarite males a month old or more. The verse highlights God&#8217;s meticulous census, the early consecration of Levites, and the integral place of even the smallest clan in the tabernacle&#8217;s mission. By counting infants, the Lord affirms ownership from the start; by preserving exact numbers, He demonstrates sovereign order; and by assigning specific tasks, He teaches that every believer&#8212;regardless of size or visibility&#8212;belongs, is known, and has a role in His redemptive work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/3-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The number</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
