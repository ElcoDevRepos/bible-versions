The recruitment of a thousand men from each tribe suggests a sense of equality and shared responsibility among the tribes of Israel. This method of recruitment ensures that no single tribe bears the entire burden of warfare, reflecting the unity and collective effort of the nation. Historically, this approach underscores the importance of tribal identity and cohesion in ancient Israel. The number "thousand" often symbolizes completeness or a significant quantity in biblical terms, emphasizing the seriousness of the task at hand.<p><b>twelve thousand armed for war.</b><br>The total number of twelve thousand soldiers highlights the scale of the military campaign. In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, these men were assembled to execute God's judgment against the Midianites, who had led Israel into sin (Numbers 25). The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often representing divine government or authority, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles in the New Testament. This connection may suggest that the military action was under divine sanction and order. The phrase "armed for war" indicates that these men were prepared and equipped for battle, reflecting the seriousness of the conflict and the need for readiness in spiritual warfare, a theme echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received God's command to take vengeance on the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_tribes.htm">Israelite Tribes</a></b><br>The twelve tribes of Israel, each contributing a thousand men for the battle against Midian.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who were adversaries of Israel, leading them into idolatry and immorality.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The son of Eleazar the priest, who played a significant role in the battle, carrying holy articles and trumpets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle_against_midian.htm">The Battle Against Midian</a></b><br>A divinely commanded military campaign to execute judgment on the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_divine_commands.htm">Obedience to Divine Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' response to God's command through Moses demonstrates the importance of obedience in fulfilling God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The battle against Midian serves as a reminder of the serious consequences of leading others into sin, as seen in the Midianites' influence on Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to physical battle, Christians are called to spiritual warfare, armed with the armor of God (Ephesians 6).<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_cooperation.htm">Unity and Cooperation</a></b><br>The unified effort of the twelve tribes highlights the strength found in unity and cooperation among God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership.htm">Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Moses and Phinehas exemplify godly leadership, guiding the people in obedience to God's commands and ensuring the presence of God in their endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_31_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 31:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Obedience_in_Numbers_31_5.htm">How does Numbers 31:5 demonstrate obedience to God's commands in difficult situations?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leadership_lessons_from_tribal_selection.htm">What can we learn about leadership from the selection of "1,000 from each tribe"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_31_5_to_Eph_6_10-18.htm">How does Numbers 31:5 connect to spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6:10-18?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Numbers_31_5_unity_apply_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the concept of unity in Numbers 31:5 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_plan_in_Numbers_31_5.htm">How does Numbers 31:5 encourage us to trust God's plan in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_send_1_000_men_per_tribe_to_war.htm">Why did God command Moses to send 1,000 men from each tribe to war in Numbers 31:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Numbers_31_5_just_and_loving.htm">How does Numbers 31:5 align with the concept of a loving and just God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Numbers_31_5_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Numbers 31:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_differing_census_counts.htm">Numbers 3 - How do we reconcile these population figures with other biblical passages that present different census counts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_many_fighting_men_in_israel.htm">In that count how many fighting men were found in Israel?
