The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship, as the peace offering was shared among the priests, the offerer, and God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were commonly used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and abundance of the offering, as well as the offerer's desire to honor God with significant resources.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were also used in various offerings, including sin offerings. In this context, the male goats contribute to the peace offering, emphasizing the offerer's dedication and the desire for reconciliation and fellowship with God. The repetition of the number five reinforces the theme of grace and favor.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and ideal for sacrifice. They symbolize innocence and purity, often seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God. The use of five lambs further underscores the offerer's commitment to presenting a complete and gracious offering to God.<p><b>This was the offering of Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.</b><br>Gamaliel, a leader of the tribe of Manasseh, is noted for his role in the dedication of the altar. His offering is part of a larger narrative where each tribal leader presents offerings for the dedication of the tabernacle. This act of giving reflects the unity and collective worship of the Israelites. Gamaliel's lineage, being the son of Pedahzur, connects him to the heritage and promises given to the tribes of Israel, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the offerings from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are bringing offerings as part of the dedication of the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the offerings are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering that is completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_gad.htm">Tribe of Gad</a></b><br>The tribe making the offering on this particular day as part of the dedication ceremony.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/total_dedication_to_god.htm">Total Dedication to God</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes complete surrender to God.

Because part of the animal was eaten by the worshiper, it pictured communion between God and His people&#8212;an Old-Testament foreshadowing of the peace we now enjoy through Christ (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>). Gamaliel&#8217;s act declares, &#8220;Our tribe is at peace with the LORD, and we rejoice in His presence.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of two oxen</b><p>Oxen were the costliest animals an Israelite could present (<a href="/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a>). Strong and valuable, they underscored that approaching God is never cheap. Their inclusion reminds us that genuine fellowship with Him still calls for wholehearted, sacrificial devotion (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>five rams</b><p>Rams often marked moments of dedication (<a href="/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22</a>) and substitution (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>).

The number five, frequently linked with God&#8217;s gracious provision (e.g., <a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-21</a>), keeps the focus on divine generosity rather than human merit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>five male goats</b><p>Goats are usually connected with sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm">Leviticus 16:9-10</a>), reminding worshipers of their ongoing need for cleansing. Including them in a peace offering highlights that fellowship with a holy God rests on forgiveness already secured. In Christ this truth reaches its highest fulfillment (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>five male lambs a year old</b><p>Year-old lambs had to be without blemish (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>), emphasizing innocence and perfection&#8212;qualities perfectly embodied by &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).

Nothing is random; every item, every tribe, every day mattered to God (<a href="/numbers/7-11.htm">Numbers 7:11-88</a>). He still notices faithful obedience carried out in the pattern He prescribes (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Gamaliel son of Pedahzur</b><p>Gamaliel represented the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="/numbers/1-15.htm">Numbers 1:15</a>).

By following the same itinerary and proportions as the other tribes, Gamaliel affirms unity within diversity&#8212;each tribe distinct, yet all committed to one covenant LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-59.htm">Numbers 7:59</a> records Naphtali&#8217;s leader bringing a costly, carefully balanced peace offering.
