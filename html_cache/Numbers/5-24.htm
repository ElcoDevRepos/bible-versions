In ancient Israel, this was a test for a woman suspected of adultery. The priest would prepare a mixture of holy water and dust from the tabernacle floor, which the woman would drink. The "bitter water" symbolizes the potential consequences of sin and the seriousness with which God views marital fidelity. The concept of a curse in the Old Testament often involves divine judgment or consequences for disobedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This ritual underscores the importance of purity and faithfulness in marriage, reflecting God's covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>and it will enter her</b><br>The act of drinking the water signifies the internalization of the test. In biblical terms, what enters a person often symbolizes spiritual or moral influence, as seen in Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a> about what defiles a person. The physical act of drinking represents the spiritual reality of God's judgment entering the woman's life. This phrase highlights the belief that God is intimately involved in the lives of His people, discerning truth and administering justice.<p><b>and may cause her bitter suffering</b><br>The potential for "bitter suffering" serves as a deterrent against infidelity and a reminder of the consequences of sin. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal and familial harmony was paramount, and this ritual aimed to protect these values. The suffering mentioned here is both physical and social, as a guilty verdict would lead to shame and ostracism. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical theme of sin leading to suffering, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of humanity. The ordeal can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He takes upon Himself the curse and suffering due to sin, offering believers forgiveness and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In <a href="/numbers/5-24.htm">Numbers 5:24</a>, the priest plays a central role in administering the ritual of the bitter water.
