The Levites were tasked with various duties, including the care and transportation of the Tabernacle and its furnishings during the Israelites' wilderness journey. This division of labor highlights the importance of order and structure in worship, as well as the need for a dedicated group to support the priestly functions. The Levites' role is a precursor to the New Testament concept of the church body, where different members have different gifts and roles (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-31</a>).<p><b>but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar,</b><br>This restriction underscores the holiness of the sanctuary and the altar, which were central to Israel's worship and sacrificial system. Only the priests, descendants of Aaron, were permitted to handle these sacred objects, emphasizing the separation between the holy and the common. This separation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the need for purity and reverence in approaching God. The furnishings of the sanctuary, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, and the lampstand, were symbols of God's presence and covenant with Israel. This restriction foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who grants believers direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>or both they and you will die.</b><br>The severe consequence for violating this command highlights the seriousness of approaching God improperly. In the Old Testament, God's holiness is often associated with life and death, as seen in the accounts of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). This warning served as a deterrent to ensure that the sanctity of the worship space was maintained. It also points to the necessity of a mediator between God and humanity, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who through His sacrifice, allows believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest and brother of Moses, responsible for the sanctuary and its services.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart to assist the priests in the service of the tabernacle, but not allowed to perform priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place where God's presence dwelt, containing sacred furnishings and the altar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>A sacred structure used for sacrifices and offerings to God, central to Israelite worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the Israelites worshiped during their journey in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_roles_and_boundaries.htm">The Importance of Roles and Boundaries</a></b><br>God assigns specific roles and responsibilities within His community.
