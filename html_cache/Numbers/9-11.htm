The provision of a second Passover, known as Pesach Sheni, highlights God's grace and the importance of the Passover as a foundational event in Israel's history. The timing at twilight mirrors the original Passover in <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>, emphasizing continuity and the importance of precise obedience to God's commands. The second month, Iyar, provides a second chance for participation, reflecting God's desire for inclusivity in worship.<p><b>They are to eat the lamb,</b><br>The lamb is central to the Passover celebration, symbolizing the sacrifice that spared the Israelites from the plague of the firstborn in Egypt. This act of eating the lamb is a direct connection to the original Passover event, reinforcing the themes of deliverance and redemption. The lamb also serves as a type of Christ, the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), whose sacrifice brings ultimate deliverance from sin.<p><b>together with unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, or matzah, is a reminder of the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt, as there was no time for the dough to rise. It symbolizes purity and the removal of sin, as leaven often represents sin in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>). The inclusion of unleavened bread in the second Passover underscores the call to holiness and separation from sin.<p><b>and bitter herbs;</b><br>Bitter herbs, or maror, are eaten to recall the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. This element of the Passover meal serves as a tangible reminder of the suffering endured by the Israelites and the subsequent deliverance by God's mighty hand. The bitterness also points to the suffering of Christ, who bore the sins of the world, and the bitterness of sin from which believers are delivered.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now in the wilderness, receiving instructions on how to live as a covenant community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who receives and communicates God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>A significant event and feast commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt, marked by the sacrifice of a lamb and the eating of unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_month.htm">The Second Month</a></b><br>Refers to the month of Iyar in the Hebrew calendar, which is the time specified for those who were unable to observe the Passover in the first month (Nisan).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_all.htm">God's Provision for All</a></b><br>The allowance for a second Passover in the second month demonstrates God's grace and provision for those who, due to circumstances beyond their control, could not participate in the first observance.
