The Israelites, under God's command, engaged in battle as they journeyed toward the Promised Land. This victory is significant as it demonstrates God's faithfulness in delivering His people and fulfilling His promises. The phrase "put him to the sword" indicates a complete and decisive victory, which was common in ancient warfare narratives. This event is a fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of the Amorites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-36</a>).<p><b>and took possession of his land</b><br>The Israelites' taking possession of the land signifies the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This act of taking possession is not just a military conquest but also a divine mandate, as the land was part of the inheritance promised to the descendants of Abraham. The possession of the land also symbolizes God's provision and the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>from the Arnon to the Jabbok</b><br>The Arnon and the Jabbok are rivers that define the geographical boundaries of the land taken from Sihon. The Arnon River marked the southern boundary, while the Jabbok River marked the northern boundary. This territory was strategically important, providing control over key trade routes and fertile land. The mention of these rivers highlights the specific fulfillment of God's promise and the tangible nature of the Israelites' inheritance.<p><b>but only up to the border of the Ammonites</b><br>The Israelites respected the border of the Ammonites, as God had instructed them not to harass or provoke the Ammonites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). This respect for boundaries demonstrates Israel's obedience to God's commands and the recognition of God's sovereignty over the nations. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and thus had a distinct relationship with Israel.<p><b>because it was fortified</b><br>The fortification of the Ammonite border indicates the presence of strong defenses, which were common in ancient Near Eastern cities. These fortifications served as protection against invasions and were a testament to the military and political strength of the Ammonites. The Israelites' decision not to engage with the Ammonites reflects a strategic choice to avoid unnecessary conflict and adhere to God's specific instructions regarding their conquests.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Jacob, who are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The Amorite king who opposed Israel and was defeated by them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon.htm">Arnon</a></b><br>A river that served as a boundary marker, representing the southern border of the land taken by Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabbok.htm">Jabbok</a></b><br>Another river marking the northern extent of the land Israel captured from Sihon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring people whose border was respected by Israel due to its fortification and possibly divine instruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battles.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battles</a></b><br>This passage illustrates God's control over the outcomes of battles.

It was, therefore, a critical moment in their history when they met the forces of Sihon, confident from their recent victory over Moab. We may suppose that Joshua was their military leader now, as before and after. From Arnon unto Jabbok. The Jabbok, which formed the boundary of Sihon on the north towards the kingdom of Og, and on the east towards the Ammonites, is the modern Zerka: it runs in a large curve northeast, north-west, and west, until it fails into Jordan, forty-five miles north of the mouth of the Arnon. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> This is perhaps intended to explain rather why the Amorites had not extended their conquests any further, than why the Israelites made no attempt to cross the border of Ammon; they had another and more sufficient reason (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Rabbah of Ammon, which stood upon the right (here the eastern) bank of the Upper Jabbok, was an extremely strong place which effectually protected the country behind it, even until the reign of David (see on 2 Samuel 11, 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/21-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">put him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yak&#183;k&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
