The spoils were divided into two parts: one for the warriors and one for the rest of the community. This division reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where the benefits of victory were shared among all, not just those who fought. This practice underscores the principle of collective responsibility and blessing within the covenant community.<p><b>which Moses had set apart</b><br>Moses, as the leader and mediator of God's covenant, was responsible for ensuring that the division of spoils was conducted according to divine instructions. This act of setting apart indicates a sanctification process, where certain portions were designated for specific purposes, such as offerings to the Lord. It highlights Moses' role in maintaining order and obedience to God's commands, ensuring that the community remained faithful to the covenant.<p><b>from the men who had gone to war</b><br>The men who participated in the battle were entitled to a share of the spoils, recognizing their role and sacrifice in achieving victory. This allocation acknowledges the importance of those who actively engage in the defense and expansion of the community. It also reflects the biblical principle of rewarding labor and effort, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, which states, "The worker deserves his wages." This phrase emphasizes the fairness and justice inherent in God's laws for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
