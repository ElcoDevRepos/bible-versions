Moses is often approached by the people for guidance and clarification on the laws given by God. This reflects the hierarchical structure of leadership established by God, where Moses acts as the intermediary.<p><b>&#8220;We are unclean because of a dead body,</b><br>In the Israelite community, contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>. This uncleanness was not a moral failing but a ritual state that required purification. The concern for purity underscores the holiness required to approach God, emphasizing the separation between life and death, purity and impurity.<p><b>but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD&#8217;s offering</b><br>The offering referred to is likely the Passover sacrifice, a critical observance for the Israelites commemorating their deliverance from Egypt. The question posed reflects a desire to participate in communal worship and fulfill religious obligations, highlighting the importance of inclusion in the covenant community and the collective memory of God's salvation.<p><b>with the other Israelites</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of worship and the shared identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people. Being part of the community was essential for maintaining one's identity and relationship with God. It also reflects the unity and collective responsibility of the Israelites in observing God's commands.<p><b>at the appointed time?&#8221;</b><br>The appointed time refers to the specific timing of the Passover, which was a divinely ordained festival. Observing it at the correct time was crucial, as it was a remembrance of God's deliverance and a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice.
