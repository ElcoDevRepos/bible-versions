Their deaths are recorded in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD. This event underscores the seriousness of approaching God with reverence and obedience. Their deaths serve as a warning about the consequences of disobedience and the holiness required in worship. The incident highlights the importance of following God's commands precisely, as deviation can lead to severe consequences.<p><b>when they offered unauthorized fire</b><br>The "unauthorized fire" refers to an offering that was not commanded by God. In the context of the Levitical priesthood, specific instructions were given for offerings and sacrifices. Nadab and Abihu's actions were a direct violation of these instructions, demonstrating a lack of respect for God's holiness and authority. This act of presumption is often seen as a symbol of human attempts to approach God on their own terms, rather than His. The incident emphasizes the need for adherence to divine instructions in worship practices.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the presence of God, particularly in the tabernacle, where His glory dwelt among the Israelites. This setting underscores the gravity of Nadab and Abihu's actions, as they were performed in the direct presence of God. The tabernacle was a sacred space, and any act of disobedience there was especially egregious. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's omnipresence and the need for holiness in His presence, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New Testament teachings on the holiness of God and the reverence due to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab_and_abihu.htm">Nadab and Abihu</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel.
