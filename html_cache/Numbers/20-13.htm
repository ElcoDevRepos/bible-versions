This location is significant in Israel's wilderness journey, marking a moment of testing and divine intervention. Meribah is also mentioned in <a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>, where a similar incident occurs, highlighting a pattern of doubt and rebellion among the Israelites. The site is traditionally identified with a location near Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, though exact archaeological evidence is sparse.<p><b>where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD</b><br>The Israelites' quarrel with the LORD at Meribah reflects a recurring theme of unbelief and rebellion during their wilderness wanderings. This incident underscores the tension between God's provision and the people's lack of faith. The Israelites' complaints about water reveal their persistent struggle to trust in God's promises, despite witnessing numerous miracles. This event is a reminder of the human tendency to doubt in times of need, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the grumbling in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>.<p><b>and He showed His holiness among them</b><br>God's response to the Israelites' quarrel at Meribah demonstrates His holiness and justice. By instructing Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water, God intended to display His power and sanctity. However, Moses' disobedience in striking the rock instead of speaking to it (<a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11-12</a>) resulted in a failure to uphold God's holiness. This incident emphasizes the importance of obedience and reverence for God's commands. It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's holiness through Jesus Christ, who is described as the "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, offering spiritual sustenance to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was instructed by God to speak to the rock to bring forth water but instead struck it, leading to significant consequences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, who was with Moses during this event and also faced consequences for the actions taken at Meribah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying through the wilderness and quarreled with Moses and Aaron due to a lack of water.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/meribah.htm">Meribah</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites quarreled with God, meaning "quarreling" or "strife" in Hebrew, highlighting the contentious nature of the event.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who demonstrated His holiness and authority through the miraculous provision of water, despite the disobedience of Moses and Aaron.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's response at Meribah underscores His holiness and the importance of reverence and obedience.

Israel had already experienced a Meribah at Rephidim decades earlier (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>), yet the new generation repeats the old complaint.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s provision of water from the rock underscores His covenant faithfulness in spite of repeated unbelief, echoing <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8-9</a>, which pleads, &#8220;Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By identifying the location so clearly, Scripture teaches that physical places can become spiritual memorials&#8212;either of trust (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>) or of testing (<a href="/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32-33</a>). Meribah belongs to the latter category, warning every future reader.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s dispute was not merely with Moses; verse 3 records them saying, &#8220;If only we had perished when our brothers fell before the LORD!&#8221; Their grievance is ultimately vertical.<p>&#8226; Complaining reveals a heart that questions God&#8217;s goodness. Paul later cites this very episode to admonish believers: &#8220;Do not grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The quarrel exposes a cycle of unbelief: hardship &#8594; complaint &#8594; forgetfulness of past deliverance (<a href="/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses himself, provoked by the people, strikes the rock twice instead of speaking to it as commanded (<a href="/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8-11</a>). In that moment leader and nation alike fail to revere God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He showed His holiness among them</b><p>&#8226; God still brings forth abundant water, proving mercy, yet He immediately announces judgment: &#8220;Because you did not trust Me to demonstrate My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Holiness means God cannot overlook unbelief, even in His chosen servants. <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a> laid down the principle: &#8220;Among those who approach Me I will be proved holy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The tension of mercy and judgment reveals God&#8217;s character. He supplies life-giving water (a picture fulfilled in Christ, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>) while upholding moral purity.<p>&#8226; Later Scripture revisits this moment: <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a> links Moses&#8217; exclusion from Canaan directly to failing to &#8220;treat Me as holy,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/99-8.htm">Psalm 99:8</a> balances forgiveness with retribution. God&#8217;s holiness is consistent from Genesis to Revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>At Meribah, God turned a place of desperate need into a stage for His glory. The nation&#8217;s quarrel exposed unbelief; Moses&#8217; rash action added disobedience; yet God&#8217;s response&#8212;water for the thirsty and discipline for the faithless&#8212;displayed unblemished holiness. Meribah therefore stands as both a warning against grumbling and a testimony that the Holy One remains faithful, merciful, and absolutely just.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">This is the water</span> <span class= "bld">of Meribah.--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of strife.

If the place derived its name, Kadesh, from these circumstances, it must have been called by that name proleptically in <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>--a supposition which is entirely consistent with the manner in which the place is mentioned in that verse ("<span class= "ital">Enmishpat, </span>which is Kadesh.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the water of Meribah,</span> or "water of strife."

A similar use of the word is recorded in <a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>.
