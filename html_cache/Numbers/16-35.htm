In the context of <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, this event occurs during the rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses and Aaron. The fire symbolizes God's holiness and His intolerance of sin and rebellion. Similar divine fire appears in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where Nadab and Abihu are consumed for offering unauthorized fire. This demonstrates God's consistent standard of holiness and the seriousness of approaching Him improperly.<p><b>and consumed the 250 men</b><br>The consumption of the 250 men highlights the severity of their rebellion. These men were leaders within the community, chosen representatives who sided with Korah against God's appointed leaders. Their destruction serves as a warning against challenging God's established order. The use of fire as a consuming force is a recurring biblical theme, representing God's purifying and judgmental power, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>.<p><b>who were offering the incense</b><br>Offering incense was a priestly duty, reserved for those whom God had specifically appointed. The 250 men, by offering incense, were attempting to usurp the priestly role given to Aaron and his descendants. This act of presumption parallels the sin of Uzziah in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>, where he is struck with leprosy for unlawfully burning incense. The incense offering symbolizes prayer and worship (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>), and unauthorized offerings represent false worship and self-exaltation against God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who demonstrates His holiness and justice through divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/2/250_men.htm">250 Men</a></b><br>These were leaders of the community who joined Korah in his rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their God-given authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah's_rebellion.htm">Korah's Rebellion</a></b><br>A significant event where Korah, along with Dathan, Abiram, and others, led a revolt against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the incense was offered and where God's presence dwelt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire_from_the_lord.htm">Fire from the LORD</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's judgment, consuming those who acted in disobedience and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's holiness demands reverence and obedience.

The verse opens with a tiny conjunction that ties us back to the flow of Korah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Nothing here is random or isolated; the &#8220;and&#8221; shows that divine judgment follows immediately after the ground swallowed Korah&#8217;s households (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links sin to consequence&#8212;think of <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>-12 where Achan&#8217;s hidden sin led to Israel&#8217;s defeat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fire came forth</b><p>&#8226;

Other times God sent fire include Elijah calling it down on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) and on the soldiers sent by King Ahaziah (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226;
