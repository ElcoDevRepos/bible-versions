The land in question is Edom, located south of the Dead Sea. The Edomites are descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, making them relatives of the Israelites. This familial connection is significant, as it underscores the expectation of hospitality and cooperation. The request reflects a diplomatic approach, seeking peaceful passage rather than conflict. Historically, such requests were common in the ancient Near East, where travel often required permission from local rulers.<p><b>We will not go through any field or vineyard,</b><br>The Israelites assure the Edomites that their passage will not disrupt local agriculture. Fields and vineyards were vital to the economy and sustenance of the region, and trampling them could lead to significant loss. This promise indicates respect for Edomite property and resources, emphasizing the Israelites' intention to avoid any form of exploitation or harm. The mention of fields and vineyards also highlights the agricultural richness of Edom, contrasting with the Israelites' current wilderness experience.<p><b>or drink water from any well.</b><br>Water was a precious resource in the arid regions of the Near East. Wells were often privately owned and essential for survival. By promising not to drink from any wells, the Israelites demonstrate an understanding of the scarcity and value of water. This assurance further emphasizes their intention to pass through without imposing on Edomite resources. The scarcity of water in the wilderness journey of the Israelites is a recurring theme, highlighting their dependence on God's provision.<p><b>We will stay on the King&#8217;s Highway;</b><br>The King's Highway was an ancient trade route running from Egypt through the Sinai Peninsula to the northern regions of the Near East. It was a well-established path used for commerce and travel, providing a direct route through Edom. By committing to stay on this highway, the Israelites indicate their desire to take the most efficient and least intrusive path. The King's Highway's historical significance as a major trade route underscores the strategic importance of Edom's location.<p><b>we will not turn to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase signifies the Israelites' commitment to a straightforward journey without deviation. It implies a promise of discipline and respect for Edomite boundaries, avoiding any unnecessary detours that might lead to conflict or trespass. Biblically, the concept of not turning to the right or left is often associated with obedience and faithfulness to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>.<p><b>until we have passed through your territory.</b><br>The Israelites' goal is to pass through Edom peacefully and efficiently, without lingering or causing disruption. This reflects their broader mission to reach the Promised Land, a journey guided by divine promise and direction. The emphasis on passing through highlights the transient nature of their request, seeking only temporary access rather than permanent settlement. This passage through Edom is part of the larger narrative of the Israelites' wilderness journey, marked by challenges and reliance on God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is making the request to pass through Edom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>The land inhabited by the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and the territory the Israelites wish to pass through.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king's_highway.htm">King's Highway</a></b><br>An ancient trade route that the Israelites propose to use for their journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The people of Edom, who are being asked for permission to allow the Israelites to pass through their land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_others'_boundaries.htm">Respect for Others' Boundaries</a></b><br>The Israelites' request to pass through Edom without disturbing the land teaches us the importance of respecting others' property and boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_negotiation.htm">Peaceful Negotiation</a></b><br>The approach of asking permission rather than assuming rights emphasizes the value of peaceful negotiation and diplomacy in resolving potential conflicts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Despite the refusal from Edom, the Israelites had to trust in God's provision and guidance, reminding us to rely on God when faced with obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context_and_relationships.htm">Historical Context and Relationships</a></b><br>Understanding the historical context between Israel and Edom can help us appreciate the complexities of relationships and the importance of reconciliation and peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_the_journey.htm">Faithfulness in the Journey</a></b><br>The commitment to stay on the King's Highway symbolizes faithfulness and determination in following God's path without deviation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_20_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 20:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_20_17_Permission_respect.htm">How does Numbers 20:17 illustrate the importance of seeking permission and respect?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_guidance_in_Num_20_17.htm">What can we learn about God's guidance from Israel's request in Numbers 20:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_20_17_to_Jesus_love_teaching.htm">How does Numbers 20:17 connect with Jesus' teaching on loving neighbors?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Numbers_20_17_s_peace_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of peaceful negotiation from Numbers 20:17 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_20_17_Trust_God_s_plan_in_trials.htm">What does Numbers 20:17 teach about trusting God's plan in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Israel_seek_Edom_passage.htm">Why did Israel request passage through Edom in Numbers 20:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_20_17_Israel-Edom_relationship.htm">What does Numbers 20:17 reveal about Israel's relationship with Edom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_20_17_show_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Numbers 20:17 reflect God's guidance for Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_archaeology_confirm_mt._seir's_ruin.htm">In Ezekiel 35:3&#8211;4, can archaeological evidence confirm the eternal desolation of Mount Seir as prophesied?
