Raising his hand signifies an authoritative action, often associated with invoking divine power or judgment. This gesture is reminiscent of Moses raising his staff over the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>), symbolizing God's power working through him.<p><b>and struck the rock twice with his staff</b><br>The staff of Moses is a symbol of God's authority and power. Striking the rock twice indicates a deviation from God's command to simply speak to the rock (<a href="/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8</a>). This act of disobedience reflects a moment of human weakness and lack of faith, which ultimately led to Moses being denied entry into the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). The rock is often seen as a type of Christ, as Paul notes in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where Christ is the spiritual rock providing sustenance.<p><b>so that a great amount of water gushed out</b><br>The miraculous provision of water in the desert underscores God's mercy and provision for His people despite their complaints and Moses' disobedience. This event is a reminder of God's ability to provide abundantly, even in seemingly impossible situations. It also parallels the provision of manna, highlighting God's continuous care for Israel.<p><b>and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink</b><br>The provision of water not only for the people but also for their livestock emphasizes the completeness of God's provision. It reflects the pastoral care God has for His creation, ensuring that all needs are met.
