Manasseh, along with his brother Ephraim, received a blessing from their grandfather Jacob, who adopted them as his own sons (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>). This adoption effectively gave Joseph a double portion among the tribes of Israel. The tribe of Manasseh was unique in that it was divided into two half-tribes, with one half settling east of the Jordan River and the other half settling west. This division is significant in understanding the geographical and political landscape of ancient Israel. The tribe's location on both sides of the Jordan River made it strategically important and often involved in conflicts with neighboring peoples. The census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> was conducted to organize the Israelites for military purposes, and the registration of the tribe of Manasseh reflects their role in the collective defense and conquest of the Promised Land.<p><b>numbered 32,200</b><br>The census number of 32,200 men of fighting age (20 years and older) from the tribe of Manasseh indicates the tribe's military potential at the time of the wilderness wanderings. This figure is part of the larger census that counted the total number of Israelite men able to go to war, which was 603,550 (<a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>). The number reflects the tribe's size and strength relative to other tribes. Historically, the tribe of Manasseh was not one of the largest tribes, and its numbers here are smaller compared to tribes like Judah or Ephraim. This census was crucial for organizing the Israelites as they prepared to enter the Promised Land, highlighting the importance of each tribe's contribution to the collective mission. The specific number also underscores the meticulous nature of the record-keeping and organization within the Israelite community, as commanded by God through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph.
