This event is the culmination of the ten plagues that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery. The death of the firstborn was a direct and devastating blow to Egyptian families, affecting every household. This plague is recorded in <a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-30</a>, where it states that there was not a house without someone dead. The firstborn held a place of prominence in ancient cultures, often inheriting leadership and a double portion of the family estate, making this loss particularly significant.<p><b>whom the LORD had struck down among them</b><br>This indicates that the deaths of the firstborn were an act of divine intervention. The LORD's direct involvement underscores His sovereignty and power over life and death. It also highlights the fulfillment of His promise to deliver His people from bondage. This act of judgment was not random but a deliberate response to Pharaoh's hardened heart and refusal to let the Israelites go, as seen in <a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4-7</a>. The LORD's actions demonstrate His justice and the seriousness of opposing His will.<p><b>for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods</b><br>This phrase reveals the spiritual dimension of the plagues, particularly the death of the firstborn. Each plague was a direct challenge to the pantheon of Egyptian deities, demonstrating the LORD's supremacy over them. The Egyptians worshiped many gods, including those associated with fertility, life, and protection. The death of the firstborn was a direct affront to these deities, showing their impotence in the face of the true God. This judgment against the gods of Egypt is echoed in <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, where God declares He will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. This act foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all false gods and points to the future triumph of Christ, who disarms the spiritual powers and authorities, as described in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt who were experiencing the aftermath of the tenth plague, the death of the firstborn.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstborn.htm">Firstborn</a></b><br>Refers to the firstborn sons of the Egyptians, who were struck down as part of God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who executed judgment against the Egyptians and their gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_against_the_gods_of_egypt.htm">Judgment against the gods of Egypt</a></b><br>This event signifies God's power over the Egyptian deities, demonstrating His supremacy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The event underscores God's absolute authority over all creation, including false gods and idols.

The fact that the Egyptians were so universally employed about the funeral rites of their first-born - rites to which they paid such extreme attention - seems to be mentioned here as supplying one reason at least why the Israelites began their outward march without opposition. It is in perfect accordance with what we know of the Egyptians, that all other passions and interests should give place for the time to the necessary care for the departed. <span class="cmt_word">Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.</span> See on Exodus 12:12, and cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.
