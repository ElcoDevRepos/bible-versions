These commandments and ordinances are part of the Mosaic Law, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. They were intended to guide the Israelites in their covenant relationship with God and to set them apart as His chosen people. The commandments reflect God's holiness and justice, and they foreshadow the coming of Christ, who would fulfill the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>that the LORD gave the Israelites</b><br>The LORD, Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. The giving of the law to the Israelites signifies God's direct communication and covenant relationship with them. This divine revelation was unique to Israel, highlighting their role as a nation chosen to be a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses is the central human figure in the Pentateuch, serving as the mediator between God and the Israelites. He is a type of Christ, as both are deliverers and lawgivers. Moses' role as a prophet and leader is foundational to Israel's identity and history. His faithfulness in delivering God's commandments is a model of obedience and leadership (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>).<p><b>on the plains of Moab</b><br>The plains of Moab are located east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho. This geographical setting is significant as it represents the final staging area before the Israelites enter the Promised Land. The plains of Moab are also where Moses delivered his final speeches, which are recorded in the book of Deuteronomy. This location underscores the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a critical geographical marker in Israel's history. It represents a boundary and a crossing point into the Promised Land. The crossing of the Jordan by the Israelites, led by Joshua, is a pivotal moment of faith and fulfillment of God's promises (Joshua 3-4). The Jordan also holds future significance in the New Testament, as the site of Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<p><b>across from Jericho</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and the first city conquered by the Israelites in the Promised Land (Joshua 6). Its location across from the plains of Moab highlights the imminent fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham. The fall of Jericho is a testament to God's power and faithfulness, as well as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory over sin and death through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are receiving the commandments and ordinances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, through whom God delivered the law and guidance to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provides the commandments and ordinances.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are encamped, east of the Jordan River, as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river_and_jericho.htm">Jordan River and Jericho</a></b><br>Geographical markers indicating the proximity to the Promised Land, with Jericho being the first city they will encounter upon crossing the Jordan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The commandments and ordinances given by God are not mere suggestions but are essential for living a life that honors Him.

Like the earlier summary in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>, this phrase gathers up forty years of statutes (compare <a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1&#8211;17</a> for the foundational commands and <a href="/bsb/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a> for ordinance-filled worship schedules). The plural &#8220;commandments and ordinances&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s care for every facet of life&#8212;worship, justice, purity, inheritance&#8212;so His people can live distinctly in the land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD gave</b><p>The commands come from the personal, covenant-keeping LORD, not from human brainstorming. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a> shows Him writing with His own finger; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a> later affirms that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221; Because He is holy (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>) and faithful (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>), what He gives is flawless, trustworthy, and non-negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Israelites</b><p>The immediate recipients are the covenant community descended from Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). <a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19&#8211;20</a> notes the privilege: &#8220;He declares His word to Jacob&#8230; He has done this for no other nation.&#8221; Yet through Israel the world would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), a theme Paul unfolds in <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>. The verse reminds us that identity with God&#8217;s people carries both privilege and responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through Moses</b><p>Moses stands as mediator, faithfully passing along exactly what he receives (<a href="/exodus/34-27.htm">Exodus 34:27</a>). <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a> praises him as &#8220;faithful as a servant in all God&#8217;s house.&#8221; <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a> later contrasts law through Moses with grace through Christ, but never diminishes Moses&#8217; God-appointed role. His obedience underscores that spiritual leadership is stewardship, not innovation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the plains of Moab</b><p>The setting matters. <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a> first placed Israel here, poised just east of Canaan. Decades of wandering are over; obedience now stands between them and promise-fulfillment. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a> will begin a series of farewell sermons in this same location, so this geographical note anchors both continuity and urgency: the law is reviewed right where choices must be made (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the Jordan</b><p>The river represents a boundary between wilderness and inheritance. <a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1&#8211;17</a> will record the miraculous crossing; here, the law is reiterated so that when the people step over, they do so under divine authority. <a href="/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a> uses poetic memory of Jordan&#8217;s retreat to remind subsequent generations that creation itself yields to God&#8217;s covenant plans.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>across from Jericho</b><p>Jericho, the first fortified city in Canaan (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>), looms in view. Mentioning it roots the verse in physical reality and underlines imminent conquest. The sight of Jericho would have stirred both excitement and sober reflection: victory depends on obeying the very commandments just summarized (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7&#8211;8</a>). Disobedience, as later seen at Ai (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>), would bring setback.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/36-13.htm">Numbers 36:13</a> is more than a literary sign-off; it is a seven-fold reminder that the law is comprehensive, divine, covenant-focused, mediated, timely, place-specific, and conquest-oriented. God speaks clear directives, through His chosen servant, to His redeemed people, at the threshold of promise. Their future&#8212;and ours as we trust the same faithful Lord&#8212;hinges on hearing and doing what He has given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The commandments,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This is one of the words which recur so continually in Deuteronomy and in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. It is found four times in chapter 15, and in a few other passages of the earlier books, including <a href="/leviticus/27-34.htm">Leviticus 27:34</a>. The judgments. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. A similar formula is found at the conclusion of Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>), where, however, "the commandments" represents a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), and a third term, "the laws" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>), is added. It is difficult to say confidently what is included under the "these" of this verse. Comparing it with <a href="/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50</a>, it would seem that it only referred to the final regulations and enactments of the last four chapters; but as we have no reason to believe that the later sections of the Book are arranged in any methodical order, we cannot limit <span class="accented">its</span> scope to those, or deny that it may include the laws of chapters 28-30. For a similar reason we cannot say that the use of this concluding formula excludes the possibility of further large additions having been subsequently made to the Divine legislation in the same place and by the same person, as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy. All we can say is, that the Book of Numbers knows nothing about any such additions, and concludes in such sort as to make it a matter of surprise that such additions are afterwards met with. The continuity, which so clearly binds together the main bulk of the four books of Moses, ends with this verse.
