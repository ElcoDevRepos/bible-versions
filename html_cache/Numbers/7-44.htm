Gold was a common material used in the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, symbolizing the preciousness and holiness of the offerings made to God. The use of gold in the dish reflects the value and importance of the offering. In biblical times, gold was a rare and valuable commodity, often associated with royalty and divine worship, as seen in the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p><b>weighing ten shekels</b><br>The shekel was a standard unit of weight in ancient Israel, approximately 11.4 grams per shekel. The specific weight of ten shekels indicates a precise and intentional offering, reflecting the order and structure God required in worship. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in the Bible, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>).<p><b>filled with incense</b><br>Incense in the Bible is often associated with prayer and worship, symbolizing the prayers of the saints rising to God (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). The use of incense in the Tabernacle was a key part of the sacrificial system, representing a pleasing aroma to the Lord (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). Incense was made from a specific blend of spices, and its use was restricted to the worship of God, highlighting the sacredness of the offering.
