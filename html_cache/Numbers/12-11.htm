This reflects the hierarchical structure within the Israelite community, where Moses is recognized as the leader and mediator between God and the people. Aaron's approach to Moses highlights the respect and authority Moses holds, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. This moment occurs after Miriam and Aaron have spoken against Moses, questioning his unique relationship with God (<a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12:1-2</a>). The appeal to Moses underscores the need for intercession, a role Moses frequently fulfills, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>My lord</b><br>Aaron addresses Moses with a term of respect, acknowledging his leadership and authority. This title, "my lord," is used in various contexts in the Old Testament to show deference and submission (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8</a>). It indicates Aaron's recognition of Moses' God-given position and his own need for mercy. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where titles were significant in expressing social and spiritual hierarchies.<p><b>please do not hold against us</b><br>Aaron pleads for forgiveness, recognizing the gravity of their actions. This phrase indicates a request for pardon and the removal of guilt. In the broader biblical narrative, the concept of not holding sin against someone is central to the understanding of divine forgiveness (<a href="/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32:1-2</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). It reflects the need for repentance and the hope for restoration, themes that are consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>this sin</b><br>The specific sin referred to is the speaking against Moses due to jealousy and pride (<a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12:1-2</a>). Sin, in biblical terms, is a transgression against God's law and order. The acknowledgment of sin is crucial for reconciliation with God, as seen in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament and ultimately fulfilled in Christ's atoning work (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>we have so foolishly committed</b><br>Aaron admits the foolishness of their actions, which is a recognition of acting without wisdom or understanding. In biblical literature, foolishness is often contrasted with wisdom, which is rooted in the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This confession is an important step in the process of repentance, acknowledging the lack of discernment and the need for divine guidance. The humility in admitting foolishness is a precursor to receiving God's grace and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and Miriam, and the first high priest of Israel.
