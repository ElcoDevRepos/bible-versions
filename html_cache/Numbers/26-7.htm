The tribe of Reuben settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in the region that is now part of modern-day Jordan. This location was significant as it was outside the main territory of Israel, which sometimes led to tensions with other tribes. The Reubenites were known for their pastoral lifestyle, taking advantage of the fertile lands for grazing. The mention of "clans" indicates the division of the tribe into family groups, which was a common practice for organizing the people of Israel. This structure helped maintain order and manage resources effectively.<p><b>and their registration numbered 43,730</b><br>The census of the Israelites was commanded by God to Moses and Eleazar after the plague as recorded in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>. This census was crucial for determining the military strength of each tribe and for the allocation of land in the Promised Land. The number 43,730 represents the men of fighting age within the tribe of Reuben, indicating a decrease from the previous census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, where they numbered 46,500. This decrease could be attributed to the consequences of the rebellion led by Dathan and Abiram, who were from the tribe of Reuben, as well as the general hardships faced during the wilderness journey. The census underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God, as the numbers reflect the tribe's spiritual and physical condition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, Reuben is the patriarch of the tribe mentioned in this verse.
