In the context of the tabernacle, silver often symbolizes redemption and purity. The weight of 130 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel, indicates a standardized measure, ensuring fairness and consistency in offerings. This offering is part of the dedication of the altar, where each tribal leader presents gifts, emphasizing unity and shared responsibility among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, is a symbol of wealth and devotion. Weighing seventy shekels, it complements the platter, together forming a complete offering. The use of silver in both items underscores the importance of the offering and the reverence due to God. The bowl's purpose, likely for holding the grain offering, highlights the practical aspects of worship and the need for tangible expressions of faith.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a specific weight standard used in the tabernacle, ensuring that all offerings were measured equally.

Fine flour signifies purity and quality, while oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit and anointing.
