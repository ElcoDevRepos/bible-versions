Aaron, the first high priest, is about to pass his duties to his son Eleazar. This transfer of priestly authority is crucial for maintaining the continuity of worship and religious leadership among the Israelites. Aaron's role as high priest is foundational, as he was appointed by God to serve as a mediator between God and the people (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). Eleazar's succession signifies the importance of lineage and the hereditary nature of the priesthood, which is a theme seen throughout the Old Testament. This transition also prefigures the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is described as a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>).<p><b>and bring them up Mount Hor</b><br>Mount Hor is a significant geographical location in the biblical narrative. It is situated on the border of Edom, and its exact location is debated, though it is traditionally identified with Jebel Harun near Petra in modern-day Jordan. The ascent of Mount Hor symbolizes a journey of obedience and transition. It is on this mountain that Aaron will die, marking the end of an era for the Israelites. The mountain setting is often used in the Bible as a place of divine encounter and revelation, such as Mount Sinai for the giving of the Law (Exodus 19). The ascent also reflects the biblical theme of going up to meet God, as mountains are frequently depicted as places where heaven and earth meet. This event foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice and ascension of Jesus Christ, who, like Aaron, serves as a mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a key figure in the Exodus account.

God commands Moses to take Aaron&#8212;the outgoing high priest&#8212;and Eleazar&#8212;the incoming one&#8212;up Mount Hor. The phrase highlights (1) God&#8217;s justice toward sin, even in His greatest servants; (2) the seamless transfer of covenant responsibilities; (3) the necessity of public obedience; and (4) the historical reality of God&#8217;s dealings with His people. The verse reassures believers that while human leaders pass, the Lord faithfully provides new servants to carry on His holy work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bring them up unto Mount Hor.</span> It can scarcely be doubted that the object of this command was to produce a deeper effect upon the people. The whole multitude would be able to see the high priest, whose form had been so familiar to them as long as they could remember anything, slowly ascending the bare sides of the mountain; and they knew that he went up to die. The whole multitude would be able to see another and a younger man descending by the same path in the same priestly robes, and they knew that Aaron was dead, and that Eleazar was high priest in his room. Death is often most striking when least expected, but there are occasions (and this was one) when it gains in effect by being invested in a certain simple ceremonial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1434;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
