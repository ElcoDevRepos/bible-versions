Balak's repeated attempts to have Israel cursed highlight his fear and desperation due to Israel's growing power and presence. This reflects the broader biblical theme of opposition to God's chosen people.<p><b>&#8220;Please come with me to another place</b><br>Balak's strategy involves changing locations, hoping a different vantage point might influence Balaam's ability to curse Israel. This reflects ancient beliefs in the power of place and ritual in divination practices. It also underscores Balak's misunderstanding of the true source of Balaam's prophetic words, which is God, not the location.<p><b>where you can see them.</b><br>Balak desires Balaam to have a visual of the Israelites, believing that seeing them might aid in cursing them. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice where sight and presence were thought to enhance the effectiveness of a curse or blessing.<p><b>You will only see the outskirts of their camp&#8212;not all of them.</b><br>Balak's plan is to limit Balaam's view to only a portion of the Israelite camp. This could suggest a tactical move to make the Israelites appear less formidable or to focus the curse on a specific part of the camp. It also highlights the vastness of the Israelite encampment, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham about his descendants being numerous.<p><b>And from there, curse them for me.&#8221;</b><br>Balak's insistence on cursing Israel reveals his ignorance of God's covenant with Israel, which includes blessings and protection. This request is ultimately futile, as God's will cannot be thwarted by human schemes. The narrative foreshadows the ultimate blessing that Balaam will pronounce, which aligns with God's promises to Israel. This also prefigures the New Testament understanding of Christ, who turns curses into blessings for those who are in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, representing opposition to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whom Balak fears due to their numbers and victories.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cursing.htm">Cursing</a></b><br>The act Balak desires Balaam to perform against the Israelites, reflecting a spiritual battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human intentions, God's will prevails.

On the other hand, if that interpretation of <a href="/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a> be adopted, which implies that from Bamoth-Baal Balaam had a view of the whole of the host of Israel from one extremity of their camps to the other, the meaning of this verse would be that although the sight of so vast and orderly a mass produced so powerful an effect upon Balaam that he was unable to utter the curses which he had desired to pronounce upon Israel, such an effect would not be equally likely to be produced if only a portion of the camps was visible at the same time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come... unto another place.</span> Balak attributed the miscarriage of his enterprise thus far to something inauspicious in the locality.

Both the meaning of the nouns and the tense of the verb are disputed. By some <span class="accented">"e ephes katsehu"</span> (the end of the last of them) is held equivalent to "the whole of them," which seems to contradict the next clause even if defensible in itself. The ordinary rendering is favoured by the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and by the Targums. On the other hand, some would read the verb in the present tense, and understand Balak's words to refer to the place they were leaving. This is in accordance with the statement in <a href="/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, and it would certainly seem as if Balak and Balaam moved each time nearer to that encampment which was for different masons the center of attraction to them both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/23-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Balak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;l&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1111.htm">Strong's 1111: </a> </span><span class="str2">Balak -- 'devastator', a Moabite king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
