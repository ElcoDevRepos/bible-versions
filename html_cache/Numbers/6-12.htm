If the vow was broken, the individual had to start over. This rededication emphasizes the seriousness of the vow and the need for purity in one's commitment to God. It reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation unto the Lord, seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy.<p><b>and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering.</b><br>The guilt offering, or "asham," was required to atone for the breach of the vow. The use of a year-old male lamb signifies the costliness and value of atonement. This offering underscores the gravity of sin and the need for reconciliation with God. The concept of a guilt offering is further explored in <a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-19</a>, where it is used to address unintentional sins. This offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>But the preceding days shall not be counted,</b><br>This indicates that any previous time spent in the vow is nullified if the vow is broken. It highlights the importance of perseverance and faithfulness in one's spiritual commitments. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where perseverance in faith is emphasized (<a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>).<p><b>because his separation was defiled.</b><br>Defilement in the context of the Nazirite vow often involved contact with a dead body, which rendered the individual ceremonially unclean. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity and the need to avoid defilement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>. The concept of defilement and the need for cleansing is also a recurring theme in the New Testament, where Jesus cleanses and purifies believers (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who takes a special vow of separation to the LORD, characterized by abstaining from wine, not cutting hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom the Nazirite vow is dedicated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering.htm">Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering made to atone for unintentional sins or defilement, symbolizing the restoration of the relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/defilement.htm">Defilement</a></b><br>The state of being ceremonially unclean, which in this context refers to the Nazirite inadvertently coming into contact with a dead body.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/y/year-old_male_lamb.htm">Year-old Male Lamb</a></b><br>The specific animal required for the guilt offering, symbolizing innocence and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_vows.htm">The Seriousness of Vows</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow is a serious commitment to God, requiring careful adherence and a willingness to start over if defiled.
