The tribe of Naphtali settled in the northern part of Canaan, an area known for its fertile land and strategic location. This region later became significant in biblical history, as it was part of the area where Jesus conducted much of His ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-15</a>).<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization of the tribes into clans and families reflects the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. This structure ensured that each family maintained its inheritance and identity within the larger community. The detailed genealogical records were crucial for maintaining tribal boundaries and inheritance rights, as seen in the book of Joshua when the land was divided among the tribes.<p><b>counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant in Israelite culture as it marked the transition to adulthood and eligibility for military service. This census was not just a headcount but a preparation for war, as the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land and would need to conquer it. The age requirement underscores the responsibility and readiness expected of those who would defend the nation.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a duty for the able-bodied men of Israel, reflecting the theocratic nature of the nation where God was seen as the ultimate leader and protector. The army was not just a defense force but a means through which God executed His judgment and fulfilled His promises to Israel. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be soldiers of Christ, fighting spiritual battles (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_naphtali.htm">Sons of Naphtali</a></b><br>Naphtali was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and the second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.
