The Red Sea is a pivotal location in the Exodus narrative, where God miraculously parted the waters to allow the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This event is a powerful demonstration of God's deliverance and faithfulness. The crossing of the Red Sea is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from slavery to sin into new life in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>). The departure from the Red Sea signifies moving forward in faith, leaving behind the old life of bondage.<p><b>and camped in the Desert of Sin.</b><br>The Desert of Sin is a geographical area located between Elim and Mount Sinai. It is not to be confused with the concept of sin as wrongdoing; rather, it is a proper name for a specific location. This desert is part of the wilderness journey where the Israelites experienced God's provision and testing. In <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>, it is in the Desert of Sin that God provided manna and quail to feed the Israelites, teaching them reliance on His daily provision. The desert experience is symbolic of the Christian's journey of faith, where dependence on God is learned and spiritual growth occurs. The Desert of Sin also foreshadows the testing of Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), highlighting themes of trust and obedience to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Moses, who are on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>A significant location where God performed a miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>A desert region where the Israelites camped during their journey.

What looks like ordinary travel is actually obedience to the Lord&#8217;s command (<a href="/numbers/33-1.htm">Numbers 33:1-2</a>). After the dramatic deliverance at the sea, the people do not remain in the comfort of victory; they move when God says move, just as later the cloud will signal every departure (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17-18</a>). <a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a> records the same moment, reminding us that following God often means leaving a place of triumph to face new tests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the Red Sea</b><p>The memory of the Red Sea is never meant to fade. <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29-31</a> describes walls of water and the defeat of Egypt; <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> celebrates the miracle; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a> interprets it as a kind of baptism, uniting the nation to Moses under God&#8217;s saving power. Camping on its shores (<a href="/numbers/33-10.htm">Numbers 33:10</a>) gave Israel time to drink in the reality of redemption. Setting out from there anchors every future challenge to that undeniable rescue: &#8220;If God parted the waters, He can handle the wilderness ahead.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and camped</b><p>God&#8217;s people live in a rhythm of moving and resting. Camping is not lost time; it is time to learn dependence, receive instruction, and reorder life around God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/exodus/19-2.htm">Exodus 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6-8</a>). Each stop becomes a classroom. <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a> shows that the cloud&#8217;s settling determined where and how long they stayed, teaching responsiveness to divine timing. In our own walk, seasons that feel like pause often prepare us for the next march.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Desert of Sin</b><p>The Desert of Sin lies between Elim and Sinai (<a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>), a barren stretch where resources run out quickly. Here grumbling surfaces (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>), yet God provides manna and quail, revealing Himself as daily Provider. Later, El Shaddai gives water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). Wilderness is never random; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a> says it tests hearts and proves God&#8217;s faithfulness. Jesus points back to this scene when He calls Himself the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), inviting us to trust Him for every need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/33-11.htm">Numbers 33:11</a> may appear to be simple itinerary, yet each phrase highlights God&#8217;s purposeful leading. Israel obeys the command to set out, leaves the site of miraculous deliverance, camps under the watchful eye of the cloud, and faces new tests in the Desert of Sin where God again supplies. The verse quietly reassures us that the One who parts seas also guides daily steps and sustains His people in every wilderness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
