The use of oxen, significant for their strength and value, underscores the importance of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and the substantial amount of meat they provided, symbolizing abundance and God's provision. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where the offerer, priests, and sometimes the community shared in the meal.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were commonly used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace in biblical numerology, suggesting that this offering was an act of grace and favor. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>), linking this offering to themes of dedication and service to God.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were often used in sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-24</a>), symbolizing atonement and purification. The inclusion of goats in the peace offering highlights the comprehensive nature of the sacrifice, covering both thanksgiving and the need for reconciliation with God. The number five again emphasizes grace, suggesting a complete and gracious offering.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. They are often associated with innocence and purity, foreshadowing Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The repetition of the number five continues to emphasize the theme of grace and completeness in the offering.<p><b>This was the offering of Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.</b><br>Ahiezer, leader of the tribe of Dan, presents this offering as part of the dedication of the altar. His name means "my brother is help," and Ammishaddai means "people of the Almighty," reflecting the communal and divine aspects of the offering. The tribe of Dan, known for its later struggles with idolatry (Judges 18), here participates in the unified worship of Yahweh, highlighting the ideal of Israel's unity and devotion to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_ephraim.htm">Tribe of Ephraim</a></b><br>This verse is part of the offerings made by the leaders of the tribes of Israel during the dedication of the altar.
