The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, appearing in various narratives such as <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a> and <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>. The drawn sword signifies impending judgment or divine action, as seen in <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>. The donkey's ability to see the angel, while Balaam cannot, highlights the theme of spiritual blindness and insight, emphasizing that God can use any means to reveal His will.<p><b>she turned off the path and went into a field</b><br>The donkey's deviation from the path symbolizes a departure from the intended course, reflecting Balaam's own spiritual misdirection. In biblical literature, the "path" often represents the way of righteousness or God's will (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). The field may symbolize a place of safety or refuge, contrasting with the danger posed by the angel. This action underscores the theme of divine intervention and protection, even through unexpected means.<p><b>So Balaam beat her to return her to the path</b><br>Balaam's reaction to beat the donkey reveals his frustration and lack of spiritual perception. This act of violence contrasts with the donkey's discernment and obedience to divine warning. Balaam's insistence on returning to the path reflects his determination to pursue his own agenda, despite divine opposition. This moment foreshadows Balaam's eventual realization of God's sovereignty and serves as a reminder of the consequences of resisting divine guidance. The narrative invites reflection on the importance of humility and openness to God's direction, as further explored in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15-16</a>, where Balaam's error is used as a warning against false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

God is opening the animal&#8217;s eyes to a reality Balaam&#8217;s spiritual dullness cannot perceive (cf. <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;angel of the LORD&#8221; frequently appears in pivotal moments, often as a manifestation of God&#8217;s own presence (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). His appearance here is a clear warning that Balaam&#8217;s mission opposes God&#8217;s will (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By allowing the donkey to see, God shows that status and intellect are no guarantee of spiritual insight; humble receptivity is (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With a drawn sword in his hand</b><p>&#8226; A drawn sword signals imminent judgment; it is not a casual visit but a threat of lethal force should Balaam persist (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God is patient, yet His patience has limits when His holiness is challenged (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6&#8211;7</a>). Balaam is moments away from facing divine wrath for his covetous intent (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She turned off the path and went into a field</b><p>&#8226; The donkey&#8217;s instinct to preserve life overrides her training. Creation itself obeys its Creator, even when mankind refuses (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>; <a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;path&#8221; Balaam insists upon represents his determination to secure profit through divination, while the detour represents God&#8217;s merciful intervention (<a href="/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Balaam beat her to return her to the path</b><p>&#8226; Balaam responds with violence, exposing his hard heart. A righteous man cares for his animals, but &#8220;the compassion of the wicked is cruel&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His anger blinds him further; he never pauses to consider why the donkey behaves unusually. The scene foreshadows God speaking through the animal to shame human arrogance (<a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28&#8211;30</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s beating contrasts with the angel&#8217;s silent warning. One wields a stick in ignorance; the Other holds a sword in righteous judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a> shows God using the unexpected&#8212;an ordinary donkey&#8212;to expose Balaam&#8217;s spiritual blindness and impending danger. While the angel&#8217;s drawn sword reveals divine judgment against rebellion, the donkey&#8217;s detour embodies God&#8217;s mercy, delaying punishment and giving Balaam space to repent. The episode reminds us that God sees every hidden motive, that He can speak through the lowliest means, and that resisting His clear warnings leads only to greater peril.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ass saw the angel of the Lord.</span> This was clearly part of the miracle, the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> which was to exhibit in such a striking manner the stupidity and blindness of the most brilliant and gifted intellect when clouded by greed and selfishness. It is nothing to the point that the lower animals have a quicker perception of some natural phenomena than men, for this was not a natural phenomenon; it is nothing to the point that the lower animals are credited by some with possessing "the second sight," for all that belongs to the fantastic and legendary. If the ass saw the angel, it was because the Lord opened her eyes then, as he did her mouth afterwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the donkey</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
