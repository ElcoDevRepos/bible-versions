The term "foreigner" refers to a "sojourner" or "stranger" living among the Israelites, indicating that God's covenant community was open to those outside ethnic Israel who desired to follow Him. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's plan for all nations, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises Abraham that all peoples on earth will be blessed through him. The Passover itself is a significant event commemorating Israel's deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing redemption and foreshadowing Christ's sacrificial death as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the foreigner must adhere to the same regulations as the Israelites when observing the Passover. The Passover statute includes specific instructions found in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, such as the selection of a lamb, the manner of its preparation, and the prohibition against leavened bread. This requirement underscores the importance of unity and equality within the worship community, as well as the necessity of obedience to God's commands. It also points to the idea that true worship of God requires submission to His established order, a principle echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>).<p><b>You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase reinforces the principle of equality before God, as both the foreigner and the native-born Israelite are subject to the same laws. This reflects God's impartiality and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17-19</a>, where God commands Israel to love the foreigner. The equal application of the law prefigures the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), highlighting the unity of believers in the body of Christ. This inclusivity foreshadows the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, emphasizing the universal scope of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner (Ger)</a></b><br>A non-Israelite residing among the Israelites who desires to participate in the Passover.

It involves specific rituals and ordinances as outlined in the Torah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The native people of Israel, God's chosen people, who were given the Law through Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who established the Passover as a perpetual ordinance for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/statute_and_ordinances.htm">Statute and Ordinances</a></b><br>The specific laws and regulations given by God regarding the observance of the Passover.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_worship.htm">Inclusivity in Worship</a></b><br>God's invitation to the foreigner to participate in the Passover demonstrates His desire for inclusivity in worship.

God&#8217;s covenant people were not to keep the Passover as an ethnic club (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48&#8211;49</a>).<p>&#8226; Even before Israel crossed the Jordan, the Lord highlighted His heart for the nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Participation was voluntary&#8212;&#8220;wants to&#8221;&#8212;yet once the desire was expressed, it had to be honored. No Israelite could block the door God had opened (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The Passover pointed forward to Christ, &#8220;our Passover Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).
