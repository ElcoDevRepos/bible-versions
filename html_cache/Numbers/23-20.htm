The context is significant as it highlights the sovereignty of God over human intentions. Despite Balak's desire to harm Israel, God commands Balaam to bless them instead. This demonstrates God's protective hand over His chosen people and His ability to use even those outside the covenant community to fulfill His purposes. The command to bless reflects God's unchanging promise to Abraham that his descendants would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>He has blessed,</b><br>The blessing here refers to God's favor and protection over Israel. This is consistent with the Abrahamic Covenant, where God promised to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants and curse those who curse them. Theologically, this underscores the idea that God's blessings are irrevocable and not subject to human manipulation. It also points to the concept of divine election, where God chooses to bless whom He wills, independent of human actions or desires.<p><b>and I cannot change it.</b><br>Balaam acknowledges the futility of opposing God's will. This phrase emphasizes the immutability of God's decrees. In the broader biblical narrative, it reflects the theme that God's purposes cannot be thwarted by human schemes. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>, which states that no one can annul what God has purposed. Theologically, it points to the sovereignty of God and His ultimate control over history. This also prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of God's blessings, which cannot be altered or revoked by human actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.
