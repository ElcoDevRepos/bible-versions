It underscores the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and the enduring nature of His laws. This forward-looking perspective is consistent with other biblical passages that stress the importance of teaching God's laws to future generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>if a foreigner residing with you</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners highlights the openness of the Israelite community to those outside their ethnic group. This reflects God's intention for Israel to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The presence of foreigners in Israel was common due to trade, warfare, and migration. This provision ensures that those who choose to live among the Israelites are integrated into the religious life of the community.<p><b>or someone else among you</b><br>This phrase broadens the scope to include not just foreigners but any non-Israelite who might be present. It emphasizes inclusivity and the universal application of God's laws. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching that the gospel is for all people, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>wants to prepare a food offering</b><br>Food offerings were a significant part of Israelite worship, symbolizing fellowship with God and gratitude for His provision. The desire to participate in such offerings indicates a willingness to worship the God of Israel. This act of worship by a foreigner signifies a recognition of and submission to the God of Israel, similar to the faith of Rahab and Ruth.<p><b>as a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a common biblical expression denoting God's acceptance of a sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). It signifies that the offering is made in accordance with God's instructions and with a sincere heart. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live lives that are a pleasing aroma to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>he is to do exactly as you do</b><br>This command ensures uniformity in worship practices, preventing division and maintaining the sanctity of the offerings. It underscores the principle that there is one standard for worship, applicable to both Israelites and foreigners. This foreshadows the New Testament teaching that there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile in Christ (<a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>), as all are called to worship God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner (Ger)</a></b><br>In the Hebrew context, a "ger" is a non-Israelite residing among the Israelites. This term emphasizes the inclusion of those who are not native-born but choose to live among God's people and follow His laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law through Moses.
