His father, Enan, is mentioned only in genealogical contexts, indicating the importance of lineage and tribal leadership in Israelite society. The naming conventions reflect the cultural emphasis on familial and tribal identity. Ahira's role as a leader underscores the structured organization of the Israelite camp, as each tribe had a designated leader responsible for its people. This structure is reminiscent of the patriarchal system seen throughout the Old Testament, where family heads played crucial roles in guiding and representing their kin.<p><b>was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali</b><br>The tribe of Naphtali, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant. This tribe was known for its valor and swiftness, as seen in the blessing of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>, which describes Naphtali as a "doe set free that bears beautiful fawns." The division of the tribe refers to the military and logistical organization necessary for the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. Each tribe had its own division, which included warriors, families, and resources, highlighting the need for order and preparedness in their travels. The mention of Naphtali here connects to the broader narrative of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, where each tribe would eventually receive its inheritance. The tribe of Naphtali's future territory would be in the northern part of Canaan, a region later associated with significant events in the life of Jesus Christ, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee, the land of Naphtali.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahira_son_of_enan.htm">Ahira son of Enan</a></b><br>Ahira is identified as the leader of the tribe of Naphtali during the Israelites' wilderness journey.
