Joshua, originally named Hoshea, was from the tribe of Ephraim and was Moses' assistant. Caleb was from the tribe of Judah. Their faithfulness and trust in God's promises set them apart from the other spies. Joshua would later succeed Moses as the leader of Israel, leading the people into the Promised Land. Caleb, known for his wholehearted devotion to God, would receive Hebron as his inheritance. Their lineage and roles highlight the importance of faith and obedience in God's plan.<p><b>who were among those who had spied out the land</b><br>The mission to spy out the land of Canaan was a pivotal moment for the Israelites. The twelve spies were chosen to assess the land's fertility and the strength of its inhabitants. This reconnaissance mission was meant to prepare the Israelites for the conquest of Canaan, the land promised to them by God. However, only Joshua and Caleb returned with a positive report, trusting in God's ability to deliver the land into their hands. This phrase underscores their unique perspective and faith compared to the other ten spies who incited fear and rebellion among the people.<p><b>tore their clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes was a traditional expression of grief, mourning, or distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures. By tearing their clothes, Joshua and Caleb were demonstrating their deep sorrow and frustration over the Israelites' lack of faith and rebellion against God. This act was a public display of their anguish over the people's refusal to trust in God's promise and power. It also served as a call to repentance, urging the Israelites to turn back to God and believe in His ability to fulfill His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_son_of_nun.htm">Joshua son of Nun</a></b><br>One of the twelve spies sent to explore the land of Canaan.
