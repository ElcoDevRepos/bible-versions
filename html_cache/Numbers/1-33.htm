Ephraim and his brother Manasseh were adopted by Jacob as his own sons, granting them equal status with his other sons (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>). This adoption effectively gave Joseph a double portion of inheritance, as Ephraim and Manasseh each became a tribe. Ephraim held a significant position among the tribes, often representing the northern kingdom of Israel in later biblical history. The tribe's territory was centrally located in the land of Canaan, which later became a strategic and influential region. Ephraim's prominence is also seen in prophecies, such as those in Hosea, where the tribe is often used symbolically to represent the whole of Israel.<p><b>numbered 40,500</b><br>The census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> was conducted to determine the number of men eligible for military service, specifically those aged twenty and above. The figure of 40,500 reflects the military strength of the tribe of Ephraim at that time. This number is significant when considering the overall population and military capabilities of the Israelites as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The census was not only a practical measure for organizing the camp and preparing for conquest but also a demonstration of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The specific number also highlights the growth of the tribe since their time in Egypt, showcasing God's provision and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's younger son, Ephraim.
