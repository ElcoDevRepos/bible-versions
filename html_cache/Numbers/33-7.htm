This movement signifies a step further into reliance on God, as the Israelites leave behind the relative safety of known territories. Etham's exact location is uncertain, but it is often associated with the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula. This journey reflects the Israelites' obedience to God's guidance, as they follow the cloud by day and the fire by night.<p><b>and turned back to Pi-hahiroth</b><br>The phrase "turned back" suggests a change in direction, which may have seemed illogical to the Israelites. Pi-hahiroth is believed to be near the Red Sea, and this maneuver placed the Israelites in a seemingly vulnerable position, trapped between the sea and the pursuing Egyptian army. This strategic move was orchestrated by God to demonstrate His power and deliverance. The name Pi-hahiroth may mean "mouth of the gorges," indicating a geographical feature that could have been a narrow pass or valley.<p><b>opposite Baal-zephon</b><br>Baal-zephon was likely a location associated with a deity worshiped by the Egyptians, possibly a mountain or a temple. The mention of Baal-zephon highlights the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt. This confrontation underscores God's supremacy over all false gods and His ability to protect and deliver His people. The presence of Baal-zephon serves as a reminder of the cultural and religious context in which the Israelites lived, surrounded by polytheistic beliefs.<p><b>and they camped near Migdol</b><br>Migdol, meaning "tower" or "fortress," suggests a place of military significance, possibly a watchtower or fortification. The Israelites' encampment near Migdol indicates a strategic position, providing a vantage point or a defensive location. This setting emphasizes the tension and anticipation before the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea. The mention of Migdol also connects to the broader narrative of God's protection and provision, as He leads His people through seemingly insurmountable challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/etham.htm">Etham</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness where the Israelites camped during their exodus from Egypt.
