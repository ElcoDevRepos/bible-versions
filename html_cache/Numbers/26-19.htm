Er and Onan were his first two sons, born to his Canaanite wife, Shua's daughter. This highlights the intermingling of the Israelites with the Canaanites, which was often discouraged due to the potential for idolatry and cultural assimilation. The story of Er and Onan is found in <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, where Er is described as wicked in the sight of the Lord, leading to his death. Onan's refusal to fulfill his duty of levirate marriage to his brother's widow, Tamar, also resulted in his death. This narrative underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences of sin.<p><b>but they died in the land of Canaan</b><br>The land of Canaan, a region that encompasses modern-day Israel and surrounding areas, was the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. The deaths of Er and Onan in Canaan serve as a reminder of the Israelites' early presence in the land, even before the Exodus and conquest under Joshua. Their deaths also prefigure the struggles and moral challenges the Israelites would face in Canaan, a land filled with pagan practices. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment and the necessity of righteousness, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The deaths of Er and Onan also foreshadow the eventual establishment of Judah's line through Tamar, leading to the birth of Perez, an ancestor of Jesus, highlighting God's sovereignty and redemptive plan through flawed human history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/er.htm">Er</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Judah, who was wicked in the sight of the Lord and was put to death by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/onan.htm">Onan</a></b><br>The second son of Judah, who also displeased the Lord and was put to death for his actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, whose lineage is significant in the history of Israel and the genealogy of Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the sons of Judah died, which is significant as the Promised Land for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census_of_israel.htm">The Census of Israel</a></b><br>Numbers 26 records a census of the Israelites, taken as they prepare to enter the Promised Land, highlighting the continuity and faithfulness of God's promises despite human failure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Er and Onan's deaths remind us that sin has serious consequences.

<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2-3</a>). <a href="/bsb/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a> recounts a second census taken in the wilderness, and the writer pauses to mention Judah&#8217;s earliest sons to trace the tribe&#8217;s roots and highlight God&#8217;s faithfulness in preserving His covenant line (<a href="/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Genealogies in Scripture are never filler; they tether every generation to God&#8217;s unfolding promise.<p>&#8226; Though Judah produced five sons (Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah), only three survived to carry the lineage forward (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were Er and Onan</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-6.htm">Genesis 38:6-10</a> provides the background:<p>&#8220;Now Judah had two sons, Er and Onan&#8230;But Er, Judah&#8217;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; so the LORD put him to death&#8230;And Onan knew that the offspring would not be his&#8230;So the LORD put him to death as well&#8221;.<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; Firstborn status did not shield Er from judgment; righteousness matters more than birth order (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Onan&#8217;s deliberate refusal to honor the levirate duty exposed a heart of self-interest, illustrating that God judges motives, not merely actions (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their removal underscores that no human obstacle&#8212;whether sin or death&#8212;can thwart God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan (<a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they died</b><p>The deaths of Er and Onan are recorded twice more (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>;

God&#8217;s discipline of Er and Onan served as both warning and purification, ensuring the tribe&#8217;s moral integrity for the sake of future generations (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Judah lost two sons, the Lord preserved the messianic line through Perez and Zerah, born to Tamar (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Canaan</b><p>Their deaths occurred before Jacob&#8217;s family moved to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a> tells us they were already deceased). Canaan was the land God promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), so the statement roots the event in the very territory pledged by covenant.<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; The contrast between early judgment in Canaan and later multiplication in Egypt highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty over place as well as people (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in judgment, the scene is set within promise; God&#8217;s plan for Israel in Canaan would not be derailed (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-19.htm">Numbers 26:19</a> reminds us that genealogy matters because it showcases the faithful thread of God&#8217;s promise. Er and Onan, though first in line, forfeited their place through unrighteousness, demonstrating that covenant privilege demands covenant faithfulness. Yet their deaths did not stall God&#8217;s purpose; He preserved Judah&#8217;s line&#8212;and ultimately our Savior&#8212;through other sons. The verse stands as both sober warning and steady assurance: the Holy God judges sin, yet His redemptive plan presses on, firmly anchored in the very land He vowed to give His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.--</span>See <a href="/context/genesis/38-6.htm" title="And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.">Genesis 38:6-10</a>, and Note.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/26-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[were] Er</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6147.htm">Strong's 6147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Er -- two men of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Onan,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
