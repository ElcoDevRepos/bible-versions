Fertile soil was crucial for sustaining life and prosperity. The Promised Land was often described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating its potential for abundance. The fertility of the land would confirm God's promise to give the Israelites a prosperous homeland. This inquiry also echoes the blessings and curses associated with the land's productivity found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>Are there trees in it or not?</b><br>Trees were a sign of a healthy ecosystem and provided essential resources such as food, shade, and wood. The presence of trees would indicate a well-watered and fertile land. In biblical symbolism, trees often represent life and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). The question about trees also connects to the Garden of Eden, where trees were central to the narrative of life and knowledge (<a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>).<p><b>Be courageous and bring back some of the fruit of the land.</b><br>The command to be courageous underscores the potential challenges and fears the spies might face. Courage is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with faith in God's promises (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Bringing back fruit would serve as tangible evidence of the land's fertility and God's faithfulness. This act of bringing back fruit can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on bearing spiritual fruit (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><b>(It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)</b><br>The timing of the reconnaissance mission during the grape harvest provides a specific historical and agricultural context. The first ripe grapes typically appear in late summer, around July or August, indicating the time of year. This detail highlights the land's potential for producing valuable crops. Grapes and vineyards are significant in biblical imagery, often symbolizing joy, abundance, and God's blessing (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The mention of grapes also foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who instructed the spies to explore the land of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>A group of twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, sent to scout the land of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that God had assured to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_season_of_first_ripe_grapes.htm">The Season of First Ripe Grapes</a></b><br>This indicates the time of year, likely late summer, when the first fruits were ready for harvest, symbolizing the abundance of the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land's_fertility.htm">The Land's Fertility</a></b><br>A key aspect of the spies' mission was to assess the productivity and potential of the land, which was crucial for the Israelites' future settlement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_obedience.htm">Courage in Obedience</a></b><br>The spies were instructed to be courageous.
