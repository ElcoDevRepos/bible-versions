The Israelites were instructed to take vengeance on the Midianites for leading them into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). The "plunder" refers to the goods and livestock taken as a result of the victory. In ancient warfare, it was common for the victors to take spoils, which included livestock, goods, and sometimes people. This practice was not only a means of wealth acquisition but also a demonstration of divine favor and victory. The soldiers' taking of spoils was a fulfillment of God's command and a sign of His provision for the Israelites.<p><b>675,000 sheep,</b><br>The large number of sheep indicates the wealth and prosperity of the Midianites, as livestock was a primary measure of wealth in ancient times. Sheep were valuable for their wool, milk, and meat, and they played a significant role in the economy and daily life of the people. The specific number, 675,000, underscores the magnitude of the victory and the abundance of resources that God provided to the Israelites. This abundance can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to bless His people materially when they obey His commands. The large number also highlights the thoroughness of the Israelites' victory and the completeness of God's judgment against the Midianites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was commanded by God to take vengeance on the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that opposed Israel and led them into idolatry and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_soldiers.htm">Israelite Soldiers</a></b><br>The men who went to battle against the Midianites and collected the spoils.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunder.htm">Plunder</a></b><br>The goods and livestock taken from the Midianites after their defeat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command.htm">God's Command</a></b><br>The directive given to Moses to execute judgment on the Midianites for their role in leading Israel astray.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' victory and the subsequent plunder were a direct result of their obedience to God's command.
