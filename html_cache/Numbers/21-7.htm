The act of coming to Moses signifies acknowledgment of his leadership and their need for mediation. In the broader context of the wilderness journey, the Israelites often approached Moses when they faced dire situations, recognizing his role as God's appointed leader and mediator.<p><b>&#8220;We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you.</b><br>Here, the Israelites confess their sin, which is a crucial step in the process of repentance. Speaking against the LORD and Moses reflects a recurring theme of rebellion and complaint throughout the Israelites' journey (e.g., <a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>). This acknowledgment of sin is essential for reconciliation with God, as seen in other biblical instances where confession precedes divine forgiveness (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.&#8221;</b><br>The request for intercession highlights Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The presence of snakes, or serpents, is significant as they are often symbolic of sin and judgment (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-14</a>). The plea for their removal indicates a desire for relief from the consequences of their sin, paralleling the human need for deliverance from sin's penalty.<p><b>So Moses interceded for the people.</b><br>Moses' intercession is a demonstration of his leadership and compassion, despite the people's rebellion. This act of intercession is a precursor to the ultimate intercession of Christ, who prays for believers (<a href="/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>). Moses' willingness to intercede reflects the biblical principle of loving one's enemies and praying for those who persecute you (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). Moses' actions here are a testament to his character and his commitment to the well-being of the Israelites, serving as a model for spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.
