The Levites were divided into clans, each with specific duties related to the tabernacle. This census was part of a broader organization of the Israelite camp, emphasizing order and structure in worship. The concept of numbering by clans highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israel, which was crucial for maintaining the purity and continuity of religious service.<p><b>totaled 2,750.</b><br>The specific number of 2,750 Kohathites indicates the size of this group eligible for service, which was men aged 30 to 50. This precise counting underscores the importance of each individual's role in the community and the meticulous nature of God's instructions. The number reflects the practical needs of the tabernacle's operation, ensuring there were enough men to carry out the duties without overburdening any single individual.
