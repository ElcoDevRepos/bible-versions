The choice of a male goat is significant, as goats were common in the region and accessible for the Israelites. The male goat symbolizes strength and vitality, which are essential qualities for a sacrifice meant to cover sin. This specific animal was chosen by God to represent the people's sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and purify the people. It highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for a substitute to bear the penalty. The sin offering points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross. <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a> explains that the law, including these offerings, was a shadow of the good things to come, fulfilled in Christ.<p><b>to make atonement for you</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the shedding of blood. In the Old Testament, atonement was a temporary covering of sin, requiring repeated sacrifices. This foreshadows the perfect and final atonement made by Jesus, as described in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, where God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of His blood. The concept of atonement underscores God's holiness and justice, as well as His mercy and grace in providing a way for sinners to be reconciled to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including those concerning offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these instructions to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice in the Old Testament, intended to atone for sin and restore the relationship between the people and God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites performed their sacrifices and offerings, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement</a></b><br>A significant event in the Jewish calendar where offerings, including sin offerings, were made to atone for the sins of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The sin offering in <a href="/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5</a> underscores the necessity of atonement for sin.

Worship in Israel was not left to personal creativity; every act and element was to be &#8220;included&#8221; exactly as God prescribed (<a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds us that all true worship today still rests on divine instruction, not human preference (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By inserting the sin offering into the larger list for the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2&#8211;6</a>), God ensures that the people remember their need for cleansing even while celebrating.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one male goat</b><p>&#8226; The singular &#8220;one&#8221; underscores sufficiency: one representative sacrifice for the whole nation (cf. <a href="/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a>).<p>&#8226; A male goat was frequently used when leaders or the congregation sinned (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23&#8211;26</a>; 4:27&#8211;31).<p>&#8226; Goats reappear on the Day of Atonement&#8212;one slain, one released&#8212;prefiguring Christ, who both dies for sin and bears it away (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a sin offering</b><p>&#8226; A sin offering dealt specifically with guilt before God; its blood was applied for purification (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlighted that sin is not merely a mistake but an offense requiring substitutionary death (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah later speaks of the Messiah as a &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>), fulfilled when Jesus &#8220;offered Himself without blemish to God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to make atonement for you</b><p>&#8226;

God provides the means, but each worshiper must identify with it (<a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; New Testament writers echo this truth: &#8220;He Himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>), and &#8220;by His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5</a> folds a single male goat into the joyous offerings of the Feast of Trumpets to proclaim an unchanging message: celebration without cleansing is empty. God insists we &#8220;include&#8221; atonement, providing a sin-bearing substitute so His people may draw near.
