A tenth of an ephah would be approximately 2 quarts or 2 liters. This specific measurement indicates the precision and care required in offerings to God, reflecting the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. The use of a tenth may also symbolize completeness or a portion dedicated to God, similar to the tithe.<p><b>with each of the seven male lambs</b><br>The number seven often signifies completeness or perfection in the Bible, seen in the seven days of creation and the sevenfold Spirit of God. Offering seven male lambs could symbolize a complete and perfect offering to God. Male lambs were considered valuable and without blemish, representing purity and innocence. This foreshadows Christ, the Lamb of God, who was without sin and offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice for humanity's sins. The repeated emphasis on male lambs in sacrificial contexts underscores the importance of purity and the foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_trumpets.htm">Feast of Trumpets</a></b><br>A significant event in the Jewish calendar, during which these offerings were made as part of the prescribed rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Understanding the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The sacrificial system was a means for the Israelites to maintain a right relationship with God.

<a href="/bsb/numbers/29.htm">Numbers 29</a> describes the offerings for the Feast of Tabernacles on the seventh month; each day had specific sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34&#8211;36</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 4 falls within instructions for Day 1, following a list of thirteen bulls, two rams, and seven male lambs without blemish (<a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven male lambs&#8221; focuses on the grain offering that accompanies the lambs, not the animals themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What Is an Ephah?</b><p>&#8226; An ephah was a standard dry measure; a tenth is roughly two quarts/liters.<p>&#8226; Each lamb required the same amount&#8212;showing uniform devotion and equality before God (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Mixing the flour with oil symbolized the Spirit&#8217;s empowering presence (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why the Grain Offering Matters</b><p>&#8226; It acknowledged God as provider of daily bread while the burnt offering expressed total surrender (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning a portion produced &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD,&#8221; affirming God&#8217;s fellowship with His people (<a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Grain was bloodless&#8212;reminding Israel that every aspect of life, not just life-blood, belongs to the Lord (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Number Seven</b><p>&#8226; Seven lambs mirrored the biblical pattern of completeness and covenant fullness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Tabernacles, the daily counts of bulls decreased, but the seven lambs stayed constant, underscoring continual perfection in worship (<a href="/numbers/29-17.htm">Numbers 29:17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32</a>, 35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Looking Ahead to Christ</b><p>&#8226; The whole sacrificial system foreshadowed Christ, the &#8220;once for all&#8221; offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The grain accompanying each lamb hints at Jesus, the &#8220;bread of life,&#8221; presented to the Father in perfect obedience (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as oil mixed with flour, the Spirit rested on Him without measure (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>; <a href="/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Personal Application</b><p>&#8226; Worship still involves bringing God our best in grateful recognition of His provision (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Consistency&#8212;&#8220;with each of the seven male lambs&#8221;&#8212;calls believers to regular, wholehearted giving, whether resources, time, or praise (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The uniform measure encourages fairness and sincerity, avoiding partiality in devotion (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4</a> instructs Israel to present &#8220;a tenth of an ephah&#8221; of fine flour with each of the seven lambs offered on the first day of Tabernacles. This precise, repeated grain offering underscored God&#8217;s provision, Israel&#8217;s continual gratitude, and the completeness of their worship. Ultimately, the practice points to Christ&#8212;the perfect Lamb and living Bread&#8212;inviting us today to respond with consistent, wholehearted devotion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and one-tenth [of an ephah]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;i&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6241.htm">Strong's 6241: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tenth part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male lambs.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1489;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(lak&#183;ke&#183;&#7687;e&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3532.htm">Strong's 3532: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamb</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/29-4.htm">Numbers 29:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/29-4.htm">OT Law: Numbers 29:4 And one tenth part for every lamb (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/29-3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 29:3"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 29:3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/29-5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 29:5"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 29:5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
