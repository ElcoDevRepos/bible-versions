Morning is frequently a time of divine encounters or significant actions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> when Abraham rises early to obey God's command. It suggests readiness and determination in Balaam's actions.<p><b>Balaam got up</b><br>Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is a complex figure who appears in the narrative as someone who hears from God but is also swayed by material gain. His rising signifies his decision to proceed with the journey, despite previous divine warnings. This action reflects human agency and the tension between divine will and personal ambition.<p><b>saddled his donkey</b><br>The act of saddling a donkey is practical, indicating preparation for travel. Donkeys were common means of transportation in the ancient Near East, used by people of various social standings. This detail emphasizes Balaam's intent to journey, aligning with cultural practices of the time. The donkey later becomes a significant character in the narrative, highlighting themes of divine intervention and revelation.<p><b>and went with the princes of Moab</b><br>The princes of Moab represent the political and spiritual opposition to Israel. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was often in conflict with Israel. Balaam's association with these princes underscores the tension between following God's command and succumbing to external pressures. This alliance foreshadows the ensuing conflict and divine intervention, as seen in the broader narrative of <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>. The Moabites' fear of Israel's growing power sets the stage for Balaam's journey and the subsequent oracles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is approached by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites. Balaam is known for his interactions with God and his eventual blessing of Israel instead of cursing them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_princes_of_moab.htm">The Princes of Moab</a></b><br>Representatives sent by Balak, the king of Moab, to persuade Balaam to curse the Israelites. They symbolize the worldly pressures and temptations that can lead one away from God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A region east of the Dead Sea, inhabited by the Moabites. Moab is often depicted in the Bible as an adversary of Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_donkey.htm">The Donkey</a></b><br>Balaam's donkey plays a significant role in the subsequent account, where it becomes an instrument of God's intervention, highlighting God's control over all creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who fears the Israelites and seeks to use Balaam's prophetic abilities to curse them. Balak represents the fear and opposition that the world often has towards God's plans and people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god_over_worldly_pressure.htm">Obedience to God Over Worldly Pressure</a></b><br>Balaam's initial decision to go with the princes of Moab, despite God's clear instructions, serves as a reminder to prioritize obedience to God over succumbing to worldly pressures and temptations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Balaam's journey with the Moabite princes illustrates the danger of compromising one's faith and values for personal gain or acceptance. Believers are called to stand firm in their convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_intervention.htm">God's Sovereignty and Intervention</a></b><br>The account that follows Balaam's journey highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to intervene in unexpected ways. Trusting in God's plan, even when it seems contrary to human logic, is essential.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_influence.htm">The Power of Influence</a></b><br>Balaam's account serves as a cautionary tale about the power of influence. As believers, we must be mindful of how our actions and decisions can impact others, either leading them towards or away from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_22_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Balaam_saddle_his_donkey.htm">Why did Balaam "saddle his donkey" despite God's earlier warning in Numbers 22:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_God_s_will_like_Balaam.htm">How can we discern God's will when facing decisions like Balaam in Numbers 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Balaam_on_resisting_temptation.htm">What lessons from Balaam's actions apply to resisting temptation in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Balaam_s_journey_vs_Proverbs_obedience.htm">How does Balaam's journey in Numbers 22:21 relate to obedience in Proverbs 3:5-6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_daily_actions_with_God_s_will.htm">What steps can we take to align our actions with God's will daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_permit_Balaam_to_join_Balak_s_men.htm">Why did God allow Balaam to go with Balak's men in Numbers 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Balaam_s_journey_lessons_on_obeying_God.htm">What does Balaam's journey in Numbers 22:21 reveal about obedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_22_21_Free_will_vs_divine_plan.htm">How does Numbers 22:21 challenge the concept of free will versus divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_balaam_in_numbers_22.htm">Is there any historical or archaeological evidence supporting the existence of Balaam and the events of Numbers 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_untrained_cows_go_straight.htm">How could untrained cows in 1 Samuel 6:7&#8211;12 pull the Ark straight to Beth Shemesh without wandering? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_a_donkey_speak_in_numbers_22.htm">How can a donkey speak in Numbers 22:28&#8211;30 without contradicting the known biological limitations of animals? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_was_god_angry_with_balaam_later.htm">If God permitted Balaam to go (Numbers 22:20), why did He become angry with him later (Numbers 22:22)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Numbers 22:21 Mean</div><b>In the morning</b><p>&#8220;So in the morning&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>) sets the scene with deliberate timing. Throughout Scripture, early rising often signals purposeful action&#8212;sometimes faithful (<a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>), other times misguided. Balaam&#8217;s promptness proves he is eager to act on what his heart already desires. Even though God allowed him to go (<a href="/numbers/22-20.htm">Numbers 22:20</a>), the following verse reveals divine anger (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22</a>), showing that speed without spiritual submission can lead to trouble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Balaam got up</b><p>Balaam&#8217;s physical motion mirrors an inner decision. His name will later symbolize greed-driven rebellion (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>). At this point he has heard God&#8217;s word, but getting up signals he is moving forward in self-interest:<p>&#8226; He wants the Moabite reward (<a href="/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; He thinks he can balance obedience with personal gain&#8212;a tension Scripture always exposes (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God lets him rise, illustrating <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>: when a heart insists, God may permit the chosen path to unfold as discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saddled his donkey</b><p>Like Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, Balaam prepares transportation himself, emphasizing personal responsibility. Yet the similarity highlights contrast: Abraham&#8217;s obedience sprang from faith; Balaam&#8217;s arises from compromise. The donkey, a humble beast of service (<a href="/1_samuel/25-20.htm">1 Samuel 25:20</a>), will soon speak, testifying that even creation can rebuke human folly (<a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>). Practical lessons:<p>&#8226; Every step of preparation carries moral weight (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God can turn ordinary means&#8212;this donkey&#8212;into extraordinary messages (<a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went with the princes of Moab</b><p>Balaam physically aligns with those opposing Israel. Walking with the wrong company often precedes spiritual drift (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>). Though God said, &#8220;Go with them, but only do what I tell you&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-20.htm">Numbers 22:20</a>), Balaam&#8217;s willingness to accompany pagan dignitaries exposes covenantal disloyalty (<a href="/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). Key points:<p>&#8226; Companionship shapes destiny.<p>&#8226; Partial obedience&#8212;going but failing to maintain God&#8217;s boundaries&#8212;soon invites God&#8217;s corrective intervention (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The princes&#8217; presence represents worldly allure; Balaam&#8217;s presence pictures a believer flirting with compromise (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a> captures more than a travel log. Balaam rises early, acts decisively, equips himself, and joins Moab&#8217;s princes&#8212;all outwardly ordinary choices that expose an inwardly divided heart. Scripture&#8217;s cross-references remind us that eagerness apart from obedience, preparation divorced from faith, and companionship with the ungodly set the stage for divine confrontation. The verse therefore warns believers to examine motives, align actions with God&#8217;s revealed will, and choose associations that foster faithfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Balaam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bil&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1109.htm">Strong's 1109: </a> </span><span class="str2">Balaam -- a prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
