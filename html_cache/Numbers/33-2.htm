The Israelites' journey was not random but directed by God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God leading His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, where God guides them with a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. It underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions, a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Moses recorded the stages of their journey</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet, was responsible for documenting the Israelites' journey. This act of recording serves as a historical account and a spiritual record, ensuring that future generations would remember God's faithfulness and the lessons learned. The practice of recording significant events is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>, where Moses writes down the law. This documentation also prefigures the role of Scripture as a record of God's dealings with humanity.<p><b>These are the stages listed by their starting points</b><br>The phrase indicates a systematic account of the journey, highlighting each stage from its beginning. This methodical approach reflects the orderliness of God's plan and the importance of remembering each step of the journey. The listing of stages serves as a reminder of the progress made and the challenges overcome, similar to the genealogies and lists found in other parts of the Bible, such as in Genesis and Chronicles. It also points to the spiritual journey of believers, where each stage of life is significant in the walk of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

It is more natural to read it with the verb "wrote;" and in that case we have a direct assertion that Moses wrote this list of marches himself by command of God, doubtless as a memorial not only of historical interest, but of deep religious significance, as showing how Israel had been led by him who is faithful and true faithful in keeping his promise, true in fulfilling his word for good or for evil. The direct statement that Moses wrote this list himself is strongly corroborated by internal evidence, and has been accepted as substantially true by the most destructive critics. No conceivable inducement could have existed to invent a list of marches which only partially corresponds with the historical account, and can only with difficulty be reconciled with it - a list which contains many names nowhere else occurring, and having no associations for the later Israelites. Whether the statement thus introduced tells in favour of the Mosaic authorship (as usually accepted) of the rest of the Book is a very different matter, on which see the Introduction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">command,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">recorded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7733;&#183;t&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
