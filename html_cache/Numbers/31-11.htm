This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God sometimes commanded the Israelites to take spoils as a form of divine judgment against the nations. The plunder often included valuable items such as gold, silver, and other goods. This act of taking spoils can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to provide for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>, where God promised the Israelites they would not leave Egypt empty-handed.<p><b>both people and animals</b><br>The inclusion of people and animals as part of the spoils reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of taking captives and livestock as part of the victory. Captives could be used as servants or integrated into the community, while animals were valuable for their economic and agricultural benefits. This practice is also seen in other biblical accounts, such as the conquest of Canaan, where livestock and captives were taken (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a demonstration of God's sovereignty over all creation, as He directs the outcomes of battles and the distribution of resources. Additionally, it foreshadows the ultimate redemption and gathering of people from all nations, as seen in the New Testament, where Christ's victory brings people from every tribe and tongue into His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was commanded by God to take vengeance on the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that had led Israel into sin through the counsel of Balaam, resulting in God's judgment upon them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were instructed to execute God's judgment on the Midianites and take the plunder.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunder_and_spoils.htm">Plunder and Spoils</a></b><br>The goods, people, and animals taken by the Israelites as a result of their victory over the Midianites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A prophet who advised the Midianites to lead Israel into sin, which ultimately led to their downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_divine_commands.htm">Obedience to Divine Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions in taking the plunder were in direct obedience to God's command.
