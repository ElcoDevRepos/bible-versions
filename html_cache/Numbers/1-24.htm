Gad's descendants settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in a region known for its fertile land, which was suitable for their large herds of cattle. This location was strategic for defense and trade, as it bordered other nations. The tribe of Gad was known for its warriors, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>, where they are described as brave and skilled in battle.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The Israelites maintained detailed genealogical records, which were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights. These records ensured that each tribe's lineage and land allotments were preserved. The emphasis on clans and families highlights the importance of community and kinship in ancient Israelite society. This system of organization also reflects God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants a great nation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>.<p><b>Counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant in Israelite culture as it marked the transition to adulthood and eligibility for military service. This census was not merely a headcount but a preparation for war, as God instructed Moses to count those who could serve in the army. The age requirement underscores the responsibility and readiness expected of young men to defend their nation. This practice is consistent with other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where young men were expected to serve in the military.<p><b>Who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite society, especially as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The ability to defend their territory and uphold God's covenant was paramount. The emphasis on military readiness reflects the ongoing challenges Israel faced from surrounding nations. This phrase also foreshadows the spiritual battles believers face, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where Paul describes the armor of God, drawing a parallel between physical and spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_gad.htm">Sons of Gad</a></b><br>Gad was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after one of Jacob's sons.

By the time of <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, the tribe had grown into a sizable force, fulfilling the pledge first hinted at when Jacob blessed Gad (<a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Gad&#8217;s location east of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/13-24.htm">Joshua 13:24&#8211;28</a>) later put them on the front lines of Israel&#8217;s battles, so an accurate, God-ordained census mattered for both defense and obedience.<p>&#8226;
