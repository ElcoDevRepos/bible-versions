Dan's name means "judge," reflecting the role of judgment and leadership. The tribe of Dan was known for its later migration to the northern part of Israel, as recorded in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>. This movement is significant in understanding the geographical spread of the tribes and their influence in different regions.<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The use of records indicates the importance of genealogical documentation in ancient Israel. This meticulous record-keeping ensured the preservation of tribal identity and inheritance rights. The division into clans and families highlights the social structure of the Israelites, where extended family units played a crucial role in community life and governance.<p><b>counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant as it marked the transition into adulthood and eligibility for military service. This age requirement underscores the importance of readiness and responsibility in the community. It also reflects the cultural emphasis on the role of young men in the defense and expansion of the nation.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a key duty for the men of Israel, as they were responsible for protecting the nation and fulfilling God's promises regarding the land. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people as a chosen nation, set apart to fulfill His purposes. The concept of a divinely ordained army can also be seen as a type of the spiritual warfare Christians are called to engage in, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_dan.htm">Sons of Dan</a></b><br>The tribe of Dan is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the fifth son of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.

It may, of course, be said that he had other sons not enumerated, but such an assumption is arbitrary and improbable in the face of the family genealogies in chapter 26. If he had any other sons, they did not leave any families behind them. But if the sojourning of the Israelites in Egypt was 430 years, according to the plain statement of <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>, even this increase is quite within possible, and even probable, limits, considering the peculiar circumstances and the known fecundity of the race. For if Hushim, who came into Egypt with his grandfather, had only three sons born to him within the next twenty-five years, and if his descendants doubled themselves every quarter of a century, which is not an uncommon rate of increase under certain circumstances, then his numbers would have fully reached 200,000 by the time of the exodus. Perhaps the most puzzling feature about the increase is the great inequality with which it was spread over the various tribes, a fact of which we cannot even suggest any explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/1-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
