Despite witnessing God's miracles in Egypt and His provision in the wilderness, they doubt His promise to give them the land. This question reveals their misunderstanding of God's intentions and His power. Historically, the Israelites were on the brink of entering the Promised Land, a fulfillment of the covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Their fear of the inhabitants, despite God's assurances, shows a lack of trust. This moment parallels other instances of doubt, such as when the disciples feared during the storm despite Jesus' presence (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>).<p><b>Our wives and children will become plunder.</b><br>The concern for their families highlights the Israelites' fear of the Canaanite nations, known for their strength and fortified cities (<a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28-29</a>). This fear is rooted in a lack of faith in God's protection and provision. The Israelites had previously seen God deliver them from Pharaoh's army, yet they now doubt His ability to protect their families. This reflects a common biblical theme where God's people struggle to trust Him fully, as seen in the story of Abraham and Sarah doubting God's promise of a son (Genesis 16).<p><b>Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the Israelites' desire to return to the familiarity of Egypt, despite the slavery they endured there. It highlights a recurring theme of longing for the past when faced with uncertainty, a lack of faith in God's promises, and a failure to recognize the freedom and future He offers. Egypt, in biblical typology, often represents bondage and sin, while the Promised Land symbolizes freedom and God's promises. This desire to return to Egypt contrasts with the call to move forward in faith, as seen in the New Testament call to leave behind the old life and press on toward the goal (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader appointed by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered, representing their past life of slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who delivered the Israelites and promised them the land of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Despite the challenges, believers are called to trust in God's promises and His faithfulness, just as the Israelites were called to trust in God's promise of the Promised Land.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_looking_back.htm">The Danger of Looking Back</a></b><br>The Israelites' desire to return to Egypt symbolizes a temptation to revert to old ways when faced with difficulties.

The people have just heard the majority report of the spies (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>) and immediately assume God intends harm.<p>- They ignore His earlier promise: &#8220;I will bring you up out of that land into a good and spacious land&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). By questioning His motive, they accuse the faithful God of plotting their destruction.<p>- Similar grumbling had surfaced at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>) and at Marah (<a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>). Each time, the LORD delivered; yet fear now drowns out memory.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a> looks back on this scene and links it to hardened hearts that &#8220;could not enter because of unbelief.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Our wives and children will become plunder.</b><p>- The people project their fears onto the most vulnerable, suggesting God cannot protect families.<p>- Ironically, the LORD later declares, &#8220;Your little ones &#8230; I will bring in, and they will enjoy the land that you have rejected&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>). What they feared for their children would become their children&#8217;s blessing.<p>- This reversal echoes Joseph&#8217;s words in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>&#8212;God turns intended harm into good. His covenant care extends to generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?</b><p>- Egypt represents slavery, forced labor, and despair (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>). Calling it &#8220;better&#8221; shows how unbelief distorts memory and values.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a> pictures the folly: &#8220;As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-11</a> warns believers not to &#8220;crave evil things as they did.&#8221; Longing for the old life is a refusal to trust God&#8217;s plan of freedom.<p>- The suggestion to appoint a new leader and return (<a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>) challenges Moses&#8217; leadership and, ultimately, God&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3</a> records a pivotal moment of distrust. The people accuse God of lethal intentions, imagine doom for their families, and prefer slavery to faith. Their words reveal unbelief, selective memory, and rebellion. Yet even here, God&#8217;s steadfast purpose shines: the very children they feared for would inherit the promise. The passage calls every generation to reject fear, remember God&#8217;s faithfulness, and follow Him into the freedom He has planned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land . . .?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And wherefore doth the Lord bring us into this land?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the land of Canaan, as clearly appears from the words which follow (comp. <a href="/numbers/15-18.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land where I bring you,">Numbers 15:18</a>, where the same Hiphil participle is used).
