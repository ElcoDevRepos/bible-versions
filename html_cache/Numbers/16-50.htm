His return to Moses signifies the completion of his priestly duty in interceding for the Israelites. This reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where a mediator stands between God and humanity, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as the High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It symbolizes God's desire to dwell with His people and foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The entrance signifies a place of access to God, where Moses and Aaron often received divine instructions.<p><b>since the plague had been halted</b><br>The halting of the plague demonstrates God's mercy and the effectiveness of Aaron's intercession. In the broader context of <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, the plague was a divine response to the rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. This event underscores the seriousness of rebellion against God's appointed leaders and the necessity of atonement. The cessation of the plague prefigures the ultimate atonement made by Christ, who halts the plague of sin and death through His sacrifice (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

His return underscores completed obedience; he did not pause until the assignment was finished (cf. <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Aaron&#8217;s movement back to Moses pictures restored order after rebellion (Korah&#8217;s uprising, <a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1&#8211;35</a>). God&#8217;s appointed leaders are again side-by-side, illustrating how unity among God-given authorities safeguards the people (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence&#8212;Aaron goes out, intercedes, then comes back&#8212;foreshadows Christ&#8217;s mediatorial work: &#8220;having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, He sat down at the right hand of God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Aaron&#8217;s return signals the task was effective and accepted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>&#8226; This location matters. God said, &#8220;There I will meet with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>). It is the divinely designated intersection of heaven and earth for Israel. By standing there, Moses and Aaron place themselves under God&#8217;s gaze, not human applause (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>; 20:6).<p>&#8226; The entrance functions as the nation&#8217;s spiritual headquarters. Moments earlier, the interior had been threatened by rebellion; now it is once more the focal point of covenant life (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming to the doorway rather than deep inside suggests accessibility. God&#8217;s mercy is not hidden behind curtains but is announced where people can see (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the plague had been halted</b><p>&#8226; The phrase looks back to v. 48: &#8220;the plague was halted&#8221;. God&#8217;s wrath is real (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>), yet it yields when atonement is made (<a href="/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Aaron&#8217;s incense symbolized intercessory prayer rising before God (<a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3&#8211;4</a>). When judgment stopped, it confirmed that the prescribed means of atonement works&#8212;God keeps His word (<a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm">Leviticus 16:11&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-12.htm">Numbers 17:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel learns that sin&#8217;s consequences are deadly, but God provides a mediator. This anticipates the greater plague of sin halted by Christ&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The halted plague also protects future generations by reminding them to submit to divine authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-50.htm">Numbers 16:50</a> shows the aftermath of divine intervention: Aaron the high priest completes his mediatory mission and reunites with Moses at God&#8217;s appointed meeting place, visibly proving that the deadly plague has ceased.
