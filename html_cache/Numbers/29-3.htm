It symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God. Fine flour, a product of human effort, represents the best of what people can offer. The mixing with oil signifies the presence and work of the Holy Spirit, as oil often symbolizes the Spirit in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This offering was a reminder of God's provision and the need for spiritual anointing in daily life.<p><b>three-tenths of an ephah with the bull,</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. The specific measurement of three-tenths of an ephah for the bull indicates the substantial nature of the offering, reflecting the importance and value of the sacrifice. Bulls were considered valuable animals, often used in significant sacrifices, symbolizing strength and leadership. This offering points to the need for a costly and complete dedication to God, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who gave Himself fully for humanity.<p><b>two-tenths of an ephah with the ram,</b><br>The ram, another important sacrificial animal, required a slightly smaller grain offering than the bull, indicating a hierarchy in the sacrificial system. Rams were often used in covenantal contexts, such as the ram caught in the thicket in <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>, which God provided as a substitute for Isaac. This substitutionary aspect prefigures Christ's atoning work, where He becomes the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The two-tenths of an ephah signifies a significant, yet lesser, offering compared to the bull, emphasizing the varied levels of sacrifice and dedication required in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The set of offerings and sacrifices commanded by God, which included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_trumpets.htm">Feast of Trumpets</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/numbers/29.htm">Numbers 29</a>, where specific offerings were to be made as part of this holy convocation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's instructions precisely, demonstrating their obedience and reverence for Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_grain_offering.htm">Symbolism of the Grain Offering</a></b><br>The grain offering, made of fine flour and oil, symbolizes dedication and thanksgiving to God, representing the fruits of human labor offered back to the Creator.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_holiness.htm">God's Provision and Holiness</a></b><br>The specific measurements and ingredients highlight God's provision and the holiness required in approaching Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_fulfillment.htm">Christ as the Fulfillment</a></b><br>The sacrificial system points to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice, inviting believers to live lives of spiritual sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_in_spirit_and_truth.htm">Worship in Spirit and Truth</a></b><br>While the physical offerings are no longer required, believers are called to worship God in spirit and truth, offering their lives as living sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 29:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Importance_of_offerings_in_worship_today_4.htm">How does Numbers 29:3 emphasize the importance of offerings in worship today?

Blending it with the flour shows that true worship combines tangible gifts and Spirit-enabled surrender.<p>&#8226; By pairing grain with animal sacrifices on the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1&#8211;2</a>), the LORD reminds His people that thanksgiving and dependence are expected every time they rejoice before Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three-tenths of an ephah with the bull</b><p>&#8220;three-tenths of an ephah with the bull&#8221;<p>&#8226; The bull is the largest animal in the burnt offering and therefore receives the largest grain portion (cf. <a href="/numbers/28-12.htm">Numbers 28:12</a>). Three-tenths of an ephah is about 11 quarts/10.5 liters&#8212;an offering of real substance.<p>&#8226; God ties the size of the grain gift to the magnitude of the life laid on the altar: generous worship for a costly sacrifice (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This proportion teaches that leadership and strength (often symbolized by the bull&#8212;<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>) demand a correspondingly weighty devotion.<p>&#8226; The literal measurements also affirm that obedience is not left to guesswork; the Lord dictates the details (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two-tenths of an ephah with the ram</b><p>&#8220;two-tenths with the ram&#8221;<p>&#8226; A ram is smaller than a bull; accordingly, its grain offering is reduced to about 7 &#189; quarts/7 liters (<a href="/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>). God&#8217;s expectations are proportionate yet still significant.<p>&#8226; The ram, used in earlier consecration rites (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15&#8211;18</a>), underscores substitution and covenant faithfulness. The supporting grain offering keeps the worshiper mindful that daily provision comes from the same God who accepts the blood.<p>&#8226; Even at a lesser amount, the two-tenth measure remains generous, pushing Israel to give beyond token gestures (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern&#8212;three-tenths, two-tenths, then one-tenth for each lamb in v. 4&#8212;illustrates graded responsibility: more influence or blessing calls for greater tangible response (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-3.htm">Numbers 29:3</a> spells out the exact grain offerings that must accompany the bull and ram of the Feast of Trumpets. Fine flour mixed with oil reflects the worshiper&#8217;s best produce, empowered by God&#8217;s Spirit. The three-tenth measure with the bull and the two-tenth with the ram show that God links the scale of our material gifts to the weight of the sacrifice offered, teaching proportionate, wholehearted devotion. Literal measurements remind believers that obedience is concrete, not abstract, and that every detail of worship points to the Lord who provides, consecrates, and receives our offerings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">along with their grain offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
