This marks a significant transition period as the older generation, who had been condemned to die in the wilderness due to their disobedience, was passing away, and a new generation was preparing to enter the Promised Land. The first month is likely Nisan, which is significant in the Jewish calendar as it includes Passover, a reminder of God's deliverance from Egypt.<p><b>the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and collective experience of the Israelites. Despite their frequent rebellions and complaints, they are still recognized as a single entity, God's chosen people. The term "congregation" suggests a formal assembly, highlighting their identity as a covenant community under God's leadership.<p><b>entered the Wilderness of Zin</b><br>The Wilderness of Zin is a desert region located in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula. It is distinct from the Wilderness of Sin, which is closer to Egypt. The Wilderness of Zin is characterized by its harsh, arid conditions, which tested the faith and obedience of the Israelites. This area is part of the broader Negev desert, and its challenging environment underscores the Israelites' dependence on God for survival.<p><b>and stayed in Kadesh</b><br>Kadesh, also known as Kadesh-barnea, is a significant location in the Israelites' journey. It served as a major encampment and a place of decision-making. Historically, Kadesh is associated with the Israelites' earlier refusal to enter the Promised Land, resulting in their 40 years of wandering. Archaeologically, Kadesh is identified with the site of Tell el-Qudeirat, where remains of ancient fortifications have been found. Kadesh represents both a place of failure and a place of preparation for the new generation.<p><b>There Miriam died and was buried</b><br>Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, was a prominent figure in Israel's history. She played a key role in the Exodus narrative, leading the women in song after the crossing of the Red Sea. Her death marks the end of an era, as she was part of the leadership that guided Israel out of Egypt. Miriam's burial in Kadesh signifies the passing of the old generation and the fulfillment of God's judgment that none of that generation, except for Caleb and Joshua, would enter the Promised Land. Her death also foreshadows the impending deaths of Aaron and Moses, highlighting the transition to new leadership under Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to the entire assembly of the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_zin.htm">The Wilderness of Zin</a></b><br>A desert region in the southern part of Canaan, representing a place of testing and reliance on God for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh.htm">Kadesh</a></b><br>A significant location in the wilderness journey of the Israelites, often associated with pivotal events and decisions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/miriam.htm">Miriam</a></b><br>The sister of Moses and Aaron, a prophetess and leader among the Israelites.

Some, however, are of opinion that the journey is the same as that which is mentioned in <a href="/numbers/12-16.htm" title="And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.">Numbers 12:16</a>, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>; and that the arrival at Kadesh was on the first month of the third year, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the year which followed the departure from Sinai, which departure took place on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year after the exodus.<p><span class= "bld">And the people abode in Kadesh.--</span>It is evident that the sojourn in Kadesh was a protracted one, whether Kadesh did, or did not serve as the head-quarters of the people from the second or third year of the exodus until that in which they entered into the land of Canaan. See <a href="/deuteronomy/1-46.htm" title="So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed there.">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>, where Moses describes the length of the sojourn in Kadesh by the words "many days," the same words which he employs in <a href="/numbers/20-15.htm" title="How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelled in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:">Numbers 20:15</a> to denote the length of the sojourn in the land of Egypt. It cannot, however, be inferred from the simple use of the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">abode </span>that the sojourn at Kadesh at the beginning of the fortieth year was of long duration (see <a href="/judges/11-17.htm" title="Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto.

Hence no legitimate conclusion can be drawn from the use of this word respecting the reference of the verse to an arrival at Kadesh at the beginning of the third or of the fortieth year after the exodus.

Probably a portion of the tribes had visited Kadesh many times during those years, and perhaps it had never been wholly abandoned. <span class="cmt_word">Into the desert of Zin,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if the western site be maintained for Kadesh, the Wady Murreh. See the note on Kadesh. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the first month.</span> In the month Abib (Nisan), the vernal month, when there was "much grass" (cf. <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>) in places at other seasons desert, and when traveling was most easy. From comparison of <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a> and the sequence of the narrative, it appears to have, been the first month of the fortieth, and last year of wandering, Then it was that they reassembled in the same neighbourhood from whence they had dispersed so long before (see the note before chapter 15). <span class="cmt_word">And the people abode</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kadesh.</span> From the date given in <a href="/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a> it would seem that they remained three or four months in Kadesh on this occasion. This delay may have been occasioned partly by the ingraining for Miriam (cf. verse 29), and partly by the necessity of awaiting answers from Edom and from Moab (see on verse 14). <span class="cmt_word">And Miriam died there, and was buried.</span> Nothing could be more brief and formal than this mention of the death of one who had played a considerable part in Israel, and had perhaps wished to play a more considerable part. It can scarcely, however, be doubted that her death in the unlovely wilderness was a punishment like the death of her brothers. There is no reason whatever to suppose that she had any part in the rebellion of Kadesh, or that the sentence of death there pronounced included her; she was indeed at this time advanced in years, rut that would not in itself account for the fact that she died in exile; it is, no doubt, to the arrogance and rebellion recorded in chapter 12 that we must look for the true explanation of her untimely end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
