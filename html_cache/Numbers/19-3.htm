His role in this passage highlights the importance of the priestly duties in maintaining the purity and holiness of the Israelite community. The priesthood was central to the religious life of Israel, acting as mediators between God and the people. This task being assigned to Eleazar signifies the sacred nature of the ritual and the need for a consecrated individual to oversee it.<p><b>and he will have it brought outside the camp</b><br>The instruction to take the sacrifice outside the camp is significant in the context of Israelite purity laws. The camp represented the dwelling place of God among His people, and anything unclean or associated with sin was to be removed from it. This act symbolizes the separation of sin from the community. It also prefigures the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was crucified outside the city of Jerusalem, bearing the sins of the world away from the presence of God.<p><b>and slaughtered in his presence</b><br>The act of slaughtering the sacrifice in the presence of the priest underscores the need for an authoritative witness to the ritual, ensuring it was conducted according to divine instructions. This mirrors the sacrificial system where the shedding of blood was necessary for atonement, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The presence of the priest also emphasizes the seriousness of the act, as it was not merely a ritual but a profound spiritual transaction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>Eleazar, the son of Aaron, is a key figure in the priesthood.

This underlines the priestly responsibility to mediate between a holy God and His people.<p>&#8226; By naming Eleazar rather than Aaron, God keeps Aaron free from any contact with the carcass, so he can continue his daily tabernacle ministry (<a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that cleansing from defilement is God&#8217;s work through the priesthood He appoints. <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a> points forward to the perfect High Priest who offers Himself once for all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will have it brought outside the camp</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Outside the camp&#8221; is where uncleanness is expelled (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-4</a>).

In after times, however, it was usually the high priest who officiated on this occasion, and therefore it is quite as likely that Eleazar was designated because he was already beginning to take the place of his father in his especial duties. <span class="cmt_word">Without the camp.</span> The bodies of those animals which were offered for the sin of the congregation were always burnt outside the camp, the law thus testifying that sin and death had no proper place within the city of God. In this case, however, the whole sacrifice was performed outside the camp, and was only brought into relation with the national sanctuary by the sprinkling of the blood in that direction. Various symbolic reasons have been assigned to this fact, but none are satisfactory except the following: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It served to intensify the conviction, which the whole of this ordinance was intended to bring home to the minds of men, that death was an awful thing, and that everything connected with it was wholly foreign to the presence and habitation of the living God. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It served to mark with more emphasis the contrast between this one offering, which was perhaps almost the only one they had in the wilderness, and those which ought to have been offered continually according to the Levitical ordinances. The red heifer stood quite outside the number of ordinary victims as demanded by the law, and therefore it was not slain at any hallowed altar, nor, necessarily, by any hallowed hand. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It served to prefigure in a wonderful and indeed startling way the sacrifice of Christ outside the gate. In later days the heifer was conducted upon a double tier of arches over the ravine of Kedron to the opposite slope of Olivet. <span class="cmt_word">That he may bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">her forth... and one shall slay her.</span> The nominative to both these verbs is alike unexpressed.
