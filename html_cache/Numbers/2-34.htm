It reflects the importance of following divine instructions, a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch. The Israelites' compliance is crucial for maintaining their covenant relationship with God. This obedience is reminiscent of the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God promises blessings for obedience. It also foreshadows the New Testament call for believers to obey Christ's commands (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>they camped under their standards in this way</b><br>The standards refer to the banners or flags representing each tribe of Israel. These standards were not only practical for organization but also held symbolic significance, representing the identity and unity of each tribe. The arrangement of the camp around the Tabernacle, as described in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, signifies the centrality of God's presence among His people. This organization prefigures the order and unity found in the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.<p><b>and set out in the same way,</b><br>The phrase indicates that the Israelites not only camped but also traveled in an orderly manner. This orderliness reflects God's nature as a God of order, not chaos (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The structured movement of the tribes ensured efficiency and protection during their journey through the wilderness. It also symbolizes the Christian journey, where believers are called to walk in an orderly manner, following Christ as the head (<a href="/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>).<p><b>each man with his clan and his family.</b><br>This highlights the importance of family and clan structures within the Israelite community. The emphasis on family units underscores the biblical value placed on family as the foundational social unit. It also reflects the communal aspect of Israelite society, where identity and inheritance were tied to one's family and tribe. This mirrors the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers, united in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people.

Earlier, after the census and tribal arrangements, &#8220;The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-54.htm">Numbers 1:54</a>).<p>- The pattern runs through Exodus: &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). Their faithfulness here echoes that same spirit.<p>- Obedience brings order and blessing. Jesus later ties love to obedience&#8212;&#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The principle is timeless: God speaks, His people respond without delay or debate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They camped under their standards in this way</b><p>- &#8220;The Israelites are to camp under their respective banners beside the flags of their families&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>). Each tribe&#8217;s banner affirmed identity yet highlighted unity within the larger covenant people.<p>- Practical benefits:<p>&#8226; Easy organization for two million people.<p>&#8226; Clear rally points in crisis.<p>&#8226; Visible testimony that the LORD, dwelling at the center in the tabernacle, was the focus of all life.<p>- <a href="/psalms/20-5.htm">Psalm 20:5</a> celebrates banners in worship: &#8220;May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And set out in the same way</b><p>- The marching order mirrored the camping order (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17, 24, 31</a>). Judah led, then Issachar and Zebulun; the tabernacle and Levites traveled centrally; Dan&#8217;s division brought up the rear.<p>- Consistency prevented chaos. &#8220;At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/9-23.htm">Numbers 9:23</a>).<p>- God is a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). Even mobility was worship, demonstrating trust that He directed every move.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each man with his clan and his family</b><p>- God values households. The census in <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> was by &#8220;clans and families.&#8221;<p>- Family placement ensured care for the vulnerable and accountability for all.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> calls parents to teach God&#8217;s words diligently at home; traveling as family units facilitated that discipleship.<p>- Joshua later reminds Israel, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), continuing the family-centered pattern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/2-34.htm">Numbers 2:34</a> caps the chapter by celebrating complete obedience. Israel accepted God&#8217;s precise blueprint, camped and marched as instructed, and honored both corporate unity and family identity. Obedience, order, and community link arms here&#8212;a picture of how God&#8217;s redeemed people, then and now, thrive when every movement centers on His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they pitched.</span> The Targum of Palestine (which embodies the traditional learning of the Palestinian Jews of the 17th century) says that the camp covered a space of twelve square miles. Modern writers, starting from some measurements of the Roman camps given by Polybius, compute the necessary space at three or three and a half miles square. This would require the strictest discipline and economy of space, and makes no provision for cattle; but supposing that the women and children were closely packed, it might suffice. It is, however, evident that there would be very few places in the wilderness, if any, where more than three square miles of fairly level ground could be found. In the plains of Moab the desired room might perhaps have been found, but scarcely anywhere in the wilderness of Paran. We must conclude, therefore, that this order of encampment was an ideal order, beautiful indeed by reason of its faultless regularity and equality, but only to be attained in practice as circumstances should permit, more or less. Indeed, that the foursquare symmetry of the camp had an ideal meaning and significance more really, because more permanently, important than its actual realization at the time, is evident from its recurrence again and again in the Apocalyptic writings (see <a href="/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>, and especially <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). It is impossible to help seeing that the description of the heavenly Zion is that of a city, but of a city modeled upon the pattern of the camp in the wilderness. Here is one of those cases in which the spiritual significance of an order is of such importance that it matters comparatively little whether it <span class="accented">could</span> be literally carried out or not. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/2-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
