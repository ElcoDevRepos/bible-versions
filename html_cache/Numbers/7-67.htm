In ancient Israel, silver was a valuable commodity, often used in trade and religious offerings. The weight of one hundred and thirty shekels indicates a substantial gift, reflecting the leader's commitment to God and the community. The use of the sanctuary shekel, a standard weight used in the tabernacle, underscores the importance of precision and uniformity in offerings, ensuring fairness and consistency in worship practices.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, is a symbol of wealth and devotion. Weighing seventy shekels, it complements the platter, together forming a significant offering. The bowl's purpose was likely practical, used in the preparation or presentation of offerings. The specific weight again highlights the importance of adhering to the sanctuary shekel, emphasizing the need for offerings to meet divine standards. This reflects the broader biblical theme of giving one's best to God, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>, where God condemns offerings that are less than the best.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a specific standard of weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring that all offerings were measured equally. This standardization reflects the order and structure God established for worship in Israel, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. It also points to the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>, where God commands the use of honest scales and measures. The sanctuary shekel serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the need for integrity in worship.<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, was a common form of sacrifice in ancient Israel, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God. The use of fine flour indicates the quality of the offering, as only the best was to be given to God. Oil, often associated with anointing and the Holy Spirit, adds a spiritual dimension to the offering. This type of offering is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>, where it is described as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
