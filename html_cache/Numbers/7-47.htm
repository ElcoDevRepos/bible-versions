The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in significant sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where peace offerings were shared among the priests, the offerer, and God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and abundance of the offering, as well as the offerer's desire to honor God with valuable livestock.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in various offerings, including sin offerings. In this context, the male goats contribute to the peace offering, emphasizing the offerer's desire for reconciliation and fellowship with God. The number five, repeated here, reinforces the theme of grace and favor.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and ideal for sacrifice. They symbolize innocence and purity, often associated with Christ, the Lamb of God. The repetition of the number five again underscores the abundance and grace inherent in the offering. The use of lambs in the peace offering points to the future sacrifice of Jesus, who would bring ultimate peace between God and humanity.<p><b>This was the offering of Eliasaph son of Deuel.</b><br>Eliasaph, a leader of the tribe of Gad, presents this offering on behalf of his tribe. His name means "God has added," which may reflect the blessings and increase that come from faithful worship and obedience. The mention of his father, Deuel, situates Eliasaph within the genealogical and tribal structure of Israel, emphasizing the communal and representative nature of the offering. This act of giving reflects the unity and collective worship of the Israelite community as they dedicate the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliasaph_son_of_deuel.htm">Eliasaph son of Deuel</a></b><br>Eliasaph was a leader of the tribe of Gad, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.
