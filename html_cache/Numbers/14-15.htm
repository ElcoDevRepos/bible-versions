The idea of killing "as one man" suggests a sudden and complete destruction, emphasizing the severity of God's potential judgment. This reflects the collective responsibility and unity of the people in their rebellion. Historically, the Israelites were a covenant community, and their actions were often judged collectively. This concept is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where the sin of one man brought consequences upon the entire nation.<p><b>the nations who have heard of Your fame</b><br>The fame of God among the nations refers to the reputation He established through the miraculous events of the Exodus, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. These events demonstrated God's power and sovereignty, not only to Israel but to surrounding nations. The ancient Near Eastern context was one where gods were often seen as territorial, but the God of Israel was shown to be supreme over all. This fame is also a precursor to the universal recognition of God's sovereignty, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22-23</a>, where all nations are called to acknowledge Him.<p><b>will say,</b><br>Moses is concerned about the perception of God's character among the nations. If God were to destroy Israel, it might be interpreted as a failure of His promises or power. This reflects the importance of God's reputation and the witness of His people to the world. Theologically, this points to the theme of God's name and glory being upheld, which is a recurring motif in Scripture. It also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on the church as a witness to the nations, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, interceding on behalf of the people to God.

Earlier, God had said, &#8220;I will strike them with pestilence and dispossess them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-12.htm">Numbers 14:12</a>). Moses knows the Holy One has every right to execute justice, as He did in the flood (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a>), at Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24&#8211;25</a>), and with Egypt&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>). Yet, like his prior intercession after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;14</a>), Moses pleads for mercy, not because Israel deserves it, but because God&#8217;s own purposes are at stake.<p>Key observations<p>- God&#8217;s holiness cannot overlook sin (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>), yet His mercy invites intercession (<a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>).<p>- True prayer holds God to His revealed character, echoing &#8220;The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this people</b><p>The phrase identifies Israel, the covenant community redeemed from Egypt. &#8220;You are a people holy to the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). Despite their rebellion, they remain &#8220;Your people and Your inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>). Their existence is tied to God&#8217;s promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a>).<p>Why that matters<p>- Covenant love (hesed) binds God to His word (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8&#8211;10</a>).<p>- To erase Israel would appear to nullify the sworn oath of <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2&#8211;3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as one man</b><p>The idiom means a sudden, total destruction&#8212;wiping out the entire nation in a single act. Gideon was told he would &#8220;strike the Midianites as one man&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>). Here, the scale would be absolute: not piecemeal discipline but instant annihilation.<p>Implications<p>- Such a sweeping judgment would leave no remnant, unlike the later exile where a remnant remained (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>- The nations would draw conclusions&#8212;not about Israel&#8217;s sin, but about Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the nations</b><p>These are the surrounding peoples already trembling because of God&#8217;s mighty deeds.

Philistines echo similar fear when the ark arrives: &#8220;Woe to us!
