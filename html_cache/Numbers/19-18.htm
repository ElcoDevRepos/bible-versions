This requirement underscores the importance of purity in worship and service to God. The man must be free from any defilement, highlighting the separation between the holy and the profane. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy and set apart (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>is to take some hyssop</b><br>Hyssop is a plant used in various purification rites in the Bible. It symbolizes cleansing and purification, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks God to cleanse him with hyssop. The use of hyssop in this context connects to the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>, where it was used to apply the blood of the lamb, foreshadowing Christ's sacrificial death.<p><b>dip it in the water</b><br>The water here is mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, as described earlier in <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>.
