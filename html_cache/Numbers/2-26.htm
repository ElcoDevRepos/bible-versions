The number 62,700 represents the men of fighting age, twenty years and older, who were able to go to war. This census was part of a larger organizational structure that God commanded Moses to implement for the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<br><br>The tribe of Asher was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and second son of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant. Asher's name means "happy" or "blessed," and the tribe was known for its abundance and prosperity, as reflected in Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, which speaks of Asher's rich food and delicacies.<br><br>The number 62,700 is significant as it reflects the growth and strength of the tribe since the initial census taken at Mount Sinai (<a href="/numbers/1-41.htm">Numbers 1:41</a>), where they numbered 41,500. This increase demonstrates God's blessing and faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<br><br>In the broader context of Israel's encampment, the tribe of Asher was positioned on the north side of the Tabernacle, alongside the tribes of Dan and Naphtali. This strategic placement was part of God's divine order, ensuring that each tribe had a specific role and place within the community.<br><br>The organization of the tribes around the Tabernacle also foreshadows the order and unity found in the body of Christ, where each member has a unique function and purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).
