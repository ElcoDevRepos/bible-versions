The concept of the "congregation" emphasizes the communal aspect of Israel's identity and their covenant relationship with God. In the Old Testament, the congregation often acted as a single entity, especially in matters of worship and sin. This collective identity is seen in other passages such as <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a> and <a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>, where the actions of the community as a whole are addressed.<p><b>and the foreigners residing among them</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners, or "sojourners," highlights the inclusive nature of God's covenant. These were non-Israelites who lived among the Israelites and chose to follow their laws and customs. This provision underscores the idea that God's mercy and forgiveness extend beyond ethnic Israel to all who align themselves with His people. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that salvation through Christ is available to all nations, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>.<p><b>will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness here is a divine act of grace, where God pardons the sins of the people. In the context of <a href="/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>, this forgiveness is contingent upon the offering of sacrifices as prescribed by the Law. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides forgiveness for all sins through His atoning death, as explained in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<p><b>since it happened to all the people unintentionally</b><br>The phrase "unintentionally" refers to sins committed in ignorance or without deliberate intent. The Law made a distinction between unintentional sins and willful disobedience, with different consequences for each. This reflects God's understanding of human fallibility and His provision for repentance and restoration. The concept of unintentional sin is further explored in <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>, emphasizing the need for a mediator and sacrifice to atone for such sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Law through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners_residing_among_them.htm">Foreigners Residing Among Them</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living within the community, who were also subject to the laws and provisions given by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unintentional_wrongdoing.htm">Unintentional Wrongdoing</a></b><br>Sins committed without intent or knowledge, highlighting the need for communal atonement and forgiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet through whom God delivered the Law to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation.htm">The Congregation</a></b><br>The collective body of the Israelites, emphasizing the communal aspect of worship and accountability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/communal_responsibility.htm">Communal Responsibility</a></b><br>The verse highlights the importance of community in the eyes of God.
