These curtains were integral to the structure and function of the tabernacle, serving as its walls and partitions. The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The curtains were made of fine linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, representing purity and royalty, and pointing to the holiness and majesty of God. This task highlights the importance of reverence and care in handling sacred objects, a principle that extends to the New Testament understanding of the Church as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>the Tent of Meeting with the covering of fine leather over it</b><br>The Tent of Meeting was another name for the tabernacle, emphasizing its role as the place where God met with Moses and the Israelites. The covering of fine leather, often translated as "porpoise" or "badger" skins, provided protection from the elements, symbolizing God's protection over His people. This covering also points to the humanity of Christ, who took on flesh to dwell among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), providing a covering for our sins through His sacrifice.<p><b>the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The entrance curtains were distinct from the other curtains, often made with intricate designs and colors, signifying the beauty and exclusivity of entering God's presence. Only the priests could enter the holy place, foreshadowing Christ as our High Priest who grants us access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The entrance symbolizes the way to God, fulfilled in Jesus who declared Himself the door (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), emphasizing that access to God is through Him alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gershonites.htm">The Gershonites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for carrying the curtains and coverings of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the Divine Presence, where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Another term for the tabernacle, emphasizing its role as a place where God met with Moses and the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coverings.htm">The Coverings</a></b><br>These include the curtains and various coverings made of fine materials, symbolizing the holiness and separation of the sacred space.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, relying on God's guidance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The Gershonites' role underscores the importance of following God's specific instructions in our lives, trusting that each task has a purpose in His greater plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_sacred_spaces.htm">The Significance of Sacred Spaces</a></b><br>The tabernacle's coverings remind us of the need to honor and protect the sacred spaces in our lives, whether physical places of worship or moments of personal devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity_of_roles.htm">Unity in Diversity of Roles</a></b><br>Just as the Gershonites had a unique role, each believer has a specific function within the body of Christ.
