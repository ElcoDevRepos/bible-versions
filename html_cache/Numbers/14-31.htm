This reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The children represent a new generation that will not bear the consequences of their parents' unbelief. This also underscores the biblical theme of God&#8217;s mercy and grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, which speaks of God keeping His covenant to a thousand generations.<p><b>whom you said would become plunder</b><br>The Israelites expressed fear that their children would be taken as captives or killed by the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3</a>). This reflects a lack of trust in God's protection and provision. Historically, the fear of children becoming plunder was a common concern in ancient warfare, where the victors often took captives. This phrase serves as a rebuke to the Israelites' faithlessness and a reminder of God's power to protect and fulfill His promises.<p><b>into the land you have rejected</b><br>The land refers to Canaan, the Promised Land, which the Israelites refused to enter due to fear and disbelief after the report of the spies (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>). This rejection is symbolic of rejecting God's plan and provision. Theologically, it represents a broader theme of human rebellion against divine will, as seen in other biblical narratives like the story of Jonah. The rejection of the land is akin to rejecting God's blessings and purposes.<p><b>and they will enjoy it</b><br>This phrase indicates that the children will not only enter the land but will also thrive there, experiencing the fullness of God's blessings. It contrasts with the fate of the current generation, who will die in the wilderness. The enjoyment of the land is a fulfillment of God's promise and a testament to His faithfulness. It also prefigures the ultimate rest and blessing found in Christ, as the Promised Land is often seen as a type of the eternal rest believers find in Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.
