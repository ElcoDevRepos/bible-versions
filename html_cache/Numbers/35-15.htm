These cities were strategically located throughout the land of Israel to be accessible to all. The number six is significant, often representing completeness in biblical numerology. The cities of refuge symbolize God's justice and mercy, providing protection from the avenger of blood, a family member seeking retribution for the death. This system underscores the value of human life and the importance of due process.<p><b>for the Israelites</b><br>The Israelites, as God's chosen people, were given specific laws to govern their society. The cities of refuge were part of the legal system that distinguished between murder and manslaughter, reflecting the sanctity of life. This provision ensured that justice was tempered with mercy, aligning with the character of God as both just and compassionate. The cities served as a reminder of God's covenant with Israel and His desire for them to live in a society marked by righteousness and fairness.<p><b>and for the foreigner or stranger among them</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners or strangers highlights the universality of God's justice and mercy. It reflects the biblical principle that God's laws and provisions were not only for the Israelites but also for those who lived among them. This inclusivity points to the broader biblical theme of God's concern for all humanity, foreshadowing the New Testament message of salvation available to all through Jesus Christ. It also emphasizes the importance of treating foreigners with fairness and compassion, as seen in other parts of the Mosaic Law.<p><b>so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally</b><br>The distinction between intentional and unintentional killing is crucial in biblical law. Unintentional killing, or manslaughter, did not carry the same moral culpability as murder. The cities of refuge provided a place for the accused to seek asylum and await a fair trial, preventing blood vengeance. This legal provision reflects the biblical principle of justice, ensuring that punishment is proportionate to the crime and that innocent blood is not shed.<p><b>may flee there</b><br>The act of fleeing to a city of refuge symbolizes seeking God's protection and justice. It required the individual to take immediate action to preserve their life, demonstrating the seriousness of the situation. This provision also points to the need for a mediator or place of safety, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who provides refuge for sinners seeking forgiveness and protection from the consequences of sin. The cities of refuge serve as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate refuge and advocate before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

"The cities of refuge," says Dr. Gill, "were of God's appointing: so Christ, as a Saviour and rock of refuge to His people, is appointed and foreordained of God; they were well known for refuges, as the Lord is in the palaces of Zion; they were open for all at all times, as Christ is for all sinners, even the chief of sinners--Jews or Gentiles; they are all one in Christ--the Israelites, and the stranger and sojourner; all impediments were removed out of the way of them, and plain directions given, as are in the Gospel, and by the ministers of it; and there is always room in Christ for such that flee to Him, as there was in those cities; and being in Him, they are safe from the curse and condemnation of the law, from wrath to come, and from the second death; and their redemption and atonement, peace and reconciliation, liberty, life and salvation, are owing to the death of Christ, their High Priest."
