It symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God. Fine flour, a product of human effort, represents the best of what one can offer. The mixing with oil signifies the presence and work of the Holy Spirit, as oil often symbolizes the Spirit in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This offering was a reminder of God's provision and the need for spiritual anointing in daily life.<p><b>three-tenths of an ephah with each bull,</b><br>An ephah was a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. The specific measurement of three-tenths of an ephah for each bull indicates the substantial nature of the offering, reflecting the importance and value of the sacrifice. Bulls were considered valuable animals, often used in significant sacrifices (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). This offering underscores the seriousness of approaching God with reverence and the need for atonement.<p><b>two-tenths of an ephah with the ram,</b><br>The ram, a less costly animal than the bull, required a smaller grain offering. This reflects the varying levels of sacrifice based on the type of animal, which in turn could symbolize different aspects of atonement and dedication. The ram is often associated with substitutionary sacrifice, as seen in the story of Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). The two-tenths measure maintains the principle of offering one's best, while also acknowledging the different roles and significances of various sacrifices within the broader sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices to maintain their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the Israelites performed sacrifices and offerings as commanded by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>A divinely instituted system of offerings, including grain offerings, which were a part of the Israelites' worship and atonement practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were journeying towards, where they would continue to practice these offerings as part of their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The specific instructions for offerings highlight the importance of obedience to God's commands.

Each burnt offering of animals was to be brought &#8220;together with their grain offerings.&#8221; That little phrase signals that worship was never meant to be one&#8211;dimensional. God required<p>&#8226; an animal (symbolizing life surrendered)<p>&#8226; plus a grain offering (symbolizing daily work and provision)<p><a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a> shows the grain offering as &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD,&#8221; emphasizing wholehearted devotion alongside the shedding of blood. <a href="/exodus/29-41.htm">Exodus 29:41</a> couples grain with the evening lamb, reinforcing that the people could not choose one element and ignore the other. <a href="/numbers/29-6.htm">Numbers 29:6</a> repeats the same structure for the Feast of Trumpets. The pairing teaches that all parts of life&#8212;our livelihood as well as our lives&#8212;belong to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fine Flour Mixed with Oil</b><p>The grain had to be &#8220;fine flour,&#8221; meaning sifted and free of husks or stones, an image of purity and excellence. In daily terms, Israel offered the very best of their produce, not leftovers. The flour was &#8220;mixed with oil,&#8221; pointing to:<p>&#8226; richness and nourishment (olive oil was prize produce, <a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>)<p>&#8226; joy and consecration (priests were anointed with oil, <a href="/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>)<p><a href="/leviticus/2-5.htm">Leviticus 2:5-7</a> repeats the oil mixture requirement, and <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> uses oil as a picture of God&#8217;s overflowing blessing. Together, the flour and oil underline that worship combines purity and gladness&#8212;never drudgery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Three-Tenths of an Ephah with Each Bull</b><p>An ephah was about 22 liters; three-tenths is roughly 6.6 liters&#8212;an ample portion. The larger the animal, the larger the grain that accompanied it. <a href="/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8-9</a> sets the same ratio: a bull receives three-tenths of an ephah. This consistency shows God values order and precision. It also demonstrates that greater blessing (a bull was costly) calls for greater gratitude. Second Samuel 24:24 illustrates the heart behind this: &#8220;I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two-Tenths of an Ephah with the Ram</b><p>Dropping from three-tenths to two-tenths (about 4.4 liters) aligns with the smaller size of a ram. God&#8217;s scale is fair and proportional&#8212;never demanding beyond provision (see <a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>). <a href="/numbers/15-6.htm">Numbers 15:6-7</a> prescribes the same grain measure for a ram in earlier law, reinforcing that worship is consistent year after year. By linking quantity to the animal, the Lord teaches stewardship: give in proportion to how He has supplied (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7-10</a> echoes this principle in New-Testament terms).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/28-28.htm">Numbers 28:28</a> shows worship that is comprehensive, pure, joyful, orderly, and proportional. God invites His people to bring life (the animal) and livelihood (fine flour and oil) together, giving the best and giving in measure to what He has entrusted. The passage underscores that every detail of Scripture is deliberate, reflecting a God who cares about both the heart and the particulars of faithful obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/28-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">along with their grain offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
