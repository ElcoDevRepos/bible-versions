This reflects the communal nature of justice in Israelite society, where the community played a role in maintaining order and righteousness. The concept of judgment by the congregation underscores the importance of collective discernment and wisdom, as seen in other passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>, where judges and officers are appointed in all towns.<p><b>between the slayer and the avenger of blood</b><br>The "slayer" refers to someone who has killed another person, while the "avenger of blood" is typically a close relative of the deceased, tasked with avenging the death. This practice is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern custom of blood vengeance, which was a way to uphold family honor and justice. The avenger of blood is mentioned in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/joshua/20-3.htm">Joshua 20:3</a>, where cities of refuge are established to protect those who have killed unintentionally.<p><b>according to these ordinances</b><br>The ordinances refer to the specific laws and guidelines given by God to Moses regarding cases of manslaughter and murder. These laws are detailed in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a> and provide a framework for distinguishing between intentional and unintentional killing. The emphasis on following divine ordinances highlights the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where God's law was the ultimate standard for justice. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's law as a guide for righteous living, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slayer.htm">The Slayer</a></b><br>This refers to the individual who has unintentionally killed another person.
