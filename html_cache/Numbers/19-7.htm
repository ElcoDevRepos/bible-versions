Washing clothes was a symbolic act of cleansing from defilement, often associated with sin or contact with death. In the broader context of <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>, this washing follows the handling of the ashes of the red heifer, which were used for purification. The act signifies a separation from impurity and a return to a state of holiness, reflecting the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>and bathe his body in water;</b><br>Bathing the body in water was a common purification ritual in ancient Israel, signifying a complete cleansing. Water is often used in the Bible as a symbol of purification and renewal. This act of bathing underscores the need for both external and internal purity, as the priest prepares to re-enter the community. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of baptism, which represents spiritual cleansing and rebirth.<p><b>after that he may enter the camp,</b><br>Re-entering the camp signifies the priest's restoration to the community after being temporarily set apart due to ritual impurity. The camp represents the dwelling place of God's people, and re-entry indicates that the priest has been cleansed and is now fit to resume his duties. This reflects the broader biblical theme of restoration and reconciliation with God and His people.<p><b>but he will be ceremonially unclean until evening.</b><br>The state of being ceremonially unclean until evening emphasizes the temporary nature of impurity and the process of purification. Evening marks the end of the day and often signifies a new beginning in biblical terms. This period of uncleanness serves as a reminder of the pervasive nature of sin and the need for continual purification. It also points to the ultimate purification through Jesus Christ, who provides a permanent cleansing from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the central figure in this verse, responsible for performing the purification rituals.

Every one of these details was devised in order to express the intensely infectious character of death in its moral aspect. The very ashes, which were so widely potent for cleansing (verse 10), and the cleansing water itself (verse 19), made every one that touched them, even for the purifying of another, himself unclean. At the same time the ashes, while, as it were, so redolent of death that they must be kept outside the camp, were most holy, and were to be laid up by a clean man in a clean place (verse 9). These contradictions find their true explanation only when we consider them as foreshadowing the mysteries of the atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/19-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
