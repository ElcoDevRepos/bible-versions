This vow is detailed in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a> and involves abstaining from wine, not cutting one's hair, and avoiding contact with the dead. The term "Nazirite" comes from the Hebrew word "nazir," meaning "consecrated" or "separated." This vow is a voluntary act of devotion, reflecting a deep desire to live a life set apart for God. Notable Nazirites in the Bible include Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist, each of whom had a significant role in God's plan.<p><b>when his time of separation is complete:</b><br>The Nazirite vow was typically for a specific period, although some, like Samson, were Nazirites for life. The completion of this period signifies the fulfillment of the vow and the individual's return to normal life. This completion is marked by specific rituals and sacrifices, indicating the importance of both the vow and its conclusion. The concept of separation for a time reflects the biblical theme of holiness and dedication, seen in other contexts such as the Sabbath and the Year of Jubilee.<p><b>He must be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was where God's presence dwelled among His people and where sacrifices and offerings were made. Bringing the Nazirite to the entrance signifies the public and communal aspect of the vow's completion. It underscores the importance of community in the spiritual life of Israel and the need for public acknowledgment of personal commitments to God. This act of coming to the Tent of Meeting also foreshadows the New Testament concept of presenting oneself as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>A person who has taken a vow of separation to dedicate themselves to the Lord.

All the Nazirites, however, of whom we read in Scripture were lifelong Nazirites: Samson (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>), Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>). In all these cases, however, the vow was made for them before their birth.
