The garments of the high priest were symbolic of his office and duties (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2-4</a>). The removal of these garments indicates the end of Aaron's service and life. This act also underscores the importance of proper succession in leadership roles within the Israelite community, ensuring continuity in worship and adherence to God's commandments.<p><b>and put them on his son Eleazar</b><br>By placing the garments on Eleazar, Moses is publicly affirming Eleazar as the new high priest. This transfer of authority is crucial for maintaining the spiritual leadership of Israel. Eleazar's new role is a fulfillment of God's earlier instructions regarding the priesthood (<a href="/exodus/29-29.htm">Exodus 29:29-30</a>). This act also prefigures the New Testament concept of Jesus as our High Priest, who mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Aaron died there on top of the mountain</b><br>Aaron's death on Mount Hor marks the end of an era for Israel. As the first high priest, Aaron played a pivotal role in establishing the priestly system and leading the people in worship. His death on the mountain, away from the camp, signifies a peaceful transition and the completion of his earthly duties. This event also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as Aaron was not permitted to enter the Promised Land due to earlier transgressions (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p><b>Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain</b><br>The descent of Moses and Eleazar from the mountain symbolizes the continuation of leadership and the ongoing journey of the Israelites. Moses, as the leader, and Eleazar, as the new high priest, together represent the unity of civil and religious authority. This moment foreshadows the eventual entry into the Promised Land, with Eleazar playing a key role in the distribution of the land (<a href="/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>). The descent also highlights the theme of transition and the faithfulness of God in providing leaders for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

This deliberate act follows the Lord&#8217;s command in <a href="/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26&#8211;27</a>, confirming that every detail of Israel&#8217;s worship life is ordered by God (cf. <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The garments signify Aaron&#8217;s God-given office as high priest; removing them shows that his ministry is ending, not the priesthood itself (<a href="/exodus/29-29.htm">Exodus 29:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses, acting as God&#8217;s representative, physically transfers the symbols of atonement and intercession, underscoring that positions in God&#8217;s service are never held by personal right but by divine appointment (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put them on his son Eleazar</b><p>&#8226; Eleazar, one of the two sons remaining after Nadab and Abihu&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>), now receives the mantle of leadership, demonstrating both continuity and God&#8217;s grace in preserving the priestly line (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Transferring the garments before Aaron&#8217;s death publicly validates Eleazar&#8217;s authority, preventing confusion in the camp (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates later successions&#8212;Joshua after Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>) and Elisha after Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13</a>)&#8212;reminding us that God&#8217;s work goes on even when His servants change.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron died there on top of the mountain</b><p>&#8226; Mount Hor becomes a solemn witness to the consequences of unbelief at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>); yet Aaron&#8217;s death is peaceful, illustrating both God&#8217;s holiness and His mercy (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>).<p>&#8226; At 123 years old (<a href="/numbers/33-39.htm">Numbers 33:39</a>), Aaron finishes his race under God&#8217;s timing, echoing the biblical pattern that life and death belong to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The location&#8212;away from the camp&#8212;emphasizes that sin has repercussions, but the covenant continues; the priestly garments, not the man, must remain among the people (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain</b><p>&#8226;

The movement down the mountain foreshadows Christ&#8217;s own descent after His transfiguration, where heavenly glory met earthly need (<a href="/mark/9-9.htm">Mark 9:9</a>), pointing to ministry that lives among the people rather than apart from them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a> records a solemn handoff orchestrated by God: Aaron&#8217;s garments come off, Eleazar&#8217;s calling begins, Aaron dies in peace, and ministry marches on.

The difference in the circumstances of the death of the two brothers is remarkable. Both Moses and Aaron were excluded from the land of promise by reason of transgression. Both died upon the top of a mountain. But whilst Moses died in solitary grandeur, and the place of his burial was unknown, Aaron ascended the mount "in the sight of all the people," and died in the presence of Moses and Eleazar. The death of Aaron was an indication of the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood. "They truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death; but this man because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood" (<a href="/context/hebrews/7-23.htm" title="And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:">Hebrews 7:23-24</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son.</span> This was done in token that the office was transferred; it was done out of sight, and far above, in token that the priesthood was perpetual, although the priest was mortal. <span class="cmt_word">Aaron died there.</span> In this case, as in that of Miriam (verse 1), and of Moses himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>), no details are given.
