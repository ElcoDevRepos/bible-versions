In the context of ancient Israel, cities provided protection against enemies and a stable environment for raising children. The emphasis on "little ones" highlights the importance of ensuring the next generation's security and prosperity. This directive aligns with the broader biblical theme of providing for one's family, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, which underscores the responsibility to care for one's household.<p><b>and folds for your flocks</b><br>The mention of "folds for your flocks" indicates the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites, where livestock was a primary source of wealth and sustenance. The tribes of Reuben and Gad had large herds, which necessitated adequate facilities for their care. This reflects the pastoral culture of the time, where wealth was often measured in livestock. The need for folds, or enclosures, underscores the importance of stewardship and responsible management of resources, a principle echoed in <a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-27</a>, which advises diligence in knowing the condition of one's flocks.<p><b>but do what you have promised.</b><br>This phrase is a reminder of the commitment made by the tribes of Reuben and Gad to assist the other Israelites in conquering the Promised Land before settling east of the Jordan. It underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one's word, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making vows and not fulfilling them. The call to honor promises is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's own faithfulness and the expectation that His people will mirror this attribute. This commitment also prefigures the New Testament call to integrity and truthfulness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_reuben_and_gad.htm">The Tribes of Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River because the land was suitable for their large herds and flocks.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who negotiated with the tribes of Reuben and Gad, ensuring they would still fulfill their responsibilities to help conquer the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land west of the Jordan River that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary for the Israelites, marking the edge of the land they were to inherit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_agreement.htm">The Agreement</a></b><br>The tribes of Reuben and Gad agreed to help the other Israelites conquer the land west of the Jordan before returning to settle in the land they desired.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_promises.htm">Integrity in Promises</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to honor our commitments, just as the tribes of Reuben and Gad were expected to fulfill their promise to Moses and the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_personal_desires_with_community_responsibilities.htm">Balancing Personal Desires with Community Responsibilities</a></b><br>The tribes desired land for their flocks but were reminded of their duty to the larger community.
