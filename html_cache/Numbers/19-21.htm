In the context of the Mosaic Law, a "permanent statute" indicates a regulation that is to be observed throughout generations. This reflects the unchanging holiness of God and His requirements for purity among His people. The concept of a permanent statute is seen in other parts of the Torah, such as the observance of the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16</a>) and the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>).<p><b>The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes:</b><br>The water of purification, made with the ashes of a red heifer, was used for ceremonial cleansing, particularly from contact with a dead body. The requirement for the one who administers the water to wash his clothes underscores the pervasive nature of impurity and the need for continual cleansing. This act of washing symbolizes the removal of impurity and is a precursor to the New Testament concept of spiritual cleansing through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>And whoever touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening:</b><br>This regulation highlights the paradox of the purification process: the water that cleanses also renders the one who touches it temporarily unclean. This reflects the seriousness with which God views sin and impurity. The temporary uncleanness until evening signifies a period of waiting and reflection, pointing to the ultimate purification through Jesus Christ, who cleanses believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The evening marks a new day, symbolizing renewal and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>As leaders of the Israelites, they were responsible for conveying God's laws and statutes, including the laws of purification.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The community to whom the laws of purification were given, emphasizing their need for holiness and separation from impurity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_water_of_cleansing.htm">The Water of Cleansing</a></b><br>A mixture made from the ashes of a red heifer, used for purification from sin and ceremonial uncleanness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites, where the laws of purification were particularly relevant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_heifer.htm">The Red Heifer</a></b><br>A unique sacrificial animal whose ashes were used in the water of cleansing, symbolizing purification and atonement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity.htm">The Importance of Purity</a></b><br>God's statutes emphasize the need for purity in His people, both physically and spiritually.

Israel could not decide when purity mattered; it always mattered (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;for the people&#8221; reminds us that holiness is communal. One person&#8217;s uncleanness affected the camp (<a href="/joshua/7-13.htm">Joshua 7:13</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, the deeper fulfillment of such enduring statutes is found in His once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>), yet the call to live set apart remains (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes</b><p>&#8226; The red-heifer ashes mixed with water (<a href="/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>) cleansed others, but the priest handling it still needed washing (<a href="/leviticus/16-26.htm">Leviticus 16:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Even a servant engaged in God-ordained ministry stayed aware of personal impurity&#8212;a safeguard against pride (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Clothing symbolized outward life; washing it pictured a fresh, public commitment to purity (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This anticipates the greater cleansing Christ grants: &#8220;how much more will the blood of Christ&#8230; cleanse our consciences&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whoever touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening</b><p>&#8226; Paradoxically, contact with the cleansing water rendered a person temporarily unclean.

In this case, as apparently above in verse 10, the regulations thus enforced might seem of trifling moment. But the whole design of this ordinance, down to its minutest detail, was to stamp upon physical death a far-reaching power of defiling and separating from God, which extended even to the very means Divinely appointed as a remedy. The Jew, whose religious feelings were modeled upon this law, must have felt himself entangled in the meshes of a net so widely cast about him that he could hardly quite escape it by extreme caution and multiplied observances; he might indeed exclaim, unless habit hardened him to it, "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/19-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
