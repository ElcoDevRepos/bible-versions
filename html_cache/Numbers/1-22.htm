Historically, the tribe of Simeon was known for its fierce and aggressive nature, as seen in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a> with the incident at Shechem. The tribe's inheritance was within the territory of Judah, as described in <a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>, indicating a close relationship between these two tribes. This positioning also reflects the prophecy of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>, where Simeon and Levi are scattered in Israel.<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization of the Israelites into clans and families was crucial for maintaining order and identity within the nation. This structure allowed for the preservation of genealogies, which were important for inheritance rights and fulfilling God's promises to Abraham's descendants. The records were likely kept meticulously, as seen in other parts of the Pentateuch, to ensure the accurate fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<p><b>counting one by one the names</b><br>The census was a detailed and systematic process, emphasizing the importance of each individual within the community. This methodical approach underscores the value of every person in God's eyes and the necessity of each member's contribution to the collective mission of Israel. It also reflects the administrative capabilities of Moses and the leaders, ensuring that the nation was prepared for both military and spiritual endeavors.<p><b>of every male twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant as it marked the transition into adulthood and eligibility for military service. This age requirement is consistent throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/30-14.htm">Exodus 30:14</a> and <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>. It highlights the readiness and responsibility expected of young men to defend and uphold the community's values and territory.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite society, as the nation was often engaged in battles to secure and maintain the land promised to them by God. The ability to serve in the army was not only a matter of physical capability but also a spiritual duty, as the Israelites were seen as God's chosen people tasked with executing His will on earth. This phrase also foreshadows the spiritual warfare theme found in the New Testament, where believers are called to be soldiers of Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>Simeon was the second son of Jacob and Leah.

His tribe&#8217;s mention early in the census shows that God recognizes each tribal identity. Though Simeon&#8217;s past included violence with Levi in Shechem (<a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; 49:5-7), the Lord still numbers his descendants, proving that grace and covenant promise endure. Simeon&#8217;s family lines appear again in <a href="/exodus/6-15.htm">Exodus 6:15</a> and later in the second census (<a href="/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12-14</a>), confirming continuity all the way to their inheritance in the land (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><p>Israel kept written genealogies.

By insisting on clan and family rolls, God displays:<p>&#8226; order rather than confusion (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>)<p>&#8226; accountability for every lineage (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>)<p>&#8226; faithfulness to promises made to Abraham&#8217;s seed (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Counting one by one the names</b><p>The census was not a rough estimate; Moses and Aaron recorded each man &#8220;one by one.&#8221; Precision matters: Scripture even gives Simeon&#8217;s exact total, &#8220;59,300&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-23.htm">Numbers 1:23</a>). The Lord who &#8220;counts the number of the stars&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>) also counts His people and calls them &#8220;by name&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).

God assigns responsibility when maturity is reached. Later, Levites began service at thirty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>), but regular warriors at twenty, showing distinct roles within Israel&#8217;s community. The second census maintains the same threshold (<a href="/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>), illustrating consistency in divine standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who could serve in the army</b><p>The census&#8217;s purpose was mobilization.
