Throughout the Pentateuch, Moses is portrayed as a prophet and leader who receives God's instructions for the Israelites. This divine communication underscores the authority of the message and the importance of obedience to God's commands. The phrase also highlights the role of Moses as a mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who serves as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The context of this passage is the census of the Israelites, which God commands to organize the community for their journey and eventual conquest of the Promised Land.
