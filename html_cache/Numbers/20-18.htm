This response reflects the historical tension between the two nations. The refusal to allow passage is rooted in this ancient rivalry, highlighting the ongoing fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where two nations would be divided.<p><b>&#8220;You may not travel through our land</b><br>Edom's land was strategically located, and allowing Israel passage would have been a significant gesture of goodwill. The King's Highway, a major trade route, ran through Edom, and denying access forced Israel to take a longer, more arduous route. This refusal underscores Edom's hostility and lack of hospitality, contrasting with the expected kinship between the two nations.<p><b>or we will come out and confront you with the sword.&#8221;</b><br>This threat of military action indicates Edom's readiness to defend its territory aggressively. The sword symbolizes conflict and war, emphasizing the seriousness of Edom's refusal. This confrontation foreshadows future conflicts between Israel and Edom, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13-14</a>, where David subdues Edom. The imagery of the sword also serves as a reminder of the spiritual battles faced by God's people, pointing to the ultimate victory through Christ, who is often symbolized as the Word, sharper than any two-edged sword (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

Because Esau and Jacob were twin brothers, Edom&#8217;s voice carries the weight of family responding to family. Yet the answer comes from a place of old rivalry (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; 27:41).<p>- Israel is nearing the end of its wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14&#8211;16</a>). Moses respectfully appeals to shared ancestry&#8212;&#8220;your brother Israel&#8221;&#8212;but Edom&#8217;s reply breaks the hope of brotherly goodwill (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- The conjunction &#8220;But&#8221; signals a sharp contrast between Israel&#8217;s courteous request and Edom&#8217;s hostile mindset, foreshadowing later tensions (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You may not travel through our land</b><p>- The denial is absolute. Edom withholds even temporary passage, ignoring Israel&#8217;s promise to stay on the King&#8217;s Highway, pay for water, and leave no damage (<a href="/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a>).<p>- This refusal sets up a pattern in which surrounding nations often bar Israel&#8217;s progress, yet God still steers His people toward the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>- The land Edom guards was never Israel&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>). God had earlier instructed Israel not to seize it by force, underscoring that the LORD can accomplish His plan without violating His own boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or we will come out and confront you with the sword</b><p>- Edom escalates from denial to threat, revealing the heart posture behind the words. This is not mere concern for resources; it is active hostility (<a href="/numbers/20-20.htm">Numbers 20:20</a>).<p>- Scripture often pairs Edom with violence against Israel&#8212;seen later when Edom rejoices over Jerusalem&#8217;s fall (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>). The warning here previews that entrenched animosity.<p>- Israel chooses obedience over retaliation, turning away rather than fighting a &#8220;brother&#8221; nation (<a href="/numbers/20-21.htm">Numbers 20:21</a>; 21:4). God honors this restraint, preserving the nation for future victories that He Himself will direct (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>; 20:4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a> records Edom&#8217;s flat refusal and threat as Israel seeks safe passage. The verse exposes lingering family hostility, an unwavering gatekeeper mentality, and a willingness to meet kin with deadly force. Israel&#8217;s peaceful request and patient withdrawal display trust that God&#8217;s promises do not require sinful shortcuts. Edom&#8217;s sword stands as a warning that earthly barriers may arise, yet God&#8217;s redemptive path for His people remains unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Edom said...
