The Israelites were led by the cloud of the Lord, which signified when they should set out or camp (<a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>). This movement was a part of their 40-year journey to the Promised Land, emphasizing obedience and reliance on God's guidance.<p><b>Aaron and his sons are to go in</b><br>Aaron and his sons, the priests, had the exclusive responsibility to handle the sacred objects of the Tabernacle. This highlights the importance of the priestly role in maintaining the holiness and order of worship. The priesthood was established in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>, and their duties were central to the spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>take down the veil of the curtain</b><br>The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31-33</a>). It symbolized the separation between God and humanity due to sin. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). This veil is later significant in the New Testament when it is torn at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), symbolizing direct access to God through Christ.<p><b>and cover the ark of the Testimony with it</b><br>The Ark of the Testimony, also known as the Ark of the Covenant, contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a jar of manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). Covering the Ark with the veil was a protective measure, signifying the sacredness and holiness of the Ark. The Ark represented God's presence and covenant with Israel.
