The context is the inheritance laws for the daughters of Zelophehad, as discussed in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27 and 36</a>. The issue arises from the potential loss of tribal land inheritance if daughters marry outside their tribe. This reflects the importance of maintaining tribal boundaries and inheritance within the Promised Land, as originally allocated by God through Moses and Joshua (Joshua 13-21). The preservation of tribal identity and land was crucial for maintaining the distinctiveness and order of the Israelite community.<p><b>their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of our fathers</b><br>The inheritance refers to the land portions allocated to each tribe, which were considered a perpetual possession given by God. The phrase "portion of our fathers" emphasizes the ancestral heritage and the divine promise to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). The land was not merely property but a fulfillment of God's covenant, symbolizing His faithfulness and the Israelites' identity as His chosen people.<p><b>and added to the tribe into which they marry</b><br>This highlights the legal and social implications of marriage in ancient Israel. Marrying into another tribe would result in the transfer of land inheritance, potentially altering the tribal boundaries established by God. This concern underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of each tribe's inheritance, as it was tied to their identity and role within the nation. The law sought to prevent the dilution of tribal lands and ensure that each tribe retained its God-given inheritance.<p><b>So our allotted inheritance would be taken away</b><br>The phrase reflects the anxiety of losing a divinely allotted inheritance, which was not only a matter of economic concern but also of spiritual and cultural significance. The inheritance was a tangible sign of God's promise and blessing. The potential loss of land would mean a loss of identity and a breach in the continuity of God's covenant with the people. This concern led to the stipulation that daughters who inherited land must marry within their tribe, ensuring the preservation of tribal inheritance and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">The Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These women were the daughters of Zelophehad, from the tribe of Manasseh.
