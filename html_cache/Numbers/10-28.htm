The Israelites' journey was not haphazard but carefully planned, reflecting God's sovereignty and orderliness. This mirrors the order seen in creation and the universe, highlighting God's nature as a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><b>for the Israelite divisions</b><br>The divisions refer to the tribal organization of the Israelites, each tribe having its specific place and role within the camp and during the march. This structure was established in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where God instructed Moses on how the tribes should encamp and set out. The divisions were led by their respective leaders, ensuring that each tribe maintained its identity and function. This organization foreshadows the body of Christ, where each member has a unique role and function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>as they set out</b><br>This phrase indicates the beginning of a journey, a significant moment as the Israelites moved from Sinai towards the Promised Land. It marks a transition from a period of receiving the Law and instructions to actively pursuing God's promises. The setting out is an act of faith and obedience, trusting in God's guidance and provision. It parallels the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to step out in obedience, trusting in God's promises and direction (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area through which the Israelites traveled after their exodus from Egypt, a place of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among His people, central to the Israelite camp and their worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/order_of_march.htm">Order of March</a></b><br>The divinely instructed arrangement for the tribes of Israel as they traveled, emphasizing order, obedience, and the presence of God at the center.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_obedience.htm">Divine Order and Obedience</a></b><br>God is a God of order, and He desires His people to live in obedience to His instructions.

The question may here be asked, which is considered more at large in the Introduction, how it was possible for a nation of more than two million souls, containing the usual proportion of aged people, women, and children, to march as here represented, in compact columns closely following one another, without straggling, without confusion, without incalculable suffering and loss of life. That the line of march was intended to be compact and unbroken is plain (amongst other things) from the directions given about the tabernacle. The fabric was sent on in advance with the evident intent that it should be reared up and ready to receive the holy things by the time they arrived. Yet between the fabric and the furniture there marched more than half a million of people (the camp of Reuben), all of whom had to reach the camping ground and turn off to the right before the Kohathites could rejoin their brethren. Now discipline and drill will do wonders in the way of ordering and expediting the movements even of vast multitudes, if they are thoroughly under control; the family organization also of the tribes, and the long leisure which they had enjoyed at Sinai, gave every opportunity of perfecting the necessary discipline. But it is clear that no discipline could make such an arrangement as the one above mentioned feasible under the ordinary circumstances of human life. It would be absolutely necessary to eliminate all the casualties and all the sicknesses which would naturally clog and hinder the march of such a multitude, in order that it might be compressed within the required limits of time and space. Have we any ground for supposing that these casualties and sicknesses <span class="accented">were</span> eliminated? In answering this question we must clearly distinguish between the journey from Sinai to Kadesh, on the borders of Palestine, <span class="accented">which was a journey of only eleven days</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>), and the subsequent wanderings of the people of Israel. It is the eleven days' journey only with which we are concerned, because it was for this journey only that provision was made and orders were given by the God of Israel. During the subsequent years of wandering and of excommunication, there can be no doubt that the marching orders fell into abeyance as entirely as the sacrificial system and the rite of circumcision itself. During these years the various camps may have scattered themselves abroad, marched, and halted very much as the circumstances of the day demanded. But that this was not and could not be the case during the short journey which <span class="accented">should</span> have landed them in Canaan is obvious from the whole tone, as well as from the particular details, of the commandments considered above. It is further to be borne in mind that the Divine promise and undertaking at the exodus was, impliedly if not explicitly, to bring the whole people, one and all, small and great, safely to their promised home. When the Psalmist asserts (<a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a>) that "there was not one feeble person among their tribes," he does not go beyond what is plainly intimated in the narrative. If of their cattle "not an hoof" must be left behind, lest the absolute character of the deliverance be marred, how much more necessary was it that not a soul be abandoned to Egyptian vengeance? And how could all depart unless all were providentially saved from sickness and infirmity? But the same necessity (the necessity of his own goodness) held good when the exodus was accomplished. God could not bring any individual in Israel out of Egypt only to perish in the wilderness, unless it were through his own default, he who had brought them <span class="accented">out</span> with so lavish a display of miraculous power was (we may say with <span class="accented">reverence</span>) bound also to bring them <span class="accented">in</span>; else they had been actual losers by obedience, and his word had not been kept to them. Under a covenant and a dispensation which assuredly did not look one hand's breadth beyond the present life, it must have seemed to be of the essence of the promise which they believed that not one of them should die or have to be left behind. And as the death or loss of one of God's people would have vitiated the temporal promise to <span class="accented">thegn</span>, so also it would have vitiated the eternal promise to <span class="accented">us.</span> For they were ensamples of us, and confessedly what was done for them was done at least as much for our sakes as for theirs. Now the promise of God is manifest unto every one that is included within his new covenant, viz., to bring him safely at last unto the heavenly Canaan, and that in spite of every danger, if only he do not draw back. The whole analogy, therefore, and the typical meaning of the exodus would be overthrown if any single Israelite who had crossed the Red Sea failed to enter into rest, save as the consequence of his own sin. We conclude, therefore, with some confidence that the ordinary incidents of mortality were providentially excluded from the present march, as from the previous interval; that none fell sick, none became helpless, none died a natural death. We know that the great difficulty of a sufficient supply of food was miraculously met; we know that in numberless respects the passage from Egypt to Canaan was hedged about with supernatural aids. Is there any difficulty in supposing that he who gave them bread to eat and water to drink, who led them by a cloudy and a fiery pillar, could also give them health and strength to "walk and not be weary"? Is it unreasonable to imagine that he who spake in his tender pity of the flight from Judaea to Pella, "Woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days," miraculously restrained for that season the natural increase of his people? <p> CHAPTER 10:29-32 THE INVITATION TO HOBAB (verses 29-32). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/10-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the order of march</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mas&#183;&#8216;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4550.htm">Strong's 4550: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pulling up, breaking (camp), setting out, a journey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the Israelite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">divisions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7779;i&#7687;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as they set out.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;s&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5265.htm">Strong's 5265: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull up, the tent-pins, start on a, journey</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/10-28.htm">OT Law: Numbers 10:28 Thus were the travels of the children (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/10-27.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 10:27"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 10:27" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/10-29.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 10:29"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 10:29" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
