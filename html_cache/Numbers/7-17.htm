Oxen were valuable animals, symbolizing strength and service, and their use in offerings indicated a significant act of worship and gratitude. The peace offering was shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer, symbolizing fellowship with God and the community.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and authority. The number five can represent grace in biblical numerology, suggesting an abundance of God's favor. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests, indicating a connection to holiness and dedication to God.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings, representing the removal of sin and impurity. The inclusion of goats in the peace offering highlights the comprehensive nature of the sacrifice, addressing both fellowship and atonement. The number five again emphasizes grace and completeness in the offering.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. They are often seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for the sins of the world. The repetition of the number five underscores the theme of grace and divine favor.<p><b>This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab.</b><br>Nahshon, a leader of the tribe of Judah, played a significant role in the Israelite community. His offering represents the leadership and responsibility of Judah, the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come.

In the sacrificial system laid out in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-15</a>, the peace (or fellowship) offering celebrated restored relationship with God. Unlike the burnt offering that was wholly consumed, portions of the peace offering were shared in a meal, underscoring communion between the worshiper, the priest, and the LORD. Paul echoes this theme when he writes, &#8220;He Himself is our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), showing how the ultimate fellowship with God is realized through Christ, who &#8220;made peace through the blood of His cross&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>, therefore, records each tribal leader publicly affirming that peace with God is possible only on His terms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of two oxen</b><p>The verse specifies &#8220;two oxen.&#8221; Oxen were the costliest animals one could offer (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), symbolizing strength and substantial sacrifice. David refused to give God that which cost him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>), and Nahshon&#8217;s two oxen show similar devotion. The &#8220;two&#8221; likely anticipates the dual direction of the peace offering&#8212;Godward and community-ward&#8212;because reconciliation with God overflows into harmony with His people (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five rams</b><p>Next come &#8220;five rams.&#8221; Rams were commonly linked to consecration (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15, 19</a>) and substitution (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). The number five frequently marks God&#8217;s gracious provision (as with the five Levitical offerings listed in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;7</a>, or the five loaves multiplied by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-20</a>). Thus, five rams highlight that consecration to God is grounded in His grace rather than human merit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five male goats</b><p>Goats often feature in sin and guilt offerings (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>), reminding Israel of the need for cleansing. <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13</a> emphasizes how &#8220;the blood of goats&#8221; pointed forward to the superior, cleansing blood of Christ. Including five goats within a peace offering reminds worshipers that fellowship with God must be preceded by atonement&#8212;graciously provided, not earned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Five male lambs a year old</b><p>Finally, Nahshon offers &#8220;five male lambs a year old.&#8221; A yearling lamb was considered prime and spotless (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). John the Baptist hailed Jesus as &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), and Peter adds that believers are redeemed &#8220;with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The repetition of five again spotlights grace; the lambs underscore innocence and substitution that bring lasting peace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab</b><p>Nahshon, prince of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>), presents this gift on the first of twelve successive days (<a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12-17</a>). Judah leads, fitting for the tribe from which &#8220;the scepter shall not depart&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Nahshon appears in the Messianic lineage (<a href="/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>), so his offering anticipates the ultimate Prince of Judah, Jesus Christ. By leading the way, Nahshon models wholehearted generosity and signals that Judah&#8217;s role is to point all Israel toward God&#8217;s coming King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-17.htm">Numbers 7:17</a> records a peace offering of costly oxen, consecrated rams, atoning goats, and spotless lambs&#8212;an abundant, grace-saturated gift from Nahshon of Judah. Each element highlights aspects of reconciliation, substitution, and joyful fellowship with the LORD, foreshadowing the perfect peace secured through the greater Son of Judah, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For a sacrifice of</span> <span class="cmt_word">peace offerings.</span> See <a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1, 6, 12</a>.
