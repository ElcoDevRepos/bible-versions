The removal of his garments symbolizes the transfer of the priestly office. The priestly garments were not just clothing but represented the authority and responsibilities of the high priest. This act underscores the importance of the priesthood being divinely appointed and orderly transferred, reflecting the sacredness of the office.<p><b>and put them on his son Eleazar.</b><br>Eleazar, Aaron's third son, is chosen to succeed him, indicating the continuation of the Levitical priesthood through Aaron's lineage. This transfer of garments and office is a public affirmation of Eleazar's new role. It highlights the hereditary nature of the priesthood in Israel, as established in <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>. Eleazar's future role is significant, as he will later assist in leading Israel and performing priestly duties, as seen in <a href="/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>.<p><b>Aaron will be gathered to his people</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a reunion with ancestors in the afterlife. It reflects the belief in an existence beyond death, where the faithful are gathered to their forebears. This concept is seen in <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> with Abraham and <a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a> with Isaac, indicating a continuity of faith and community beyond physical life.<p><b>and will die there.&#8221;</b><br>The location of Aaron's death is Mount Hor, as specified earlier in <a href="/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22-24</a>. This event marks a significant transition for the Israelites as they near the end of their wilderness journey. Aaron's death is a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as he was not permitted to enter the Promised Land due to his actions at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). This moment also prefigures the death of Moses, who will similarly not enter the land, emphasizing the theme of leadership transition and the fulfillment of God's promises through successive generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a key figure in the Exodus account.

The removal of the priestly robes from Aaron may be regarded as typical of the future disannulling of his priesthood when a priest after the order of Melchizedek should arise. "The succession of the priesthood," says Dean Stanley (who refers to Ewald's <span class= "ital">Geschichte, </span>5:13), "was made through that singular usage, preserved even to the latest days of the Jewish hierarchy, by the transference of the vestments and drapery of the dead High Priest to the living successor."
