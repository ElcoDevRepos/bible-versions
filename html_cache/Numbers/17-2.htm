The Israelites are the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, and are organized into twelve tribes. This phrase emphasizes the importance of communication between God and His chosen people, highlighting Moses' role as a prophet and leader.<p><b>and take from them twelve staffs</b><br>The staff is a symbol of authority and leadership in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Each tribe is represented by a staff, signifying their unique identity and leadership structure. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or the people of God, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles in the New Testament.<p><b>one from the leader of each tribe</b><br>This specifies that the staffs are to be taken from the leaders, indicating their authority and responsibility over their respective tribes. The leaders are often the heads of families or clans, and their staffs symbolize their role as shepherds of their people. This act underscores the importance of leadership and accountability within the community.<p><b>Write each man&#8217;s name on his staff</b><br>Writing the name on each staff personalizes the object, linking it directly to the individual leader and his tribe. This act of inscription serves as a form of identification and ownership, ensuring clarity and preventing disputes. It also foreshadows the personal relationship God desires with each of His people, as seen in <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>, where believers are promised a new name known only to them and God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to guide His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

No tribe is left out, preventing later claims of favoritism (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>- The use of ordinary wooden staffs highlights that any miraculous outcome must be credited to God alone, not to some special human craftsmanship (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one from the leader of each tribe</b><p>- Leadership is front-and-center: &#8220;one from the leader of each tribe.&#8221; The confrontation is not with the rank-and-file but with the very heads who had questioned Aaron&#8217;s priesthood (<a href="/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a>).<p>- God graciously gives these leaders a tangible opportunity to submit to His choice instead of their own ambitions (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>- The principle of representative testing mirrors earlier events, such as the twelve spies (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2&#8211;3</a>), where each tribe&#8217;s fate was tied to its leader&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Write each man&#8217;s name on his staff</b><p>- Inscribing the names eliminates any confusion about which staff belongs to whom, making the forthcoming miracle unmistakable (<a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>).<p>- It personalizes accountability: every chief will see God&#8217;s verdict on his own leadership claim (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6</a>).<p>- Names signify covenant identity; God has a pattern of writing names to affirm belonging or judgment&#8212;e.g., engraving the tribes on the high priest&#8217;s breastpiece (<a href="/exodus/28-21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>) and Christ&#8217;s promise to write the overcomer&#8217;s name on Him (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2</a> sets up a decisive, God-ordained test to silence rebellion and confirm His chosen priesthood.

It is also used in the sense of "tribe" (<a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4, 16</a>). Each tribe was but a branch, or rod, out of the stock of Israel, and, therefore, was most naturally represented by the rod cut from the tree. 'The words used for scepter in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, and in <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, and for rod in <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, and elsewhere are different, but the same imagery underlies the use of all of them. <span class="cmt_word">Of all</span> <span class="cmt_word">their princes... twelve rods.</span> These princes must be those named in chapter 2 and 7. Since among these are to be found the tribe princes of Ephraim and Manasseh, standing upon a perfect equality with the rest, it is evident that the twelve rods were exclusive of that of Aaron. The joining together of Ephraim and Manasseh in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> was a very different thing, because it could not raise any question as between the two. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;
