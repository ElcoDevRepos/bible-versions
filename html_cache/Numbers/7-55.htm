The silver platter, weighing 130 shekels, was a significant gift, reflecting the wealth and devotion of the tribe. The use of silver, a precious metal, underscores the value placed on worship and dedication to God. The weight of the platter, measured in shekels, aligns with the ancient Near Eastern practice of using standardized weights for trade and offerings, ensuring fairness and consistency in religious practices.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, weighing 70 shekels, complements the platter, indicating a complete and generous offering. The bowl's purpose was likely for holding the grain offering, symbolizing sustenance and provision. The specific weight again highlights the importance of precision and adherence to divine instructions in worship. This offering reflects the communal responsibility and participation in the religious life of Israel, as each tribe contributed equally to the dedication of the altar.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The mention of the "sanctuary shekel" indicates a standardized weight used specifically for religious purposes, distinct from common commercial weights. This standardization ensured that offerings were made with integrity and uniformity, reflecting the holiness and orderliness required in worship. The sanctuary shekel was likely heavier than the common shekel, emphasizing the sacredness of the offerings made to God.<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, was a common sacrificial offering in the Israelite religious system. Fine flour represents purity and the best of one's produce, while oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit and anointing. This offering was a non-blood sacrifice, signifying thanksgiving, dedication, and fellowship with God. It points to the sustenance provided by God and the worshiper's dependence on Him. The grain offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, offering spiritual nourishment and sustenance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abidan.htm">Abidan</a></b><br>He was the leader of the tribe of Benjamin during the time of the wilderness wanderings.
