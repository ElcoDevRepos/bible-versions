It is significant in the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. The congregation's contention here reflects a recurring theme of Israel's complaints and lack of faith during their wilderness wanderings. This incident is part of a broader narrative of testing and rebellion against God, which is a central theme in the Pentateuch.<p><b>both of you rebelled against My command</b><br>This phrase refers to Moses and Aaron, who were leaders of the Israelites. Their rebellion is detailed in <a href="/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7-12</a>, where God instructed Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water, but instead, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff. This act of disobedience is seen as a failure to uphold God's holiness and a lack of trust in His provision. It highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands, especially for those in leadership.<p><b>to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.&#8221;</b><br>God's holiness is a central theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing His separateness, purity, and divine nature. In this context, Moses and Aaron's failure to follow God's instructions prevented the demonstration of His holiness to the Israelites. The incident underscores the importance of leaders reflecting God's character and the consequences of failing to do so.<p><b>Those were the waters of Meribah in Kadesh,</b><br>Meribah, meaning "quarreling" or "strife," is a location associated with the Israelites' complaints and God's provision of water. Kadesh is a significant site in the wilderness journey, serving as a base for the Israelites. The naming of Meribah serves as a reminder of the people's contentious nature and the testing of God's patience.<p><b>in the Wilderness of Zin.</b><br>The repetition of the location emphasizes the geographical and historical context of the event. The Wilderness of Zin is a harsh, arid environment, which contributed to the Israelites' struggles and complaints. This setting serves as a backdrop for God's miraculous provision and the testing of faith. The wilderness experience is often seen as a metaphor for spiritual testing and growth in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses instead strikes the rock twice and speaks harshly to the people (20:10-11).<p>&#8226; Aaron, as high priest beside him, shares the accountability; leadership in God&#8217;s house is always collective (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a> clarifies the charge: &#8220;You broke faith with Me.&#8221; The act was overt disobedience, not a minor misstep.
