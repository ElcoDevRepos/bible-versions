The Amorites were a powerful Canaanite tribe, and their defeat marked a crucial step in Israel's journey to the Promised Land. This victory fulfilled God's promise to give the land of the Amorites into Israel's hands (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). The conquest of these cities demonstrated God's faithfulness and power, as well as His judgment against the Amorites for their iniquity. The victory also served as a precursor to the larger conquests in Canaan, showcasing God's provision and guidance.<p><b>and occupied them</b><br>The occupation of the Amorite cities signifies a transition from nomadic life to settlement, a key development in Israel's history. This occupation was not just a military achievement but also a fulfillment of God's covenant promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It symbolizes the beginning of Israel's establishment as a nation in a land of their own, foreshadowing the eventual settlement in Canaan. The occupation also involved the Israelites taking over existing infrastructure, which would have been a strategic advantage.<p><b>including Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was a significant city, previously the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites. Its capture was a notable victory, as it was a fortified city and a center of power. The city is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, indicating its continued importance in the region. The capture of Heshbon demonstrated the weakening of Amorite power and the strategic advantage gained by Israel. It also served as a testament to God's deliverance and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>and all its villages</b><br>The mention of villages indicates the comprehensive nature of Israel's conquest. It wasn't just the major cities that were captured, but also the surrounding smaller settlements. This thorough conquest ensured control over the entire region, preventing any resurgence of Amorite power. The inclusion of villages highlights the extent of the land now under Israelite control, emphasizing the completeness of God's provision. It also reflects the transition from a wandering people to a settled nation, as they began to inhabit and cultivate the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Jacob, who are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in Canaan, known for their opposition to Israel.
