The term "LORD's assembly" emphasizes their covenant relationship with Yahweh, who delivered them from Egypt. This question is directed at Moses and Aaron, highlighting their role as leaders. The assembly's complaint echoes previous instances of grumbling (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>), showing a recurring pattern of doubt and lack of faith in God's provision.<p><b>into this wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents both a physical and spiritual testing ground. Geographically, the Israelites are in the Desert of Zin, a harsh and arid region. Spiritually, the wilderness is a place of trial and dependence on God, reminiscent of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). The wilderness journey is a formative period for Israel, intended to teach reliance on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p><b>for us and our livestock to die here?</b><br>This phrase underscores the desperation and fear of the Israelites, who are concerned for their survival and that of their livestock, essential for their livelihood. Historically, livestock were vital for food, clothing, and sacrifices. The question implies a lack of trust in God's promise to bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate consequence of unbelief, as many in this generation would not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>). This complaint can be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, where He faced death in obedience to God's will, contrasting the Israelites' fear of death due to lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, responsible for guiding them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are expressing their frustration and lack of faith in God's provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_zin.htm">The Wilderness of Zin</a></b><br>A desolate area where the Israelites are camped, highlighting their physical and spiritual challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_assembly.htm">The LORD&#8217;s Assembly</a></b><br>Refers to the congregation of Israel, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_complaint.htm">The Event of Complaint</a></b><br>The Israelites' grumbling against Moses and Aaron due to the lack of water, reflecting a recurring theme of doubt and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Despite the challenging circumstances, believers are called to trust in God's faithfulness and provision, just as the Israelites were expected to do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complaining.htm">The Danger of Complaining</a></b><br>Complaining can lead to a hardened heart and a lack of faith.

<a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41-42</a> notes that Israel &#8220;again and again tempted God,&#8221; reminding us that unbelief often comes wrapped in accusatory language.<p>&#8226; Their question shows misplaced blame: God had brought them, yet they accuse Moses, revealing hearts hardened by years of miraculous provision taken for granted (<a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD&#8217;s assembly</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Assembly&#8221; highlights corporate identity; they are not a random crowd but the covenant community redeemed by blood (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13, 51</a>).<p>&#8226; To speak as though God&#8217;s people could be abandoned insults the very name of the LORD who calls them His &#8220;treasured possession&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a> recalls this same &#8220;assembly in the wilderness,&#8221; underscoring continuity between the gathered nation and Christ&#8217;s Church: both exist only because God gathers and sustains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into this wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The wilderness of Zin (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>) is real desert&#8212;arid, hostile, unable to support life without divine intervention (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God did not stumble into this terrain; He led them there to teach dependence, as Moses later explains: &#8220;that He might humble you and test you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226;

The fear of death dominates their outlook, despite having escaped Pharaoh&#8217;s death decree and plague (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3</a> records the same pessimistic forecast after the spy report; decades later, the refrain remains unchanged, proving that unbelief can outlive an entire generation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jude 5 warns believers today not to mirror those who were &#8220;destroyed because they did not believe.&#8221; Physical death in the desert became a vivid consequence of spiritual rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/20-4.htm">Numbers 20:4</a> captures a moment when God&#8217;s redeemed people, faced with fresh hardship, reinterpret His faithful leading as reckless abandonment. Each phrase exposes a layer of unbelief: questioning God&#8217;s motives, forgetting their privileged identity, resenting His chosen path, prioritizing temporal security, and assuming the worst outcome. The verse stands as a sober reminder that grumbling is not a trivial complaint but a direct challenge to the character of the God who unfailingly provides for His own. Trusting His proven faithfulness turns the wilderness from a graveyard of doubt into a training ground for deeper obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why have ye brought up</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness?</span> These words are almost exactly repeated from <a href="/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>. They, and those which follow, are no doubt out of place if considered as expressing the feelings of the great bulk of the people, who had no knowledge of Egypt, and had grown up in the wilderness. But on such occasions it is always the few who put words into the months of the many, and the ringleaders in this gainsaying would naturally be the survivors of the elder generation, whose dis. position was exactly the same as ever, and who had always shown a remarkable want of originality in their complaints. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
