Coriander seed is small, round, and typically yellowish-brown, suggesting that manna was similarly small and round. This description emphasizes the everyday nature of God's provision, using a familiar plant to convey the appearance of something divine. The comparison to coriander seed also highlights the simplicity and humility of God's provision, contrasting with the Israelites' complaints about their diet. This can be seen as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the sufficiency of His provision, even when it does not meet human expectations. The manna is a type of Christ, who is the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), providing spiritual sustenance.<p><b>and its appearance was like that of gum resin</b><br>The appearance of manna is likened to gum resin, which is typically translucent and can vary in color. This description suggests that manna had a glistening or shiny quality, perhaps indicating its purity and divine origin. Gum resin, such as myrrh or frankincense, was often used in ancient times for incense and anointing oils, symbolizing holiness and consecration. This connection may imply that manna, as a divine gift, was set apart and sacred. The comparison to gum resin also underscores the miraculous nature of manna, as it was unlike any natural food known to the Israelites. This miraculous provision points to God's ability to sustain His people in unexpected ways and foreshadows the miraculous provision of Jesus Christ, who sustains believers spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is responsible for guiding them through the wilderness and interceding on their behalf with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land, experiencing God's provision and testing in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous food provided by God to sustain the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.

The dissatisfaction of the Israelites with the sweet bread of heaven, and their craving after the more savoury and more stimulating food of Egypt may be regarded as typical of man's natural repugnance to the spiritual food which is provided in the Gospel, and his restless cravings after the pleasures of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The manna was as coriander seed.</span> On the name and the nature of the manna see <a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>. It is commonly supposed that the brief description here inserted was intended to show the unreasonableness of the popular complaints. There is no trace whatever of any such purpose. So far as the description conveys fresh information, it was simply suggested by the occurrence of the word "manna," according to the artless style of the narrative. If any moral purpose must be assigned to this digression, it would rather be to suggest that the people had some real temptation to complain. It is often forgotten that, although the manna was supernatural, at least as to the amount and regularity of its supply, yet as an article of food it contained no supernatural elements. If we had to live upon nothing but cakes flavored with honey or with olive oil, it is certain that we should soon find them pall upon our appetite. To the eye of the Psalmist the manna appeared as angels' food (<a href="/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>); but then the Psalmist had not lived on manna every day for a year. We have to remember, in this as in many other cases, that the Israelites would not be "our ensamples" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>) if they had not succumbed to real temptations. As the colour of bdellium. See on Genesis 2:12. As no one knows anything at all about bdellium, this adds nothing to our knowledge of the manna. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the appearance of ice," or perhaps "of hoar-frost." As it translates bdellium in <a href="/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> (carbuncle), it is probable that the comparison to ice here is due to some tradition about the manna. Taking this passage in connection with <a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>, we may reasonably conjecture that it was of an opalescent white, the same colour probably which is mentioned in connection with manna in <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the manna</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
