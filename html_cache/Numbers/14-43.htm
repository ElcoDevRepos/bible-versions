The Amalekites, descendants of Esau, were known for their guerrilla warfare tactics and had previously attacked the Israelites at Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). The Canaanites, inhabitants of the Promised Land, were known for their fortified cities and military strength. This phrase indicates the immediate threat posed by these groups, emphasizing the danger of proceeding without divine guidance. Historically, these peoples were entrenched in the land, making any attempt to conquer it without God's help a perilous endeavor.<p><b>and you will fall by the sword</b><br>This phrase is a direct warning of the consequences of disobedience. The Israelites' lack of faith and rebellion against God's command to enter the Promised Land would lead to their defeat. The "sword" symbolizes military defeat and death, a common fate for those who opposed God's will. This serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience and trust in God's promises, as seen in other biblical narratives where disobedience led to downfall (e.g., Saul's disobedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>).<p><b>Because you have turned away from the LORD</b><br>Turning away from the LORD signifies a breach in the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This phrase highlights the spiritual rebellion of the Israelites, who doubted God's promise and power despite witnessing His miracles. Biblically, turning away from God often results in losing His protection and blessings, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption throughout the book of Judges. This turning away is a heart issue, reflecting a lack of faith and trust in God's plan.<p><b>He will not be with you</b><br>The absence of God's presence is a severe consequence for Israel. Throughout the Old Testament, God's presence is synonymous with guidance, protection, and victory. Without it, the Israelites are vulnerable to their enemies. This phrase underscores the conditional nature of God's covenant with Israel, where His presence is contingent upon their faithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of God's presence through the Holy Spirit for believers who remain in Christ (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe known for their hostility towards Israel.
