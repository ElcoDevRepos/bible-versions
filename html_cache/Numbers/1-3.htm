Moses, as the prophet and leader, and Aaron, as the high priest, are responsible for organizing the people. This census is not merely a counting but a divinely ordained task, highlighting the importance of order and structure in the community of Israel. The act of numbering signifies preparation and readiness, often seen in military contexts throughout the Bible.<p><b>those who are twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty is significant as it marks the transition into adulthood and eligibility for military service. This age requirement underscores the importance of maturity and responsibility in serving the nation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, this age was commonly associated with the ability to bear arms and participate in communal defense. The age of twenty is also mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/exodus/30-14.htm">Exodus 30:14</a>, where it is the age for contributing to the sanctuary.<p><b>by their divisions</b><br>The term "divisions" refers to the organization of the tribes into military units. This structure is crucial for maintaining order and efficiency in both military and community life. The division of the tribes into units reflects the broader theme of orderliness found throughout the Pentateuch, where God establishes systems and hierarchies for the functioning of His people. This organization is mirrored in the New Testament, where the Church is described as a body with many parts, each with its own function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>everyone who can serve in Israel&#8217;s army</b><br>This phrase highlights the primary purpose of the census: to prepare for military engagement. The Israelites are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, and readiness for battle is essential. The concept of serving in the army is tied to the idea of being part of God's covenant people, who are called to defend and uphold His promises. This military service is not just a civic duty but a spiritual one, as the battles they face are seen as part of God's divine plan. The theme of spiritual warfare is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The verse teaches that leadership is accountable, service is age-qualified, organization matters, and every believer has a role in advancing God&#8217;s purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">From twenty years old and upward.</span>--The result of the previous numbering (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-26.htm" title="A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.">Exodus 38:26</a>), which was made about six months earlier, and which was probably obtained by counting the number of half-shekels which were paid, as Ithamar appears to have done (<a href="/exodus/38-2.htm" title="And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.">Exodus 38:2</a>), exactly corresponds with the result of the present census (<a href="/numbers/1-46.htm" title="Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.">Numbers 1:46</a>). But the complete census, or numbering and enrolment of the persons according to tribes, families, and fathers' houses, appears to have been deferred until after the erection of the tabernacle, towards the construction of which the atonement money had been paid. If the whole was done in obedience to the command contained in <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>, and was regarded as one transaction, those only would be numbered on the second occasion who had already paid their atonement money. There is nothing impossible in the supposition that the whole of those who had been numbered six months previously were still alive, but no allowance is made, on this supposition, for the number of those who were below twenty years of age at the earlier period, and who had exceeded that age at the later period. Inasmuch, however, as the sum-total in both cases is divisible by ten, and inasmuch as the separate items in this chapter are given in tens (the smallest subdivision of the people which was adopted by Moses, on the recommendation of Jethro, <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm" title="Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:">Exodus 18:21</a>), no objection to the historical accuracy of both records can be sustained if it be allowed that the number of those who had attained the age of twenty years since the earlier census corresponded nearly with the number of deaths during the same period. The whole of the objection, however, is removed in a far more satisfactory manner by the supposition that there was only one census.
