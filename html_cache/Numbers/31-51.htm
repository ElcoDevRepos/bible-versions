Moses represents the lawgiver and leader, while Eleazar, the son of Aaron, represents the priestly line. Their joint action signifies the unity of civil and religious authority in Israel. This collaboration underscores the importance of both leadership and priesthood in the community's spiritual and social life. The act of receiving indicates a formal and recognized transfer of goods, which is significant in the context of offerings and dedications to God. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and accountability before God.<p><b>all the articles made out of gold.</b><br>The articles made of gold refer to the spoils of war taken from the Midianites, as described earlier in the chapter. Gold, a precious metal, often symbolizes purity, value, and divinity in the Bible. The collection of gold articles can be seen as a form of tribute or offering to God, acknowledging His role in their victory. This act of dedicating spoils to God is consistent with the practice of giving the firstfruits or a portion of one's gains to the Lord, as seen in other parts of Scripture. The use of gold in the tabernacle and later in the temple also points to its significance in worship and the presence of God. This foreshadows the ultimate offering of Jesus Christ, who is described as more precious than gold, and whose sacrifice fulfills the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
