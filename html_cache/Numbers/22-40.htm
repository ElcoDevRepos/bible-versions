Sacrifices were often made to seek favor from deities, to atone for sins, or to celebrate significant events. Balak, the king of Moab, is engaging in a ritual that would have been familiar to both his people and the Israelites. The use of cattle and sheep is significant, as these animals were considered valuable and were often used in sacrificial offerings. This act indicates Balak's earnestness in seeking divine intervention against Israel. The practice of animal sacrifice is also seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in Leviticus, where God provides specific instructions for offerings.<p><b>and he gave portions to Balaam</b><br>In ancient sacrificial rituals, it was customary to distribute portions of the sacrifice to those involved in the ceremony. By giving portions to Balaam, Balak is not only honoring him but also attempting to secure his services as a prophet. Balaam, though not an Israelite, is recognized as a prophet with the power to bless or curse, which Balak hopes to use against the Israelites. This act of giving portions can be seen as a form of payment or inducement, reflecting the cultural practices of the time where prophets or seers were often compensated for their services. This mirrors the biblical principle that "the worker deserves his wages" (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>).<p><b>and the princes who were with him</b><br>The mention of princes indicates that Balak was not acting alone but had the support of Moabite leaders. These princes likely represented the political and military leadership of Moab, emphasizing the seriousness of the threat perceived from the Israelites. Their presence underscores the collective effort to influence Balaam's prophecy. This gathering of leaders can be compared to other instances in the Bible where leaders come together to make significant decisions, such as the council of elders in Israel. The involvement of these princes also highlights the political nature of the situation, as the Moabites sought to protect their land and people from the advancing Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless or curse, hired by Balak to curse Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes_of_moab.htm">Princes of Moab</a></b><br>The officials or leaders accompanying Balak, representing Moab's interests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The act of offering cattle and sheep, which in this context is a gesture of hospitality and an attempt to gain favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, and historically an adversary of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_opposing_god's_will.htm">The Futility of Opposing God's Will</a></b><br>Balak's sacrifices, though significant, could not alter God's plan for Israel.

Balak&#8217;s act mirrors that pattern&#8212;seeking supernatural aid against Israel.<p>&#8226; Though Balak served pagan gods, Scripture still records the act without approving it, emphasizing that people instinctively recognize the need to honor a higher power when facing fear (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The costly offering highlights how far Moab&#8217;s king would go to oppose God&#8217;s people&#8212;foreshadowing the futility of resisting the LORD (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he gave portions to Balaam</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and he gave portions to Balaam&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-40.htm">Numbers 22:40</a>)<p>&#8226; Sharing the sacrificial meal was customary, symbolizing fellowship and contracting favor (<a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-23.htm">1 Samuel 9:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Balak treats Balaam as his hired spiritual specialist, reinforcing the transactional mindset that a curse could be bought (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam accepts the food, showing his willingness to engage&#8212;even though he has already declared he can only speak what God permits (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>; 23:26). The tension builds between divine sovereignty and human scheming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the princes who were with him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the princes who were with him.&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-40.htm">Numbers 22:40</a>)<p>&#8226; Balak extends hospitality to his Moabite and Midianite officials (<a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>,7). This public banquet reinforces political unity against Israel (<a href="/psalms/83-2.htm">Psalm 83:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Eating together ratifies their shared purpose, much like covenants sealed by meals in <a href="/genesis/26-30.htm">Genesis 26:30 and 31</a>:54.<p>&#8226; By including the princes, Balak ensures witnesses to the arrangement with Balaam, attempting to bind the prophet socially and politically to their cause (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>). Yet their combined authority cannot override God&#8217;s word (<a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Balak&#8217;s sacrifices, shared portions with Balaam, and the involvement of Moabite princes form a calculated strategy: secure divine power, purchase prophetic services, and unify leadership against Israel.

Indeed the known fact that Beldam was a prophet of the Lord was no doubt one of Balak's chief reasons for wishing to obtain his services. Balak shared the common opinion of antiquity, that the various national deities were enabled by circumstances past human understanding to do sometimes more, sometimes less, for their special votaries. He perceived that the God of Israel was likely, as things stood, to carry all before him; but he thought that he might by judicious management be won over, at least to some extent, to desert the cause of Israel and to favour that of Moab. To this end he "retained" at great cost the services of Balaam, the prophet of the Lord, and to this end he was willing to offer any number of sacrifices. Even the resolute and self-reliant Romans believed in the wisdom of such a policy. Thus Pliny quotes ancient authors as affirming "in oppugnationibus ante omnia solitum a Romanis sacrdotibus evocari Deum, cujus in tutela id oppidum esset, promittique illi eundem aut ampliorem apud Romanos cultum," and he adds, "durat in Pontificum disciplina id sacrum, constatque ideo occultatum, in cujus Dei tutela Roma esset, ne qui hostium simili modo agerent." And sent, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, portions of the sacrificial meats. <p> CHAPTER 22:41; 23, 24 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Balak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;l&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1111.htm">Strong's 1111: </a> </span><span class="str2">Balak -- 'devastator', a Moabite king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sacrificed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiz&#183;ba&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
