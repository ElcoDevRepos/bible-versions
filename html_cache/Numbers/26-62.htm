The number 23,000 reflects a census taken of the Levites, emphasizing their role and importance in the religious life of Israel. This count is significant as it shows the growth and stability of the tribe dedicated to priestly duties. The Levites were responsible for the tabernacle and later the temple services, which were central to Israelite worship. This number also indicates God's provision and blessing upon the tribe, ensuring they were numerous enough to fulfill their duties.<p><b>every male a month old or more</b><br>Unlike the other tribes, where the census typically counted males from twenty years old and upward, the Levites were counted from one month old. This reflects their unique role and dedication to God from birth. It underscores the idea that the Levites were consecrated to God from the earliest stages of life, highlighting the importance of their service and the sacred nature of their calling. This early counting also ensured that the tribe's numbers were accurately represented, considering their role in the community.<p><b>they were not numbered among the other Israelites</b><br>The Levites were set apart from the other tribes, not included in the general census of Israelite men eligible for military service. This separation underscores their distinct role as spiritual leaders and servants in the tabernacle. Their exclusion from the military census highlights their primary responsibility for religious duties rather than warfare. This distinction is a reminder of the different functions within the community of God's people, each with its own purpose and calling.<p><b>because no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites</b><br>The Levites did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, their inheritance was the Lord Himself and the service they performed for Him. This arrangement emphasized their dependence on God and the community's support through tithes and offerings. It also foreshadowed the New Testament teaching that believers' true inheritance is spiritual rather than material. The Levites' unique position points to the idea of living by faith and reliance on God's provision, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and service to God.

Together these truths teach that God values His worshipers, sets them apart for His purposes from the earliest days, and delights to be their ultimate portion&#8212;an assurance for all who serve Him today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(62) <span class= "bld">Twenty and three thousand.--</span>At the former census the number was 22,000 or 22,300 (See <a href="/numbers/3-39.htm" title="All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.">Numbers 3:39</a>, and Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 62.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those that were numbered of them.</span> We have here again a round number (23,000), showing an increase of 1000 since the former census. It is evident that the males of Levi were not counted by anything less than hundreds, and probable that they were counted by thousands (see note on chapter Numbers 3:29). The smallness of the increase in a tribe which was excepted from the general doom at Kadesh, and which in other ways was so favourably situated, seems to point to some considerable losses. It is possible that portions of the tribe suffered severely for their share in the rebellion of Korah; if so, the families of the Shimites and of the Uzzielites may have been so much reduced as to be merged in the remaining families. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/26-62.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The registration [of the Levites]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural construct &#124;
