The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, and they had a complex relationship with Israel, sometimes allies, other times adversaries. In this context, the capture of women and children reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of taking captives after a military victory. This action was part of God's judgment on the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into idolatry and immorality, as seen in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>. The capture of women and children also raises questions about the treatment of captives, which is addressed later in the chapter.<p><b>and they plundered all their herds, flocks, and goods</b><br>Plundering was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving as both a reward for the victors and a means of weakening the enemy. The herds and flocks were valuable assets, providing food, clothing, and economic resources. This act of plundering fulfilled God's command to Moses to execute vengeance on the Midianites (<a href="/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>). The acquisition of goods also signifies the transfer of wealth and resources, which would have been seen as a divine blessing and provision for the Israelites. This event can be compared to other instances in the Bible where God allows His people to take spoils from their enemies, such as the plundering of Egypt during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were led by Moses during this period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe descended from Midian, a son of Abraham by Keturah.
