This reflects the fear and desperation of Balak, as the Israelites had already defeated the Amorites and were seen as a significant threat. The act of seeking a curse from a prophet indicates the belief in the power of spoken words and blessings or curses in the ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>he went out to meet him</b><br>Balak's decision to personally meet Balaam underscores the importance he placed on securing Balaam's services. It was customary for kings to send emissaries, but Balak's personal involvement highlights his anxiety and the high stakes involved. This also shows the respect and recognition Balaam commanded as a prophet.<p><b>at the Moabite city on the Arnon border</b><br>The Arnon River served as a significant geographical boundary, marking the northern border of Moab. This location is strategic, as it was a point of entry into Moabite territory. The mention of the Moabite city suggests a place of significance, possibly a fortified city that served as a defense point against invaders.<p><b>at the edge of his territory</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the territorial concerns of Balak. The Israelites' presence near the border was a direct threat to Moab's security. The edge of the territory signifies a place of vulnerability, where Balak's control was most at risk. This setting also foreshadows the impending spiritual and physical conflict between Moab and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless or curse, summoned by Balak to curse Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A region east of the Dead Sea, whose king, Balak, is concerned about the advancing Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon.htm">Arnon</a></b><br>A river that serves as a border for Moab, marking the edge of Balak's territory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whose presence and success in the region cause fear among neighboring nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, God demonstrates His control over the affairs of nations.

Meeting there kept Balaam close to Israel&#8217;s camp while sparing Balak the embarrassment of hosting him in the royal palace until success was certain.<p>&#8226; The setting underscores the tension: Israel was encamped just across the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>), and any curse pronounced would be almost within earshot.<p>&#8226; Balak positions Balaam where military and spiritual lines converge, hoping proximity will empower the curse (contrast <a href="/numbers/24-5.htm">Numbers 24:5-9</a> where God turns curses into blessings).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the edge of his territory</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights how threatened Moab felt; the king literally stands on the brink of his land, facing what he believes is extinction (<a href="/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often emphasizes boundaries God Himself establishes (<a href="/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). Balak&#8217;s actions inadvertently acknowledge that ultimate control of borders belongs to the Lord.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s presence at the very edge of Moab foreshadows God&#8217;s promise to grant His people the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-31.htm">Deuteronomy 2:31</a>), despite every human attempt to resist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-36.htm">Numbers 22:36</a> pictures a nervous king racing to intercept a mercenary prophet on his frontier.
