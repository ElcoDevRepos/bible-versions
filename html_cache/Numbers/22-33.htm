The donkey's ability to see the angel while Balaam could not highlights the spiritual blindness of Balaam, who was enticed by the promise of wealth from Balak, king of Moab. The number three often signifies completeness or divine intervention in the Bible, as seen in other instances such as Peter's denial of Christ three times (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). The donkey's actions demonstrate God's intervention to prevent Balaam from making a grave mistake, emphasizing the theme of divine protection and guidance.<p><b>If she had not turned away,</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of the donkey's actions in saving Balaam's life. It suggests that God can use any means, even a humble animal, to accomplish His purposes and protect His people. This reflects the biblical theme that God often uses the weak or unexpected to fulfill His plans, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, where God chooses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. The donkey's turning away is a physical manifestation of divine mercy and intervention.<p><b>then by now I would surely have killed you</b><br>The angel's words indicate the seriousness of Balaam's disobedience and the imminent danger he was in. This serves as a warning about the consequences of opposing God's will. The phrase also reflects the justice of God, who does not tolerate rebellion or sin. It is a reminder of the severity of divine judgment, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>and let her live.&#8221;</b><br>The decision to spare the donkey while threatening Balaam's life highlights the innocence and obedience of the animal compared to Balaam's misguided intentions. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where the innocent suffer for the sake of the guilty, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who was without sin yet died for the sins of humanity (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The sparing of the donkey also emphasizes God's compassion and care for all His creation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which speaks of the righteous caring for the needs of their animals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is summoned by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

God opens the eyes of an ordinary beast to reveal an angel with a drawn sword (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>).<p>- Scripture elsewhere shows God enabling sight into the unseen: &#8220;Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>- <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a> recalls this scene to underline how God can use &#8220;a speechless donkey&#8221; to restrain human folly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and turned away from me</b><p>- The donkey&#8217;s reflex is immediate obedience; she steps out of the angel&#8217;s path, modeling the wisdom of avoiding judgment (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>).<p>- Balaam, however, lashes out (<a href="/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23&#8211;27</a>), illustrating how sin resists God&#8217;s warnings.<p>- <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a> echoes the principle: &#8220;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>these three times</b><p>- Repetition heightens urgency and establishes full testimony (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>- Balak later complains that Balaam blessed Israel &#8220;these three times&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>), showing a pattern of God overruling human intent.<p>- Peter&#8217;s threefold denial and restoration (<a href="/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a>; <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>) similarly stress decisive moments that demand repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If she had not turned away</b><p>- God reveals that the donkey&#8217;s detours were acts of mercy.

God employs an animal&#8217;s vision and reflexes to protect a man bent on sin, illustrating His sovereign control, His willingness to warn repeatedly, and the deadly seriousness of resisting His will. The verse invites us to recognize divine roadblocks as mercy, heed God&#8217;s repeated cautions, and embrace prompt obedience&#8212;lest judgment fall where grace has already cleared a path for life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Unless she had turned from me.</span>--There may be an aposiopesis in this verse. <span class= "ital">Perhaps she turned aside from </span>(or, <span class= "ital">before</span>)<span class= "ital"> me </span>. . . <span class= "ital">for </span>(otherwise) <span class= "ital">now I had killed thee, &c. </span>According to this view the angel does not assign a reason why the ass turned aside, but leaves this to be inferred by Balaam.
