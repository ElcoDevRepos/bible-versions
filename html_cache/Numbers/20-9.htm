It represents God's provision and guidance for Israel.<p><b>from the LORD&#8217;s presence</b><br>The phrase indicates the sacredness of the staff, which was kept in the presence of the LORD, likely in the Tabernacle. This setting underscores the holiness and divine origin of the instructions given to Moses. The Tabernacle was the dwelling place of God among His people, signifying His continual presence and covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>just as he had been commanded</b><br>This highlights Moses' obedience to God's instructions, a recurring theme in his leadership. Obedience to God's commands is a central tenet in the narrative of Israel's journey. However, in the broader context of <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>, Moses' later actions deviate from God's command, leading to significant consequences. This phrase emphasizes the importance of following God's word precisely, a principle echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.
