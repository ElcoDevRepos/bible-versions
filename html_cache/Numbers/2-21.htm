Scripture treats the tribe as a distinct military unit, a &#8220;division,&#8221; not a loose crowd (<a href="/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>; 10:14).<p>&#8226; God positions this division on the west side of the camp under the banner of Ephraim (<a href="/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18&#8211;24</a>). Like spokes around a hub, every tribe circles the tabernacle, demonstrating that worship, not human preference, determines placement (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Order is intentional. When the nation breaks camp, Manasseh will march in the exact slot assigned (<a href="/numbers/10-22.htm">Numbers 10:22&#8211;24</a>), illustrating that God is &#8220;not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Because each division has a named leader, responsibility is personal. The scene anticipates New-Covenant teaching that believers serve under Christ&#8217;s headship with identifiable gifts and tasks (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b><a href="/bsb/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>,200</b><p>&#8226; The figure repeats the census taken one month earlier (<a href="/numbers/1-34.htm">Numbers 1:34&#8211;35</a>). Only men twenty years old and upward, &#8220;all who could serve in the army,&#8221; are counted. The book underscores that God knows His people individually and corporately (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>; <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; At 32,200, Manasseh is the smallest of the three western tribes, yet the record gives the same precision shown to larger tribes like Judah (<a href="/numbers/2-4.htm">Numbers 2:4</a>). In God&#8217;s economy, size never determines worth (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The number highlights readiness. These men will soon face battle on the journey to Canaan (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21&#8211;24</a>). The Lord equips every tribe&#8212;large or small&#8212;for the fights ordained for them (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, during the second census, Manasseh grows dramatically to 52,700 (<a href="/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a>), proving that obedience and divine blessing, not initial strength, shape a tribe&#8217;s future (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Added to Ephraim&#8217;s 40,500 (<a href="/numbers/2-19.htm">Numbers 2:19</a>) and Benjamin&#8217;s 35,400 (<a href="/numbers/2-23.htm">Numbers 2:23</a>), Manasseh helps form a west-side total of 108,100 soldiers. The balanced arrangement guards the tabernacle on every side and foreshadows the New Jerusalem, where equal measurements reflect perfect security (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21</a>, though brief, teaches that God numbers and orders His people with exact care. &#8220;His division&#8221; tells us Manasseh has a distinct, honored place; &#8220;32,200&#8221; assures us every individual is known and valued. Together the words reveal a God who combines precision with purpose, preparing even the smallest group for meaningful service in His unfolding plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and his division</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">numbers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">32,200</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1447;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;na&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - md<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/2-21.htm">Numbers 2:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/2-21.htm">OT Law: Numbers 2:21 His division and those who were numbered (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/2-20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 2:20"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 2:20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/2-22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 2:22"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 2:22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
