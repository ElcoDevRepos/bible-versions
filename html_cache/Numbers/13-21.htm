The act of spying out the land was a strategic move, reflecting the military and exploratory practices of ancient Near Eastern cultures. It demonstrates the Israelites' preparation and caution before entering the Promised Land. This mission was commanded by God (<a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13:1-2</a>), showing divine involvement in their journey. The act of sending spies can also be seen as a test of faith for the Israelites, as they were to trust in God's promise despite the challenges they might observe.<p><b>from the Wilderness of Zin</b><br>The Wilderness of Zin is a desert region located in the southern part of Canaan, near the Negev. It served as a boundary for the land of Edom (<a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-4</a>). This area is significant in the Israelites' journey, as it represents the transition from wandering in the wilderness to entering the land promised to them by God. The wilderness experience is often seen as a time of testing and reliance on God, paralleling the Christian journey of faith and dependence on divine guidance.<p><b>as far as Rehob</b><br>Rehob is identified as a northern boundary of the land the spies explored. It is associated with the region near modern-day Lebanon. The mention of Rehob indicates the extensive scope of the land the Israelites were to inherit, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham about the vastness of the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This exploration underscores the abundance and diversity of the Promised Land, which was to be a place of blessing and prosperity for God's people.<p><b>toward Lebo-hamath</b><br>Lebo-hamath is a location marking the northern extent of the land of Canaan. It is often associated with the entrance to the region of Hamath, a significant city-state in ancient Syria. This reference highlights the strategic and fertile nature of the land, as Hamath was known for its wealth and resources. The inclusion of Lebo-hamath in the spies' journey emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel a land stretching from the desert to the fertile regions of the north, symbolizing God's provision and the future establishment of Israel as a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_zin.htm">Wilderness of Zin</a></b><br>A desert region in the southern part of Canaan, marking the starting point of the spies' exploration.
