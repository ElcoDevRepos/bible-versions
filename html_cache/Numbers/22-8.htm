This phrase suggests a pause for reflection and consultation, highlighting the importance of seeking divine guidance before making decisions. It also sets the stage for Balaam's interaction with God, emphasizing the need for patience and discernment in spiritual matters.<p><b>Balaam replied,</b><br>Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is a complex figure in the biblical narrative. His role as a diviner is acknowledged, yet his actions and motivations are scrutinized throughout the story. This phrase introduces Balaam's response, which is pivotal in understanding his character and the unfolding events. His reply reflects his awareness of the spiritual realm and his willingness to engage with the divine, despite his later actions that reveal conflicting loyalties.<p><b>and I will give you the answer that the LORD speaks to me.</b><br>Balaam's statement underscores the importance of divine revelation in decision-making. The use of "the LORD" (Yahweh) indicates that Balaam recognizes the God of Israel as the ultimate authority, despite his pagan background. This phrase highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and the necessity of aligning human actions with divine will. It also foreshadows the tension between Balaam's desire for personal gain and his obligation to convey God's message accurately.<p><b>So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</b><br>The presence of the Moabite princes signifies the political and spiritual stakes involved in Balaam's decision. Moab, a neighboring nation of Israel, sought to curse Israel through Balaam, reflecting the historical enmity between the two peoples. This phrase illustrates the intersection of political intrigue and spiritual warfare, as the Moabite leaders await a pronouncement that could alter the balance of power. It also serves as a reminder of the broader narrative of God's protection over Israel, despite external threats.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless and curse.
