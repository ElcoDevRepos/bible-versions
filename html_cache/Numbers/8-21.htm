This act of purification involved rituals that symbolized spiritual cleansing and dedication to God&#8217;s service. The Levites were set apart for the work of the Lord, and their purification was a physical representation of their spiritual readiness. This mirrors the New Testament call for believers to be spiritually pure and set apart for God's work (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and washed their clothes</b><br>Washing clothes was a common practice for ritual purification in ancient Israel, symbolizing the removal of impurity and sin. This act is reminiscent of the instructions given to the Israelites at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>) and signifies a fresh start and readiness to serve. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of being clothed in righteousness (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>).<p><b>and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD</b><br>The wave offering was a symbolic act of presenting something to God and then receiving it back for use. Aaron, as the high priest, acted as a mediator between God and the Levites, presenting them to the Lord for His service. This act signifies the dedication of the Levites to God&#8217;s work, similar to how believers are called to present themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them</b><br>Atonement was necessary for the Levites to be cleansed from sin and to be fit for service. Aaron, as the high priest, performed this act, which involved sacrifices that pointed to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ. This highlights the necessity of atonement for sin and the role of the priest as an intercessor, prefiguring Christ&#8217;s role as our High Priest who makes atonement for us (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
