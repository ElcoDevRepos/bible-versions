In the ancient Near East, sorcery and spells were common practices used to curse or harm enemies. However, God&#8217;s covenant with Jacob (Israel) ensures that no magical or spiritual force can prevail against them. This reflects God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where He declares that He will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse them. The protection is not due to Israel's own strength but because of God's sovereign will and His faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>and no divination against Israel.</b><br>Divination was a practice used to seek knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means. In the context of <a href="/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23</a>, Balaam, a prophet hired by Balak, king of Moab, attempts to curse Israel through divination. However, God intervenes, demonstrating His control over all spiritual realms and His commitment to Israel's welfare. This phrase underscores the futility of any attempt to use divination against God's chosen people. It also highlights the theme of God's omnipotence and His ability to thwart human plans, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, where it is stated that no weapon formed against God's people will prosper.<p><b>It will now be said of Jacob and Israel,</b><br>This anticipates a future recognition of God's mighty works on behalf of Israel. The repetition of "Jacob" and "Israel" emphasizes the continuity of God's promises from the patriarch Jacob to the nation of Israel. It suggests a testimony that will be acknowledged by others, reflecting the idea that God's actions on behalf of His people will be so evident that they will be spoken of widely. This is reminiscent of the Exodus narrative, where God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt became known among the nations (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>).<p><b>&#8216;What great things God has done!&#8217;</b><br>This exclamation points to the miraculous and mighty acts of God in the history of Israel. It is a declaration of praise and recognition of God's intervention and blessings. The phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/126-3.htm">Psalm 126:3</a>, where the psalmist declares, "The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy." It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to Israel and extends God's blessings to all nations. This acknowledgment of God's deeds serves as a reminder of His faithfulness and the assurance that His purposes will be accomplished.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet hired by Balak to curse Israel.

"What is here affirmed of Israel," says Hengstenberg, "applies to the Church of all ages, and also to every individual believer. The Church of God knows from His own Word what God does, and what it has to do in consequence. The wisdom of this world resembles augury and divination. The Church of God, which is in possession of His word, has no need of it."
