The use of gold in offerings reflects the value and honor given to God. In biblical times, gold was associated with royalty and deity, as seen in the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p><b>weighing ten shekels</b><br>A shekel was a standard unit of weight in ancient Israel, approximately 11.4 grams or 0.4 ounces. The specific weight of ten shekels indicates a precise and intentional offering, reflecting the importance of order and obedience in worship. This precision is mirrored in the detailed instructions given for the construction of the tabernacle (Exodus 25-31).<p><b>filled with incense</b><br>Incense was a significant element in Israelite worship, symbolizing prayers ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The use of incense in offerings highlights the importance of prayer and intercession. Incense was also part of the daily rituals in the tabernacle, representing a continual offering before God. The sweet aroma of incense can be seen as a type of Christ, whose sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in the wilderness, receiving instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings and sacrifices are made.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leaders_of_israel.htm">The Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>Representatives from each tribe who bring offerings for the dedication of the altar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The sacred place where offerings are made to God, symbolizing His presence and the people's devotion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/incense.htm">Incense</a></b><br>A fragrant substance used in worship, symbolizing prayers and the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_offerings.htm">The Significance of Offerings</a></b><br>Offerings in the Old Testament were a tangible expression of devotion and obedience to God.

The phrase &#8220;one gold dish&#8221; highlights both unity and value. Gold speaks of purity and honor in worship (<a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a>), and a single dish for each leader underscores that no tribe was above another in approaching God. The tabernacle table already held golden dishes for the bread of the Presence (<a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>), so this new dish aligned with established worship patterns. By bringing what God prescribed, Abidan of Benjamin showed submission to divine order, mirroring the heart attitude later praised in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>: &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>weighing ten shekels</b><p>The specific weight matters. A shekel was a standardized measure (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>), ensuring that each leader&#8217;s gift met the same exacting standard. Ten often signals completeness&#8212;think of the Ten Commandments&#8212;but here it simply records a literal, measurable weight that met God&#8217;s requirements. Uniform weight kept the focus on obedience rather than competition, reflecting the balanced scales God loves (<a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>). By listing the weight, Scripture reminds us that God notices the details of our giving (<a href="/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>filled with incense</b><p>Incense in Scripture symbolizes the prayers of God&#8217;s people rising before Him (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). The dish was not left empty; it was &#8220;filled,&#8221; showing that worship is not merely about valuable objects but about fragrant devotion. The formulation of incense was holy and unique to the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). Bringing a full measure signified wholehearted participation in the covenant, anticipating the High Priest&#8217;s ministry on the Day of Atonement when incense filled the Most Holy Place (<a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>). The fragrance points us forward to Christ, whose intercession continually rises on our behalf (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62</a> records an actual, tangible gift&#8212;&#8220;one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense&#8221;&#8212;yet each detail carries enduring meaning. The gold dish shows the worthiness of God, the fixed weight underscores obedient precision, and the incense embodies heartfelt prayer. Together they model worship that is costly, measured by God&#8217;s standard, and overflowing with devotion&#8212;a pattern still relevant for every believer who longs to honor the Lord in spirit and truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-62.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(kap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3709.htm">Strong's 3709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hollow or flat of the hand, palm, sole (of the foot), a pan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">weighing ten [shekels],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6235.htm">Strong's 6235: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">filled with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4392.htm">Strong's 4392: </a> </span><span class="str2">Full, filling, fulness, fully</span><br /><br /><span class="word">incense;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7004.htm">Strong's 7004: </a> </span><span class="str2">Smoke, odor of (burning) sacrifice, incense</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/7-62.htm">Numbers 7:62 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/7-62.htm">OT Law: Numbers 7:62 One golden ladle of ten shekels full (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/7-61.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 7:61"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 7:61" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/7-63.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 7:63"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 7:63" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
