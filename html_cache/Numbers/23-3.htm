The burnt offering here signifies an attempt to gain divine attention and favor. Balaam instructs Balak to remain by the offering, indicating the importance of the ritual in seeking a divine encounter. This reflects the belief that sacrifices could facilitate communication with the divine, a concept also seen in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>, where burnt offerings are detailed as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.<p><b>Balaam said to Balak.</b><br>Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is a complex figure who is both a seer and a diviner. His interactions with Balak, the king of Moab, highlight the tension between divine will and human desire. Balak's role as king underscores the political and spiritual stakes involved, as he seeks to curse Israel, whom he perceives as a threat. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where God uses Balaam, despite his intentions, to bless Israel instead.<p><b>Perhaps the LORD will meet with me.</b><br>The use of "perhaps" indicates uncertainty in Balaam's ability to control or predict divine encounters, emphasizing God's sovereignty. The term "LORD" (YHWH) is significant, as it denotes the covenant name of the God of Israel, suggesting that Balaam acknowledges the power and authority of Israel's God, even though he is not an Israelite. This reflects the biblical theme that God can reveal Himself to and through anyone, regardless of their background.<p><b>And whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you.</b><br>Balaam's commitment to relay only what God reveals highlights the prophetic principle of speaking God's truth, regardless of personal or political pressure. This aligns with the biblical standard for true prophecy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>, where a prophet must speak only what God commands. Balaam's statement foreshadows the divine messages he will deliver, which ultimately bless Israel instead of cursing them.<p><b>So Balaam went off to a barren height,</b><br>The "barren height" refers to a high place, often used in ancient times for worship and divination, as it was believed to be closer to the divine realm. This setting underscores the spiritual nature of Balaam's task and the expectation of a divine encounter. High places were common in Canaanite and Israelite worship, though later condemned in Israelite practice (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>). The choice of location reflects the cultural and religious practices of the time, where geography was thought to influence spiritual experiences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is called upon by Balak to curse the Israelites.

Balak, king of Moab, fears Israel&#8217;s numbers and seeks supernatural help. He hires Balaam, a well-known diviner from Mesopotamia (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>). The LORD has already told Balaam not to curse Israel because they are blessed (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>), yet Balaam keeps negotiating, revealing a heart pulled between God&#8217;s word and the lure of Balak&#8217;s reward (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The burnt offering Balak must guard</b><p>&#8226; Balak offers seven bulls and seven rams on seven altars (<a href="/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1-2</a>), a costly display meant to secure divine favor.<p>&#8226; Balaam tells Balak, &#8220;Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone&#8221; (23:3). The sacrifice is left smoldering as a visible plea to God, echoing earlier altar scenes where someone waits beside an offering for God&#8217;s answer (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrangement underscores that no amount of ritual can manipulate God; He will speak as He chooses (<a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Perhaps the LORD will meet with me&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s word &#8220;perhaps&#8221; shows that genuine encounter with the LORD is sovereignly granted, never guaranteed by human effort (<a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This contrasts sharply with pagan divination, which claimed to coerce the gods. Balaam, despite his mixed motives, admits that only the LORD can initiate communication (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates later prophets who wait for God&#8217;s word rather than invent it (<a href="/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18, 22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Commitment to speak only what God reveals</b><p>&#8226; Balaam says, &#8220;Whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>; cf. 22:18; 24:13). On the surface this sounds faithful, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-20</a> that a prophet must relay the divine message unaltered.<p>&#8226; Yet Balaam&#8217;s later counsel that leads Israel into sin (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>) shows how a person can say the right words while harboring a wrong heart, reminding us that obedience must be both verbal and moral (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The barren height</b><p>&#8226; Balaam &#8220;went off to a barren height.&#8221; High places were customary locations for both legitimate and illegitimate worship (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12-14</a>; 1 Kin 3:4).<p>&#8226; The bareness pictures isolation&#8212;no distractions, no human audience&#8212;so the revelation, when it comes, is unmistakably from God (1 Kin 19:11-13).<p>&#8226; In the following verses, God indeed meets Balaam and places words of blessing, not cursing, in his mouth (<a href="/numbers/23-4.htm">Numbers 23:4-12</a>), proving divine sovereignty over every attempted manipulation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take-home truths</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word cannot be bent by sacrifices, money, or human pressure (<a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; An impressive ritual means nothing unless the heart submits to God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Even unlikely instruments&#8212;such as a foreign diviner&#8212;must bow to speak God&#8217;s truth, showcasing His absolute authority (<a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a> records Balaam pausing between the costly sacrifices of Balak and the sovereign voice of the LORD.

It seems clear that it was his practice to do so, either as having some faith himself in such uncertainties, or as stooping to usual heathen arts which he inwardly despised. But from the fact that God met him (we know not how), and that such supernatural communication was not unexpected, we may conclude that Balaam's words meant more for himself than the mere observance of auguries, whatever they may have meant for Balak.
