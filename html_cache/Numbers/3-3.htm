His sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, were chosen to serve alongside him. This lineage is significant as it establishes the hereditary priesthood in Israel, a role that would be passed down through Aaron's descendants. The priesthood was a central institution in Israelite religion, responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the tabernacle. The mention of Aaron's sons highlights the importance of family lineage in the priestly duties, as seen in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, where God commands Moses to bring Aaron and his sons to serve as priests.<p><b>the anointed priests</b><br>Anointing with oil was a symbolic act signifying consecration and setting apart for a holy purpose. In the case of Aaron's sons, it marked their official induction into the priesthood. This practice of anointing is seen throughout the Old Testament, often associated with kings and prophets, indicating divine selection and empowerment. The anointing of priests is detailed in <a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a> and <a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>, where Moses anoints Aaron and his sons, signifying their sanctification for service in the tabernacle. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>who were ordained to serve as priests</b><br>The ordination of Aaron's sons involved a series of rituals, including sacrifices and the wearing of specific garments, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>. This ordination was not merely a ceremonial act but a divine appointment, emphasizing the sacred nature of their duties. The priests served as mediators between God and the people, offering sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the tabernacle. This role is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the mediator of a new covenant, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. The ordination underscores the continuity of God's plan for redemption, with the priesthood serving as a type of Christ's ultimate priestly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
