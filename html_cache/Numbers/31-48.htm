In the context of ancient Israel, the army was structured with a clear hierarchy, reflecting the need for order and discipline in military campaigns. The officers were likely chosen for their leadership skills and experience in battle. This structure is reminiscent of the organization seen in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where Moses appoints leaders over groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, suggesting a consistent approach to leadership and governance.<p><b>the commanders of thousands and of hundreds</b><br>The mention of "commanders of thousands and of hundreds" indicates a well-organized military system. This hierarchical structure allowed for efficient command and control during military operations. The division into thousands and hundreds suggests a scalable and flexible approach to warfare, which was necessary for the various campaigns the Israelites undertook. This system is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>, where similar military divisions are mentioned, highlighting the continuity of military organization in Israel's history.<p><b>approached Moses</b><br>The act of approaching Moses signifies the respect and authority Moses held as the leader of the Israelites. Moses was not only a spiritual leader but also a political and military figure, guiding the people through the wilderness and into the Promised Land. This approach indicates a formal communication, likely involving a report or request, reflecting the chain of command and the importance of Moses' role in decision-making. This interaction underscores Moses' central role in the narrative of the Israelites, as seen throughout the Pentateuch, where he serves as the mediator between God and the people, similar to the role of Christ as the mediator in the New Testament (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Their willingness to step forward underscores accountability: &#8220;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds</b><p>&#8226;
