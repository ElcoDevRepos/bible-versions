The judges of Israel were leaders appointed to maintain order and justice among the tribes. This reflects the theocratic system where civil and religious duties were intertwined. The role of judges here is significant, as it shows the delegation of authority and the importance of leadership in maintaining covenant faithfulness.<p><b>Each of you must kill</b><br>This command reflects the severity of the sin committed by the Israelites. The act of killing was a judicial execution, not murder, emphasizing the seriousness of idolatry and apostasy. It underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity among His people. This harsh measure was intended to prevent the spread of sin and to maintain the sanctity of the community.<p><b>all of his men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor</b><br>Baal of Peor was a local deity worshiped by the Moabites, and the Israelites' participation in this worship was a direct violation of the first commandment. This incident highlights the recurring struggle of Israel with idolatry and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The worship of Baal often involved immoral practices, which were abhorrent to God. This event is a reminder of the constant temptation to compromise faith and the need for vigilance in spiritual matters. Connections can be drawn to other instances of idolatry in Israel's history, such as the golden calf (Exodus 32), and the warnings against idolatry found throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
