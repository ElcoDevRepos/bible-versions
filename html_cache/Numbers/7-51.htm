Bulls were considered valuable livestock, representing strength and wealth. The use of a young bull in offerings is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>, where it is specified for burnt offerings. This offering symbolizes atonement and dedication to God, reflecting the worshiper's desire to be in right standing with Him. The bull's strength and vigor can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offered Himself in the prime of His life.<p><b>one ram</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing leadership and authority. In <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>, a ram is provided by God as a substitute for Isaac, prefiguring Christ's substitutionary atonement. The ram's horns are also significant, often used as trumpets in Israelite culture, such as in the battle of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). The offering of a ram in this context underscores the completeness and sufficiency of the sacrifice, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<p><b>and one male lamb a year old</b><br>The specification of a male lamb a year old is crucial, as it denotes purity and innocence, being without blemish. This mirrors the requirements for the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>, which is a direct foreshadowing of Christ, the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The age of the lamb, being one year old, indicates it is in its prime, symbolizing the perfect and complete nature of the sacrifice. This typology is fulfilled in Jesus, who was sinless and offered Himself willingly.<p><b>for a burnt offering;</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing the worshiper's complete surrender and devotion to God. It was entirely consumed by fire, representing the totality of the offering and the worshiper's commitment. This type of offering is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> and is one of the most common offerings in the Old Testament. The complete consumption by fire signifies the idea of ascending to God, as the smoke rises, symbolizing the prayers and dedication of the people. This offering prefigures Christ's total sacrifice, as He gave Himself wholly for humanity's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions from God regarding the offerings and the dedication of the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in the wilderness, receiving the law and instructions for worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_naphtali.htm">Tribe of Naphtali</a></b><br>The tribe that presented the offerings on the twelfth day, as part of the dedication of the altar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire offering was consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The burnt offering represents total dedication and surrender to God.

The young bull represents the highest value animal in the herd, a costly gift (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; 4:3).<p>&#8226; Such an offering underscored that the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="/numbers/7-42.htm">Numbers 7:42, 47</a>&#8211;51) withheld nothing precious from the LORD, mirroring the way God withholds nothing in providing salvation (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Bulls were also linked with priestly consecration (<a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14&#8211;18</a>) and national atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>), reminding us that sin&#8217;s price is weighty.<p>&#8226; Though animal blood could never fully remove guilt (<a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a>), this sacrifice foreshadowed Christ&#8217;s complete, once-for-all offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One ram</b><p>&#8226; A ram evokes the substitution in <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>, where God provided a ram in Isaac&#8217;s place, picturing substitutionary atonement.<p>&#8226; Rams frequently accompany ordination and fellowship offerings (<a href="/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22</a>; 9:2), signaling strength devoted to God.<p>&#8226; In prophetic vision, restored worship still features a ram for burnt offerings (<a href="/ezekiel/43-23.htm">Ezekiel 43:23</a>), affirming God&#8217;s unchanging pattern of acceptable sacrifice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One male lamb a year old</b><p>&#8226; A year-old male lamb stands at the peak of health and innocence, matching Passover requirements (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Daily burnt offerings used similar lambs (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;4</a>), so including one here ties the tribe&#8217;s unique gift to Israel&#8217;s ongoing worship rhythm.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> identifies Jesus as &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,&#8221; revealing the ultimate reality these lambs anticipated (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For a burnt offering</b><p>&#8226; The burnt offering was wholly consumed by fire (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>), symbolizing total surrender to God&#8212;nothing held back.<p>&#8226; Its aroma was &#8220;pleasing to the LORD,&#8221; portraying acceptance and fellowship (<a href="/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today respond by offering themselves &#8220;as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), made possible because Christ &#8220;was sacrificed once for all&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-51.htm">Numbers 7:51</a> shows Naphtali presenting a young bull, a ram, and a year-old male lamb as a burnt offering. Each animal points to a distinctive facet of consecration&#8212;costly surrender, substitutionary strength, and spotless innocence&#8212;all consumed to declare full devotion to the LORD. Together they anticipate the perfect sacrifice of Christ, who fulfills and surpasses every Old Testament offering, enabling us to live wholly yielded lives before God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1438;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">young</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bull,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6499.htm">Strong's 6499: </a> </span><span class="str2">Young bull, steer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ram,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1447;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_352.htm">Strong's 352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, strong, a chief, a ram, a pilaster, an oak, strong tree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male lamb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1489;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ke&#183;&#7687;e&#347;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3532.htm">Strong's 3532: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a year old,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a burnt offering;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
