Fine flour symbolizes purity and the best of human labor, reflecting the offering of one's best to God. The mixing with oil represents the Holy Spirit's presence and anointing, as oil often symbolizes the Spirit in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This offering was a way for the Israelites to acknowledge God's provision and express gratitude. It also points to Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who was anointed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>offer three-tenths of an ephah with each bull,</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. The specific measurement of three-tenths of an ephah indicates the substantial nature of the offering, reflecting the importance of the bull as a significant sacrifice. Bulls were often used in sacrifices for atonement and dedication, symbolizing strength and leadership. This offering underscores the seriousness of approaching God and the need for a worthy sacrifice, prefiguring Christ's ultimate sacrifice as the perfect offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>two-tenths of an ephah with the ram,</b><br>The ram, often associated with substitutionary sacrifice, as seen in the story of Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), required a slightly smaller grain offering. The two-tenths of an ephah still represent a significant offering, emphasizing the value and importance of the sacrifice. Rams were used in various offerings, including burnt offerings and peace offerings, symbolizing consecration and reconciliation with God. This points to Christ, who is our peace and has reconciled us to God through His sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given these specific instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where these offerings were to be made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices instituted by God for the Israelites, which included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were journeying towards and where these practices would continue.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Understanding the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The sacrificial system was a means for the Israelites to maintain a relationship with God, acknowledging their sin and dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_grain_offering.htm">Symbolism of the Grain Offering</a></b><br>The grain offering, made of fine flour and oil, symbolizes dedication and thanksgiving to God.

Fine flour points to purity&#8212;no chaff, no lumps, simply the best of the harvest (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>). Mixing it with oil kept it from being dry, and throughout Scripture oil pictures the presence and enabling of the Spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). Together they tell a story: God desires worship that is both pure and Spirit-empowered. The grain offering was eaten by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16-18</a>), underscoring fellowship between God and His servants. By requiring this offering on the first day of the Passover week, the Lord wove gratitude for daily provision right into the nation&#8217;s most significant redemption celebration (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Offer three-tenths of an ephah with each bull</b><p>A bull was the costliest animal in Israel&#8217;s herds (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-4</a>). Matching that higher value, the Lord commanded the largest grain measure&#8212;three-tenths of an ephah (about eleven quarts). The proportion teaches:<p>&#8226; Greater blessing calls for greater gratitude (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Abundance is meant to be turned back to God in worship (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10-11</a>).<p>The bull often symbolized strength and leadership, so the sizeable grain portion emphasizes that even the strongest among God&#8217;s people depend entirely on His daily provision (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-15</a>). Each bull&#8217;s accompanying grain offering declared, &#8220;All I possess, even my strength, comes from You.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two-tenths of an ephah with the ram</b><p>Stepping down to a ram, the grain measure also steps down&#8212;yet not by half, only by a third (<a href="/numbers/15-6.htm">Numbers 15:6</a>). The Lord never reduces worship to a token gesture.<p>&#8226; A ram was used for fellowship offerings (<a href="/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a>) and consecration (<a href="/exodus/29-19.htm">Exodus 29:19-22</a>); pairing it with two-tenths of fine flour reminded Israel that fellowship and consecration require ongoing sustenance from God.<p>&#8226; The smaller but still generous portion shows God values willing hearts more than sheer volume (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p>Even lesser sacrifices were not second-class; they still carried rich symbolism pointing forward to the ultimate, once-for-all offering of Christ, whose perfect life fulfilled every type and shadow (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/28-20.htm">Numbers 28:20</a> teaches that every level of worship&#8212;whether involving a costly bull or a lesser ram&#8212;must be accompanied by a wholehearted, Spirit-empowered acknowledgment of God&#8217;s provision. Fine flour signals purity, oil signifies the Spirit, and the measured portions call each worshiper to respond proportionately to God&#8217;s goodness. The passage invites believers today to bring the best, mix it with reliance on the Spirit, and offer it gratefully to the One who supplies all things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/28-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The grain offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1448;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
