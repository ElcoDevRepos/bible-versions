This directive is a divine response to the spiritual and moral corruption that threatened the covenant community. The Midianites, though related to the Israelites through Abraham (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>), had become adversaries by leading Israel into sin. This attack is not merely a military action but a divine judgment against those who sought to undermine God's people. The Midianites are often associated with nomadic tribes in the region, and their influence extended into Moabite territory, as seen in the alliance against Israel.<p><b>and strike them dead.</b><br>The phrase "strike them dead" underscores the severity of the judgment. This is not a call for indiscriminate violence but a specific judgment against those who have led Israel into sin. The execution of this command is seen later in <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, where Moses sends a force to carry out this divine directive. The complete destruction of the Midianites involved the death of their kings and the prophet Balaam, who had counseled Balak to use the Midianite women to seduce the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8, 16</a>). This act of judgment serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of leading God's people into sin and the seriousness with which God protects His covenant relationship.

God&#8217;s people were not to stand idle while sin and idolatry threatened their covenant relationship. The verb reminds us that faith sometimes requires confronting evil, not merely avoiding it (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Midianites</b><p>Midian had lured Israel into idolatry and immorality through the counsel of Balaam and the seduction of Midianite women (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3, 6</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>). This was not random aggression but judgment on a specific nation that had actively sought Israel&#8217;s downfall (<a href="/numbers/31-1.htm">Numbers 31:1-2</a>).

As the descendants of Abraham, the father of the faithful, the Midianites ought to have feared and obeyed Abraham's God, and to have shown brotherly kindness to His people, who were their own kindred. The special judgments of God are directed against the sins of apostacy and of seduction. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-6.htm" title="Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double to her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled fill to her double.">Revelation 18:6</a>.) Although the Moabites were not to be smitten with the Midianites (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>), nevertheless they did not escape punishment, but were shut out, even to the tenth generation, from the congregation of the Lord. (See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-3.htm" title="An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>.) Their exemption at this time from the judgment executed upon the Midianites was probably due, not to their descent from Lot (for the Midianites were descended from Abraham), but to the fact that the measure of their sin was not yet full. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vex</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Midianites.</span> The Moabites, although the evil began with them, were passed over; perhaps because they were still protected by the Divine injunction (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>) not to meddle with them; more probably because their sin had not the same studied and deliberate character as the sin of the Midianites. We may think of the women of Moab as merely indulging their individual passions after their wonted manner, but of the women of Midian as employed by their rulers, on the advice of Balsam, in a deliberate plot to entangle the Israelites in heathen rites and heathen sins which would alienate from them the favour of God. <span class="ref_word">NOTE ON THE ZEAL OF PHINEHAS.</span> The act of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, in slaying Zimri and Cozbi is one of the most memorable in the Old Testament; not so much, however, in itself, as in the commendation bestowed upon it by God. It is unquestionably surprising at first sight that an act of unauthorized zeal, which might so readily be made (as indeed it was made) the excuse for deeds of murderous fanaticism, should be commended in the strongest terms by the Almighty; that an act of summary vengeance, which we find it somewhat hard to justify on moral grounds, should be made in a peculiar sense and in a special degree the pattern of the great atonement wrought by the Saviour of mankind; but this aspect of the deed in the <span class="accented">eyes</span> of God by its very unexpectedness draws our attention to it, and obliges us to consider wherein its distinctive religious character and excellence lay. It is necessary in the first place to point out that the act of Phinehas did really receive stronger testimony from God than any other act done <span class="accented">proprio motu</span> in the Old Testament. What he did was not done officially (for he held no office), nor was it clone by command (for the offenders were not under his jurisdiction as judge), nor in fulfillment of any revealed law or duty (for no blame would have attached to him if he had let it alone), and yet it had the same effect in staying the plague as the act of Aaron when he stood between the living and the dead with the hallowed fire in his hand (see on Numbers 16:46-48). Of both it is said that <span class="accented">"he</span> made an atonement for the people," and so far they both appear as having power with God to turn away his wrath and stay his avenging hand. But the atonement made by Aaron was official, for he was the anointed high priest, and, being made with incense from the sanctuary, it was mate in accordance with and upon the strength of a ceremonial law laid down by God whereby he had bound himself to exercise his Divine right of pardon. The act of Phinehas, on the contrary, had no legal or ritual value; there is no power of atonement in the blood of sinners, nor had the death of 24,000 guilty people had any effect in turning away the wrath of God from them that survived. It remains, therefore, a startling truth that the deed of Phinehas is the only act neither official nor commanded, but originating in the impulses of the actor himself, to which the power of atoning for sin is ascribed in the Old Testament: for although in <a href="/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a> David speaks of making an atonement by giving up seven of Saul's sons, it is evident from the context that the "atonement" was made to the Gibeonites, and not directly to the Lord. Again, the act of Phinehas merited the highest reward from God, a reward which was promised to him in the most absolute terms. Because he had clone this thing he should have God's covenant of peace, he and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. This promise must mean that he and his seed should have power with God for ever to make peace between heaven and earth, and to make reconciliation for the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people; and, meaning this, it is a republication in favour of Phinehas, and in more absolute terms, of the covenant made with Levi as represented by Aaron (see on Malachi 2:4, 5). Nor is this all. In <a href="/psalms/106-31.htm">Psalm 106:31</a> it is said of his deed that "it was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore." This word "counted" or "imputed" is the same (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) which is used of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, and the very words of the Septuagint here (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) are applied to the obedience of Abraham in <a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. It appears then that righteousness was imputed to Phinehas, as to the father of the faithful, with this distinction, that to Phinehas it was imputed as an everlasting righteousness, which is not said of Abraham. Now if we compare the two, it must be evident that the act of Phinehas was not, like Abraham's, an act of self-sacrificing obedience, nor in any special sense an act of faith. While both acted under the sense of duty, the following of duty in Abraham's case put the greatest possible strain upon all the natural impulses of mind and heart; in the case of Phinehas it altogether coincided with the impulses of his own will. If faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, it is clear that zeal was imputed to Phinehas for righteousness for evermore. This being so, it is necessary in the second place to point out that the act in question (like that of Abraham in sacrificing his son) was distinctly one of moral virtue according to the standard then Divinely allowed. An act which was in itself wrong, or of doubtful rectitude, could not form the ground for such praise and promise, even supposing that they really looked far beyond the act itself. Now it is clear <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that under no circumstances would a similar act be justifiable now; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that no precedent could be established by it then. <p>The Jews indeed feigned a "zealot-right," examples of which they saw (amongst others) in the act of Samuel slaying Agag (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>), of Mattathias slaying the idolatrous Jew and the king's commissioner (1 Macc. 2:24-26), of the Sanhedrim slaying St. Stephen. But the last-mentioned case is evidence enough that in the absence of distinct Divine guidance zeal is sure to degenerate into fanaticism, or rather that it is impossible to distinguish zeal from fanaticism. Every such act must of necessity stand upon its own merits, for it can only be justified by the coexistence of two conditions which are alike beyond human certainty:  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/25-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Attack</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6887.htm">Strong's 6887: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind, tie up, be restricted, narrow, scant, or cramped</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Midianites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;y&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4084.htm">Strong's 4084: </a> </span><span class="str2">Midianite -- a descendant of Midian</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and strike them dead.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hik&#183;k&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/25-17.htm">OT Law: Numbers 25:17 Harass the Midianites and strike them (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/25-16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 25:16"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 25:16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/25-18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 25:18"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 25:18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
