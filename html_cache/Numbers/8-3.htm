This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, emphasizing the importance of following divine instructions precisely. Aaron's role as high priest is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, perfectly obedient to the Father.<p><b>he set up the lamps facing toward the front of the lampstand,</b><br>The lampstand, or menorah, was a critical element in the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's light and presence among His people. The lamps facing forward ensured that the light illuminated the area in front of the lampstand, representing the guidance and revelation of God. This act of setting up the lamps can be seen as a precursor to Jesus, the Light of the World, who illuminates the path for believers.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority of God's commands and the necessity of adherence to His instructions. Moses, as the mediator of God's covenant, received direct revelation from God, which he conveyed to the Israelites. The obedience of Aaron to Moses' instructions reflects the broader theme of submission to God's will, a principle that is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament teachings of Christ and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
