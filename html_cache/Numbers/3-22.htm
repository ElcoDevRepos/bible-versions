The age of one month is significant as it marks the time when a male child was considered viable and part of the community. This census differs from others in Israel, which typically counted males from twenty years old and upward for military purposes (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). The focus here is on service in the tabernacle, not military duty, highlighting the unique role of the Levites as set apart for religious duties. This early age count underscores the dedication of the Levites to God from infancy, reflecting the principle of being consecrated to God from birth, similar to the Nazarite vow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>).<p><b>was 7,500</b><br>The specific number of 7,500 males in the Gershonite clan reflects the detailed record-keeping and organization of the Israelite community. This number is part of the larger census of the Levites, who were divided into three main families: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. The Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and entrance hangings (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>). The precision of this number demonstrates the importance of each clan's role in the service of the tabernacle, ensuring that every aspect of worship and transport was meticulously managed. This attention to detail in the census reflects God's order and structure within His chosen people, emphasizing the value of each individual in fulfilling His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gershonites.htm">The Gershonites</a></b><br>This verse refers to the Gershonites, one of the Levitical families.

The statement &#8220;The number&#8230;&#8221; shows that the tally was not Moses&#8217; idea but a divine directive, echoing earlier counts such as <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents counting as an act of stewardship&#8212;recognizing that every life belongs to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This figure forms part of the total Levite census that ultimately matched and redeemed the firstborn of Israel (<a href="/numbers/3-39.htm">Numbers 3:39-45</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s precision in keeping covenant promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of all the males</b><p>&#8226; Only males were listed because the tabernacle duties, from guarding the sanctuary to handling heavy curtains and poles, were assigned to men (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the phrase &#8220;of all the males&#8221; reminds us of corporate responsibility. Even those too young to serve were included, showing that God had a place and purpose for every son born into the Gershon family line (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The male-exclusive census anticipates New Testament language that all believers, male and female alike, become a &#8220;royal priesthood&#8221; in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), revealing how temporary distinctions pointed to a fuller future reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a month old or more</b><p>&#8226; Unlike Israel&#8217;s military census that began at age twenty (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>), this Levitical count started at one month&#8212;right after the period of vulnerability recognized in <a href="/leviticus/27-6.htm">Leviticus 27:6</a>.<p>&#8226; Setting the threshold so low ensured every potential servant was registered under God&#8217;s watchful care from infancy (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical wisdom is evident: the Levites would later be substituted one-for-one for Israel&#8217;s firstborn males (<a href="/numbers/3-40.htm">Numbers 3:40-41</a>). Counting from one month guaranteed a true replacement for every firstborn, who likewise belonged to the Lord from birth (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was 7,500</b><p>&#8226; The Gershonite total sits between the Merarites&#8217; 6,200 and the Kohathites&#8217; 8,600 (<a href="/numbers/3-28.htm">Numbers 3:28, 34</a>). God apportioned responsibilities in proportion to clan size: the Gershonites cared for the tabernacle&#8217;s fabrics&#8212;curtains, coverings, and screens (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; 7,500 reveals God&#8217;s orderly provision. No task was left understaffed, and no clan was overloaded. The precise number also strengthens historical reliability; arbitrary or symbolic figures would not fit the detailed breakdown that follows.<p>&#8226; Centuries later, David organized the Levites again, using similar clan totals for temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6-11</a>), showing ongoing trust in God&#8217;s original census.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-22.htm">Numbers 3:22</a> records that &#8220;The number of all the males a month old or more was 7,500&#8221;. Each phrase highlights God&#8217;s intentional design: He counts His people, assigns roles, safeguards the youngest, and provides exactly the workforce needed. Far from a dry statistic, the verse showcases divine faithfulness and precision, inviting us to rest in the same meticulous care the Lord still gives His covenant family today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The number</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural construct &#124;
