This report was not just a factual account but was influenced by fear and disbelief. The "bad report" contrasts with God's earlier assurances of the land's goodness (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This moment is pivotal as it leads to the Israelites' rebellion and subsequent 40 years of wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>).<p><b>The land we explored devours its inhabitants:</b><br>This phrase suggests a perception of danger and hostility in the land, possibly due to its challenging terrain or fierce inhabitants. The hyperbolic language indicates the spies' fear and exaggeration. Historically, Canaan was known for its fortified cities and warrior cultures, which could have contributed to this perception. Theologically, this reflects a lack of faith in God's power to overcome obstacles, contrasting with the faith of Caleb and Joshua (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>).<p><b>And all the people we saw there are great in stature:</b><br>The mention of the inhabitants' size likely refers to the Anakim, a race of giants mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a>. This description serves to amplify the fear and intimidation felt by the spies. Theologically, it highlights the Israelites' focus on human strength rather than divine power. This fear of giants is later addressed in David's encounter with Goliath, where faith in God triumphs over physical might (1 Samuel 17).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, were sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan.
