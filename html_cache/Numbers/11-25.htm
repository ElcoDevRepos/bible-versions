The cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence and guidance, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, where the Lord led the Israelites by a pillar of cloud by day. The cloud signifies divine authority and holiness, separating the sacred from the profane. God's communication with Moses underscores Moses' unique role as a mediator between God and the Israelites, reminiscent of the divine encounters at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>).<p><b>and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses</b><br>The Spirit here refers to the Holy Spirit, who empowered Moses for leadership. This act of taking some of the Spirit signifies the sharing of divine empowerment and wisdom necessary for governance. It reflects the Old Testament understanding of the Spirit's selective and task-oriented presence, unlike the New Testament's more universal indwelling of believers (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders</b><br>The seventy elders represent the leadership structure established to assist Moses, echoing the advice of Jethro in <a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-26</a>. This distribution of the Spirit signifies the delegation of authority and responsibility, ensuring that the burden of leadership is shared. The number seventy may symbolize completeness and is often associated with governance, as seen in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council.<p><b>As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied</b><br>The act of prophesying here serves as a sign of the Spirit's presence and empowerment. Prophecy in the Old Testament often involved speaking God's truth and guidance, not just foretelling the future. This temporary prophetic activity validated the elders' divine appointment and equipped them for their leadership roles, similar to the Spirit's empowerment of Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>.<p><b>but they never did so again</b><br>This phrase indicates the temporary nature of the prophetic sign, emphasizing that the Spirit's empowerment was for a specific purpose and time. It highlights the unique and ongoing prophetic role of Moses, distinguishing him from the elders. This temporary empowerment contrasts with the New Testament promise of the Spirit's continual presence in believers (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>), pointing to the progressive revelation of God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who intervenes directly in the affairs of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, through whom God communicates His will and who is the primary recipient of God's Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventy_elders.htm">The Seventy Elders</a></b><br>Chosen leaders among the Israelites who were endowed with the Spirit to assist Moses in leading the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud.htm">The Cloud</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence, often used in the Old Testament to signify His glory and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophesying.htm">Prophesying</a></b><br>The act of speaking under divine inspiration, which the seventy elders did as a sign of the Spirit's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_presence.htm">The Importance of God's Presence</a></b><br>God's presence, symbolized by the cloud, is essential for guidance and leadership.

Though the prophetic sign is temporary, the Spirit&#8217;s abiding presence equips them for lasting service, illustrating that God meets human need through shared, Spirit-filled leadership without diminishing His power in any servant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">In a cloud.--</span>Hebrew, <span class= "ital">In the cloud.</span><p><span class= "bld">And gave it unto . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">and put it upon, </span>as in <a href="/leviticus/2-15.htm" title="And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.">Leviticus 2:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">They prophesied, and did not cease.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">they prophesied, but did so no more. </span>Comp. <a href="/genesis/8-12.htm" title="And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.">Genesis 8:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/11-6.htm" title="And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.">Exodus 11:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm" title="So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.">2Samuel 2:28</a>; so the LXX.

At other times this cloud dwelt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) above the tabernacle, soaring steadily above it in the clear air; but on certain occasions, for greater impressiveness, the cloud came down and filled the tabernacle, or at any rate the entrance of it, while Moses stood without (cf. <a href="/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5</a> and <a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Took of the spirit which was upon him.</span> Not certainly in anger, or by way of diminishing the fullness of the spirit which was in Moses, but in order that the seventy might participate, and be known to participate, in a gift originally and specially given to Moses. The whole intention of the ceremonial was to declare in the most unmistakable way that the gifts of the seventy were to be exercised only in union with and in subordination to the mediator of Israel. The Targums are substantially correct in their paraphrase: "The Lord made <span class="accented">enlargement</span> of the spirit that was upon him, and imparted to the seventy men, the eiders." Theodoret very happily observes on this passage, "Just as a man who kindles a thousand flames from one does not lessen the first in communicating light to the others, so God did not diminish the grace imparted to Moses by the fact that he communicated of it to the seventy." <span class="cmt_word">They</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophesied.</span> The phenomenon here mentioned for the first time was no doubt an ecstatic utterance, not exactly beyond the control, but certainly beyond the origination, of those who prophesied. It must not be confounded with that state of calm, spiritual exaltation in which such men as Isaac and Jacob spake concerning things to come (<a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>). The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> means literally "were caused to pour forth," and the fundamental idea is that those affected became for the time being vents for the audible utterance of thoughts and expressions which were not theirs, but the Holy Ghost's. Compare the thought in <a href="/job/32-18.htm">Job 32:18-20</a>, and the case of Saul and his messengers, as above. As to the matter of these prophesyings, we may probably conclude that they were of the same nature as the ecstatic utterances of the tongues on the day of Pentecost and afterwards; not "prophecy" in the ordinary sense, but inspired glorification of God, and declaration of his wonderful works (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">did not cease.</span> Rather, "did not add," or "repeat." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>.

The ecstatic utterance did not continue or reappear. The New Testament history no doubt supplies us with the explanation of this. The supernatural sign thus accorded was of little use in itself, and was of much danger, because it attracted to its exhibition an attention which was rather due to more inward and spiritual things. As a sign it was sufficient that it should be once unmistakably manifested before all the people. (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-8.htm">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). The permanent <span class="accented">charisma</span> of the Holy Spirit which the seventy received and retained from this time forth was no doubt the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>;
