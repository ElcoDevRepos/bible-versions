The name Kemuel means "God has raised" or "God's helper," which reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society where leaders were often seen as divinely appointed. Shiphtan, his father, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating that he may not have been a prominent figure outside of this context. The naming of individuals in genealogies and leadership roles underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite culture, where family ties often determined one's role and status within the community.<p><b>a leader from the tribe of Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim was one of the two sons of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim became one of the most prominent tribes in Israel. The tribe held significant influence, often representing the northern kingdom of Israel in later biblical history. Ephraim's central location in the land of Canaan made it a key player in the political and military affairs of the nation. The mention of a leader from Ephraim in this context highlights the tribe's importance in the division and allocation of the Promised Land. This allocation was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it was crucial for maintaining the tribal identities and inheritances as outlined in earlier scriptures. The leadership role of Ephraim also foreshadows its future prominence, as seen in prophecies and narratives throughout the Old Testament, where Ephraim often symbolizes the northern tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kemuel.htm">Kemuel</a></b><br>A leader from the tribe of Ephraim, chosen to help divide the land of Canaan among the Israelites.
