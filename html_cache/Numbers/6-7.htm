The vow required abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with dead bodies, and not cutting one's hair. The inclusion of close family members in this prohibition underscores the seriousness of the vow. In ancient Israel, family ties were paramount, and caring for deceased relatives was a significant duty. This requirement emphasizes the Nazirite's total dedication to God, even above familial obligations. This mirrors the call to prioritize God above all else, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, where Jesus speaks of loving Him more than family.<p><b>he is not to defile himself</b><br>Contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>). For a Nazirite, maintaining ritual purity was essential, as their vow was a public declaration of holiness and separation unto God. This requirement reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God's people are called to be set apart (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The Nazirite vow serves as a tangible expression of this call to holiness, illustrating the need for purity in one's relationship with God.<p><b>because the symbol of consecration to his God is upon his head</b><br>The "symbol of consecration" refers to the uncut hair of the Nazirite, which served as a visible sign of their vow. This outward symbol represented an inward commitment to God, much like other biblical symbols such as circumcision or baptism. The hair was a constant reminder of the Nazirite's dedication and separation unto the Lord. This concept of consecration is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The Nazirite's uncut hair can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was wholly consecrated to God and fulfilled the ultimate vow of dedication through His life and sacrificial death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who takes a special vow of consecration to God, which includes abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with dead bodies, and not cutting their hair.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father,_mother,_brother,_sister.htm">Father, Mother, Brother, Sister</a></b><br>Immediate family members mentioned in the context of mourning and defilement, highlighting the personal cost of the Nazirite vow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crown_of_consecration.htm">Crown of Consecration</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Nazirite's dedication and separation unto God, representing holiness and commitment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/defilement.htm">Defilement</a></b><br>The act of becoming ceremonially unclean, particularly through contact with a dead body, which is prohibited for Nazirites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate focus of the Nazirite vow, emphasizing a life set apart for divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow underscores the importance of living a life set apart for God.

The point is not disdain for family but supreme loyalty to God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> affirms the same: love for Christ must surpass love for parents and children. Whenever God sets someone apart for His service, the call may supersede even the most sacred earthly ties.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is not to defile himself</b><p>Contact with a corpse produced ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-12</a>). For a Nazarite, such defilement would break the vow and require a reset (<a href="/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The command protects uninterrupted worship; impurity would bar the Nazarite from the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This anticipates the New Testament call to believers: &#8220;Therefore come out from among them and be separate&#8230;Touch no unclean thing&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). God still desires a people unstained by sin&#8217;s contamination.<p>&#8226; The refusal to defile himself, even at great personal cost, models wholehearted obedience&#8212;choosing God&#8217;s standard over cultural expectations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the symbol of consecration to his God is upon his head</b><p>The uncut hair signified the vow (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). It was an outward banner of an inward commitment.<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s story illustrates the link between hair and consecration: &#8220;A razor has never come upon my head&#8230;because I have been a Nazirite to God&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>). When the hair was shaved, the visible sign&#8212;and the strength tied to obedience&#8212;departed.<p>&#8226; Consecration &#8220;to his God&#8221; highlights personal ownership: this is the Nazarite&#8217;s God, not a distant deity. The relationship fuels the restriction.<p>&#8226; Believers today carry a parallel mark&#8212;not on the head but in the heart: we are a &#8220;royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God&#8217;s own possession&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Our conduct must reflect that identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a> teaches that the Nazarite&#8217;s devotion to God outranks even the deepest family obligations. Avoiding corpse-defilement safeguards unbroken fellowship, because the visible token of consecration&#8212;the uncut hair&#8212;rests on the Nazarite&#8217;s head. The passage calls every follower of Christ to prize holiness above cultural norms, to remain spiritually clean, and to live in a way that unmistakably proclaims belonging to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">He shall not make himself unclean . . . --</span>The law of the Nazirite in this respect was equally stringent with that of the high priest (<a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm" title="Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;">Leviticus 21:11</a>), and more stringent than that which was imposed upon the priests generally (<a href="/context/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The consecration.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the separation </span>(Hebrew, <span class= "ital">nezer</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>So also in <a href="/numbers/6-9.htm" title="And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.">Numbers 6:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother.</span> The same injunction had been given to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>) - "for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him." A similar reason restrained the Nazirite. <span class="cmt_word">Because the consecration of his God is upon his head,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.,<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> because he wears the unshorn locks which are the outward sign of his separation unto God.

This may have had some foundation in fact, but the true explanation of the three rules is rather to be found in the spiritual truth they teach in a simple and forcible way. He who has a holy ambition to please God must <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> devote to God the whole forces of his being, undiminished by any wont and use of the world; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> abstain not only from pleasures which are actually dangerous, but from such as have any savour of moral evil about them;
