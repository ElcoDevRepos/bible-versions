The censer, a vessel used for burning incense, symbolizes the priestly duties and the sacredness of approaching God. This act was a test to determine whom God had chosen as His true priests. The use of censers highlights the seriousness of the rebellion, as it involved sacred rituals reserved for the priesthood.<p><b>place incense in it</b><br>Incense in the Old Testament is often associated with prayer and worship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, where prayer is likened to incense. The act of placing incense in the censer signifies an attempt to offer worship and seek divine approval. However, in this context, it underscores the presumption of Korah's group in assuming a role not appointed to them by God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of obedience to God's established order.<p><b>and present it before the LORD</b><br>Presenting the censers before the LORD indicates coming into God's presence, a privilege and responsibility given to the priests. This phrase emphasizes the direct challenge to God's authority, as Korah and his followers sought to present themselves as equals to Aaron. The presence of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, where God's holiness and the proper way to approach Him are central. This act of presenting the censers was a direct confrontation with God's chosen leadership.<p><b>250 censers</b><br>The number 250 signifies the large following Korah had amassed, indicating a significant rebellion against Moses and Aaron. This number also highlights the widespread discontent among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The collective action of these men with their censers represents a unified front in their challenge, yet it also sets the stage for God's decisive judgment, as seen later in the chapter.<p><b>You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.</b><br>Moses' instruction for Aaron to present his censer alongside the rebels serves to contrast the divinely appointed priesthood with the presumptuous claims of Korah's group. Aaron's participation underscores his legitimate role as high priest, chosen by God. This act foreshadows the ultimate vindication of Aaron's priesthood, as God demonstrates His choice through the miraculous events that follow. The inclusion of Aaron in this test points to the theme of divine election and the importance of adhering to God's established order, a principle that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Reubenites who joined Korah in his rebellion, questioning Moses' leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the appointed high priest, representing the legitimate priesthood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_250_leaders.htm">The 250 Leaders</a></b><br>Influential community leaders who sided with Korah in the rebellion, each bringing a censer to present before the LORD.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the censers were to be presented.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rebellion.htm">The Danger of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God's appointed leaders is ultimately rebellion against God Himself.

every one of the 250 leaders must act for himself, underscoring individual accountability before God (cf. <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>- A censer was a small fire pan used in priestly service (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1&#8211;9</a>), reminding the men that they are stepping into sacred territory.<p>- Moses does not bar them from approaching; instead he lets the LORD&#8217;s own verdict settle the dispute (<a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>).<p>- Like Nadab and Abihu, who presumptuously used their censers and were judged (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>), these men will learn that nearness to God demands reverence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>place incense in it</b><p>- Incense represents worshipful prayer rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>;

points to the Tabernacle entrance where God&#8217;s glory dwells (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>- The sheer number&#8212;250&#8212;signals organized rebellion, not mere discontent (<a href="/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a>).<p>- By appearing together, they hope to sway God by majority; instead they will meet His unchanging standard (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>- Their censers will later be hammered into plating for the altar as a warning sign (<a href="/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38&#8211;40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You and Aaron are to present your censers as well</b><p>- Moses and Aaron join the test, confident in God&#8217;s prior call (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>).<p>- The inclusion of Aaron, the ordained high priest, sets the divine benchmark against which the impostors will be measured (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11&#8211;14</a>).<p>- The scene mirrors Elijah&#8217;s contest on Mount Carmel: let God answer by fire (<a href="/1_kings/18-24.htm">1 Kings 18:24</a>).<p>- The outcome will vindicate God&#8217;s chosen mediators and preserve the purity of worship (<a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-17.htm">Numbers 16:17</a> records Moses&#8217; Spirit-led challenge to Korah&#8217;s faction: each man must bring his own censer, load it with incense, and stand before the LORD alongside Moses and Aaron. The verse stresses personal accountability, the sanctity of true priestly ministry, and God&#8217;s sovereign right to decide who may approach Him. The subsequent judgment proves that worship is acceptable only when offered through God&#8217;s appointed mediator, foreshadowing the exclusive priesthood of Christ for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Take every man his censer.--</span>These censers may have been household vessels resembling censers, and available for the same purpose;
