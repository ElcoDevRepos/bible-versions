"My glory" can be understood as the visible manifestation of God's presence, such as the pillar of cloud and fire that guided the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The glory of God was also evident at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>). This highlights the seriousness of their unbelief, as they had direct evidence of God's power and presence.<p><b>and the signs I performed in Egypt</b><br>The signs in Egypt refer to the ten plagues that God brought upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites (Exodus 7-12). These miraculous events demonstrated God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods and His power to deliver His people. The plagues were both a judgment on Egypt and a sign of God's covenant faithfulness to Israel.<p><b>and in the wilderness</b><br>In the wilderness, God continued to perform signs, such as providing manna (Exodus 16), water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), and victory over enemies (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>). These miracles were meant to build the Israelites' faith and trust in God as their provider and protector. The wilderness journey was a time of testing and preparation for entering the Promised Land.<p><b>yet have tested Me</b><br>Testing God refers to the Israelites' repeated lack of faith and trust in Him, despite witnessing His miracles. This testing is seen in their complaints and rebellions, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the grumbling for food and water (Numbers 11, 20). Testing God is a serious offense, as it shows a lack of belief in His promises and power.<p><b>and disobeyed Me</b><br>Disobedience to God is a recurring theme in the wilderness narrative. The Israelites' failure to trust and obey God led to various consequences, including the delay in entering the Promised Land. Disobedience is often linked to a lack of faith, as seen in the refusal to enter Canaan due to fear of the inhabitants (Numbers 13-14). Obedience is a key aspect of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>these ten times</b><br>The "ten times" likely refers to specific instances of rebellion and testing, though the exact list is not detailed in the text. It symbolizes a complete and repeated pattern of disobedience. This number may be symbolic, representing fullness or completeness, similar to the ten plagues in Egypt. It underscores the persistent nature of Israel's unbelief and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.
