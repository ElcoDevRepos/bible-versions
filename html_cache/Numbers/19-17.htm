The unclean person here refers to someone who has come into contact with a dead body, which was considered a major source of impurity. This purification process underscores the importance of holiness and separation from death, which is seen as the ultimate consequence of sin. The concept of purification is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be cleansed from sin through the blood of Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<p><b>take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering</b><br>The ashes mentioned are from a red heifer, a unique sacrifice described earlier in <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>. The red heifer was to be without blemish and never yoked, symbolizing purity and submission. The burning of the heifer outside the camp and the collection of its ashes signify the removal of sin and impurity. This ritual prefigures Christ's sacrifice, as He was crucified outside the city (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), and His atoning work cleanses believers from sin.<p><b>put them in a jar</b><br>The use of a jar to contain the ashes indicates the need for careful handling and preservation of the elements used in the purification process. This reflects the sacredness of the ritual and the seriousness with which God views sin and its consequences. The jar serves as a vessel for the means of purification, much like how the body of Christ was the vessel for the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>and pour fresh water over them</b><br>Fresh water, or "living water," symbolizes life, renewal, and the Holy Spirit in biblical literature. The combination of ashes and water creates a purification mixture that cleanses the unclean person. This act points to the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit, who renews and purifies believers (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>). The use of water in this ritual also foreshadows Christian baptism, which signifies the washing away of sin and the believer's new life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who received the laws and instructions for purification.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites who conveyed God's laws and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_heifer.htm">The Red Heifer</a></b><br>A special sacrificial animal whose ashes were used for purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where sacrifices and rituals were performed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_person.htm">The Unclean Person</a></b><br>An individual who had become ceremonially unclean and required purification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity.htm">The Importance of Purity</a></b><br>God values both physical and spiritual purity.
