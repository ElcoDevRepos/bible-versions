It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a jar of manna. The Kohathites, a Levitical clan, were responsible for its care, emphasizing the holiness and reverence required in handling sacred objects. The Ark prefigures Christ as the embodiment of God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>the table</b><br>This refers to the Table of Showbread, which held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and fellowship with Israel. The table was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, signifying purity and divinity. The bread is a type of Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who sustains and nourishes believers.<p><b>the lampstand</b><br>The golden lampstand, or menorah, provided light in the holy place, representing God's guidance and the light of His truth. It was crafted from a single piece of gold, illustrating unity and perfection. The lampstand points to Jesus as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), illuminating the path to God.<p><b>the altars</b><br>This includes both the altar of burnt offering and the altar of incense. The burnt offering altar was for sacrifices, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation with God. The incense altar represented prayer and intercession. Both altars foreshadow Christ's sacrificial death and His role as our intercessor (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>the articles of the sanctuary used with them</b><br>These articles included various utensils and tools necessary for the rituals and sacrifices, such as bowls, pans, and censers. Each item had a specific purpose, underscoring the order and precision in worship. They highlight the meticulous nature of God's instructions and the importance of approaching Him with reverence and obedience.<p><b>and the curtain</b><br>The curtain, or veil, separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, signifying the barrier between God and humanity due to sin. Only the high priest could enter once a year on the Day of Atonement. The tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) symbolizes the removal of this barrier, granting believers direct access to God through Jesus.<p><b>all the service for these items</b><br>The Kohathites were tasked with the transportation and care of these sacred objects during Israel's wilderness journey. This service required strict adherence to God's commands, reflecting the seriousness of worship and the need for holiness. It underscores the theme of servanthood and dedication in the life of a believer, as seen in Christ's example (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites responsible for the care of the most sacred objects in the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, containing sacred items used in worship and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_table_of_showbread.htm">The Table of Showbread</a></b><br>A table in the Tabernacle where the bread of the Presence was placed, symbolizing God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lampstand.htm">The Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A seven-branched lampstand in the Tabernacle, symbolizing the light of God and His presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_responsibility.htm">Sacred Responsibility</a></b><br>The Kohathites were entrusted with the care of the most sacred items, reminding us of the importance of handling the things of God with reverence and responsibility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_tabernacle.htm">Symbolism of the Tabernacle</a></b><br>Each item in the Tabernacle had symbolic meaning, pointing to God's presence, provision, and light.
