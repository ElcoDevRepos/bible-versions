Historically, the Israelites had been miraculously delivered from Egypt and were being sustained by God in the wilderness. Their complaint about the lack of variety in their diet shows a lack of faith and trust in God's plan. This attitude is a recurring theme in the wilderness narratives, highlighting human tendency to focus on immediate desires rather than spiritual sustenance. The loss of appetite symbolizes a deeper spiritual malaise, where physical cravings overshadow spiritual needs.<p><b>there is nothing to see</b><br>The Israelites' complaint about having "nothing to see" suggests a desire for the tangible and the familiar, reminiscent of their time in Egypt. This reflects a common human struggle with contentment and the temptation to look back at past comforts rather than forward to God's promises. The phrase also indicates a lack of spiritual vision, as they fail to recognize the miraculous nature of the manna provided by God. This mirrors the spiritual blindness that Jesus addresses in the New Testament, where people often fail to see the spiritual truths before them.<p><b>but this manna!&#8221;</b><br>Manna was the miraculous food provided by God to sustain the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. It is described in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> as a fine, flaky substance that appeared on the ground each morning. Theologically, manna is a type of Christ, as Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>, drawing a parallel between the manna that sustained physical life and His own role in providing spiritual sustenance. The Israelites' disdain for manna foreshadows the rejection of Christ by many, despite His being the true sustenance for eternal life. This complaint also underscores the theme of God's provision and the human tendency to take divine gifts for granted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.

Yesterday&#8217;s miracles have faded in their minds, and the present moment feels bleak.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord had rescued them from Egypt with &#8220;a mighty hand and an outstretched arm&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He had led them by cloud and fire (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet, just as quickly as the Red Sea closed, their memories closed to God&#8217;s recent mercies (<a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>).<p>The warning is clear: when we stop rehearsing God&#8217;s past faithfulness, discontent rushes in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our appetite is gone</b><p>The complaint is visceral&#8212;&#8220;we don&#8217;t feel like eating anymore.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physical craving masks a deeper spiritual dullness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already promised to &#8220;satisfy you with good&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>), but they redefine &#8220;good&#8221; as whatever Egypt once offered (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; True satisfaction flows from trusting the Giver more than the gifts (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p>When hearts drift from worship to want, even heaven-sent provision feels bland.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is nothing to see</b><p>Their vision narrows to the immediate and the visible.<p>&#8226; They overlook the daily miracle lying on the desert floor (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; They dismiss the cloud that shelters by day and the fire that warms by night (<a href="/nehemiah/9-19.htm">Nehemiah 9:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Focusing on the seen rather than the unseen blinds us to God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>).<p>Discontent distorts perception; abundance starts to look like absence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but this manna!</b><p>The exclamation drips with contempt for the very bread of heaven.<p>&#8226; Manna was a tangible testimony that &#8220;man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadowed Christ, &#8220;the true bread from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting manna parallels rejecting Christ&#8217;s sufficiency&#8212;settling for worldly leeks and onions over eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/13-9.htm">Hebrews 13:9</a>).<p>To scorn God&#8217;s provision is to scorn God Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a> exposes a heart posture rather than a pantry problem. Forgetfulness of God&#8217;s past grace (&#8220;But now&#8221;) breeds loss of appetite for His present gifts. Tunnel vision (&#8220;there is nothing to see&#8221;) turns a miracle into monotony (&#8220;but this manna!&#8221;). The verse invites us to remember, receive, and rejoice in the daily bread God faithfully sets before us&#8212;in the wilderness then, and in Christ today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">There is nothing at all . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">there is nothing, except that our eyes </span>(<span class= "ital">look</span>)<span class= "ital"> upon, the manna.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our soul is</span> <span class="cmt_word">dried away.</span> This exaggerated statement expressed their craving for the juicy and savoury food of which they had been thinking, and which was obviously unattainable in the wilderness. There is a physical craving in man for variety of diet, and especially for such condiments and flavours as he has been used to all his life, which makes the lack of them a real hardship. It is not necessary to condemn the Israelites for feeling very keenly the loss of their accustomed food, which is notoriously the one thing which the poorest classes <span class="cmt_word">are</span> least able to bear; it is only necessary to condemn them for making this one loss of more account than all their gain. <span class="cmt_word">There is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</span> Rather, "we have nothing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>) except that our eye (falls) upon this manna." These graphic words speak of the longing looks which turned in every direction after the accustomed dainties, only to fall with disgust upon the inevitable manna. It was very ungrateful of them to speak disparagingly of the manna, which was good and wholesome food, and sufficient to keep them in health and strength; but it is useless to deny that manna only for people who had been accustomed to a rich and varied diet must have been exceedingly trying both to the palate and the stomach (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
