This role was part of the kinship-based justice system, where family members were responsible for ensuring justice. The Hebrew term "goel" is used, which also refers to a kinsman-redeemer, highlighting the dual role of avenging and redeeming. This concept is seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz acts as a redeemer. The avenger of blood was a legal figure, not acting out of personal vengeance but fulfilling a societal duty.<p><b>is to put the murderer to death</b><br>This directive was part of the Mosaic Law, which prescribed capital punishment for intentional murder, reflecting the value placed on human life made in God's image (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The law distinguished between murder and manslaughter, with cities of refuge established for those who killed unintentionally (<a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11-15</a>). This ensured that justice was served while preventing blood feuds and cycles of revenge. The death penalty for murder underscored the seriousness of taking a life and the need for justice.<p><b>when he finds him</b><br>The phrase implies a pursuit, indicating that the avenger of blood had the responsibility to actively seek out the murderer. This pursuit was not arbitrary but was to be conducted within the legal framework provided by the cities of refuge. The cities served as a place where the accused could seek asylum and await a fair trial (<a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4-6</a>). This system ensured that the avenger's actions were not based on impulse but on legal proceedings.<p><b>he is to kill him</b><br>The execution of justice was a communal responsibility, with the avenger acting on behalf of the community and under the law. This action was not personal vengeance but a fulfillment of divine justice as outlined in the law. The avenger's role prefigures Christ's work as both judge and redeemer, who will ultimately execute divine justice (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-9</a>) while offering redemption. The balance of justice and mercy is a recurring theme in Scripture, culminating in the work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/avenger_of_blood.htm">Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, this was typically a close relative of a person who was killed.
