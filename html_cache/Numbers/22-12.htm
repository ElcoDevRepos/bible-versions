This interaction highlights God's sovereignty and ability to use individuals outside of Israel for His purposes. Balaam's story is unique as it shows God's control over all nations and peoples, not just Israel. This phrase sets the stage for the unfolding narrative where God intervenes in human affairs to protect His chosen people.<p><b>Do not go with them.</b><br>God's command to Balaam is clear and direct, prohibiting him from accompanying the Moabite messengers. This instruction underscores the importance of obedience to God's will, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The command also reflects God's protective nature over Israel, ensuring that Balaam does not align himself with those who intend harm against His people. This directive can be seen as a test of Balaam's allegiance and willingness to submit to God's authority.<p><b>You are not to curse this people,</b><br>The prohibition against cursing Israel is significant, as it demonstrates God's covenantal relationship with His people. Cursing in the ancient Near Eastern context was believed to have real power, and God's intervention prevents any potential spiritual harm. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's blessing and protection over Israel, as seen in His promises to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God declares that those who bless Israel will be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be cursed.<p><b>for they are blessed.</b><br>God's declaration that Israel is blessed is rooted in His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This blessing is not based on Israel's merit but on God's faithfulness and promises. The concept of blessing is central to the biblical narrative, often associated with God's favor, provision, and protection. This statement reaffirms Israel's unique status as God's chosen people and foreshadows the ultimate blessing through Jesus Christ, a descendant of Israel, who brings salvation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner known for his ability to bless or curse.
