The Moabites were descendants of Lot and had a history of conflict with Israel. The act of cursing was believed to invoke supernatural power to harm or weaken an enemy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, words were considered powerful, and a curse was thought to have tangible effects. This reflects the belief in the power of spoken words, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham and curse those who curse him.<p><b>because they are too mighty for me</b><br>The Israelites, having recently defeated the Amorites, were seen as a formidable force. Balak's fear highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The Moabites' fear also underscores the reputation of Israel's God, who had delivered them from Egypt and sustained them in the wilderness. This fear is reminiscent of Rahab's words in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where she acknowledges the dread that Israel's God instilled in the hearts of their enemies.<p><b>Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land</b><br>Balak's hope to drive Israel out reflects the territorial conflicts common in the ancient Near East. The land was a critical resource, and control over it was essential for survival and prosperity. This desire to expel Israel contrasts with God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The struggle for the land is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing the broader spiritual battle between God's people and the forces opposed to His purposes.<p><b>for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed</b><br>Balak acknowledges Balaam's reputation as a powerful seer whose blessings and curses are effective. This reflects the belief in the efficacy of prophetic words, a concept seen in the patriarchal blessings in Genesis, such as Isaac's blessing of Jacob (Genesis 27). The statement also echoes God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, indicating a recognition, albeit misguided, of the divine principle that God's chosen people are under His protection. This phrase foreshadows the ultimate futility of Balak's plan, as God's blessing on Israel cannot be overturned by human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites due to their numbers and past victories.

Each phrase exposes human anxiety clashing with divine promise. Balak&#8217;s urgency, the request for a curse, acknowledgment of Israel&#8217;s strength, hope of military victory, and confidence in Balaam&#8217;s powers all collide with the unchangeable word God gave to Abraham. The verse therefore highlights the futility of opposing God&#8217;s plan and the security of His people under His irrevocable blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Curse me this people.--</span>Balak undoubtedly believed in the efficacy of Balaam's magical incantations. It is deserving of observation, moreover, that, as has been remarked by Keil (<span class= "ital">in loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">, "</span>it is frequently celebrated as a great favour displayed towards Israel that the Lord did not hearken to Balaam, but turned the curse into a blessing" (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-5.htm" title="Nevertheless the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because the LORD your God loved you.">Deuteronomy 23:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-10.htm" title="But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.">Joshua 24:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-2.htm" title="Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: however, our God turned the curse into a blessing.">Nehemiah 13:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest</span> is <span class="cmt_word">cursed.</span> This was the language of flattery intended to secure the prophet's services. No doubt, however, Balak, like other heathens, had a profound though capricious belief in the real effect of curses and anathemas pronounced by men who had private intercourse and influence with the unseen powers. That error, like most superstitions, was the perversion of a truth; there are both benedictions and censures which, uttered by human lips, carry with them the sanction and enforcement of Heaven. The error of antiquity lay in ignorance or forgetfulness that, as water cannot rise higher than its source, so neither blessing nor cursing can possibly take any effect beyond the will and purpose of the Father of our souls. Balaam knew this, but it was perhaps his misfortune to have been trained from childhood to maintain his position and his wealth by trading upon the superstitions of his neighbours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
