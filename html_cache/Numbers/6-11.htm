The priest, acting as a mediator, performs this offering, highlighting the necessity of a mediator between God and man. This foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who is both the High Priest and the perfect sin offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>and the other as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing the complete surrender to God. It was entirely consumed by fire, representing total dedication. This offering complements the sin offering, emphasizing that atonement and dedication to God go hand in hand. The burnt offering points to Christ's complete obedience and sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>to make atonement for him</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the shedding of blood. In the context of <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. This anticipates the ultimate atonement made by Christ on the cross, where His blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>).<p><b>because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body</b><br>Contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>). This law reflects the holiness required by God and the separation from death, which is a result of sin. It illustrates the pervasive nature of sin and the need for constant vigilance in maintaining purity. This also points to the victory over death achieved through Christ's resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<p><b>On that day he must consecrate his head again</b><br>The Nazarite vow, which this passage pertains to, involved a period of consecration to God, symbolized by not cutting one's hair. If defiled, the individual had to restart the vow, signifying a renewed commitment to holiness. This act of consecration is a reminder of the call to holiness for believers, who are to be set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). It also reflects the new beginning offered through Christ, who makes all things new (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals to atone for sin and restore the Nazirite's consecration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nazirite.htm">The Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who has taken a special vow of separation to the Lord, which includes abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice made to atone for unintentional sins, symbolizing purification and forgiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice representing complete dedication and surrender to God, signifying the Nazirite's renewed commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/presence_of_a_dead_body.htm">Presence of a Dead Body</a></b><br>Contact with a corpse rendered a person ceremonially unclean, disrupting the Nazirite vow and requiring atonement and reconsecration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, even unintentional, requires atonement.

holiness is not merely intentional obedience but complete separation unto God (<a href="/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- The Nazirite vow heightened this standard, reminding Israel that God&#8217;s people are called to a distinct life (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On that day he must consecrate his head again</b><p>- &#8220;Consecrate&#8221;

When the Nazirite vow is broken by accidental contact with death, two offerings restore fellowship: the sin offering securing forgiveness, the burnt offering re-establishing wholehearted devotion. Atonement is necessary because even unintended defilement is sin in God&#8217;s sight. Yet on the very same day, the worshiper may consecrate himself again, illustrating that God invites repentant people to begin afresh in purity and dedication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And the priest shall offer . . . --</span>The word which is here rendered "offer" (<span class= "ital">asah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>like the Greek <span class= "ital">poiein, </span>means literally "do."
