In the Old Testament, this figure appears at critical moments, such as with Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). This presence signifies divine intervention and authority, emphasizing the seriousness of Balaam's mission and God's direct involvement.<p><b>stood in a narrow passage</b><br>The narrow passage symbolizes a place of decision and confrontation. It represents a point where Balaam must choose between obedience to God or pursuing his own desires. This imagery is reminiscent of the "narrow path" in <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>, which speaks to the difficulty and importance of choosing the righteous path.<p><b>between two vineyards</b><br>Vineyards in biblical times were symbols of prosperity and blessing (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The location between two vineyards may suggest a place of potential blessing that Balaam is at risk of losing due to his disobedience. It also highlights the contrast between the abundance of God's provision and the barrenness of Balaam's spiritual state.<p><b>with walls on either side</b><br>The walls indicate restriction and limitation, suggesting that Balaam's path is being divinely constrained. This imagery can be connected to the concept of God's law as a boundary that guides and protects (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). The walls serve as a physical manifestation of God's attempt to prevent Balaam from straying into error.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often seen as a manifestation of God Himself.

In Balaam&#8217;s story the appearance halts a prophet racing toward sin, underscoring that God personally intervenes when His will is threatened.<p>&#8226; Balaam cannot see what his donkey sees, highlighting spiritual blindness that accompanies greed (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>).<p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s sword (<a href="/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>) reminds us of the sword that once barred Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and will judge again (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).

Balaam travels through land cultivated by others, yet plans to profit from Israel&#8217;s downfall.
