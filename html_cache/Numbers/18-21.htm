The Levites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, God provided for them through the tithes, which were a tenth of the produce and livestock of the Israelites. This system ensured that the Levites could focus on their spiritual responsibilities without the burden of agricultural labor. The concept of tithing is rooted in earlier biblical traditions, such as Abraham giving a tenth to Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>) and Jacob's vow to give a tenth to God (<a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>).<p><b>as an inheritance</b><br>The term "inheritance" here signifies a perpetual provision for the Levites, akin to the land inheritance given to other tribes. This underscores the idea that their service to God and the community was their portion and reward. The Levites' inheritance was unique, emphasizing their special role in Israel's spiritual life. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as having an inheritance in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>in return for the work they do</b><br>The Levites' work was essential for the spiritual well-being of Israel. They were responsible for the maintenance of the Tabernacle, teaching the Law, and performing sacrifices. This phrase highlights the principle of labor and reward, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. The Levites' service was not just ritualistic but involved teaching and guiding the people in God's ways, similar to the role of pastors and teachers in the church today (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p><b>the service of the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The Levites' service here was crucial for maintaining the holiness and order required for worship. This service included setting up, taking down, and transporting the Tabernacle, as well as assisting the priests in sacrifices and offerings. The Tabernacle is a type of Christ, as it foreshadows His role as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>). The Levites' service points to the ultimate service of Christ, who fulfilled the law and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe in Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tent of Meeting.

God is personally speaking, just as He does in <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;Behold, I am doing a new thing.&#8221; Whenever Scripture uses this term, it signals that the reader should pay close attention because something weighty is being revealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have given</b><p>God is the Giver. Everything originates with Him (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). His sovereign right to distribute resources is underscored in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, where He reminds Israel that He gives the power to gain wealth. Here, the gift is not a suggestion but a settled grant of provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the Levites</b><p>The Levites were set apart for sacred service (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5&#8211;10</a>). Unlike the other tribes, they received no territorial allotment (<a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>). God Himself was their portion (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). This unique calling required a unique means of sustenance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the tithes in Israel</b><p>A tithe&#8212;one-tenth of income or produce&#8212;belonged to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>). God assigns those tithes specifically to the Levites. This echoes <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>, where Jacob vowed to give a tenth to God, prefiguring this established practice. <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> later affirms that bringing the full tithe opens the windows of heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as an inheritance</b><p>Since the Levites received no land inheritance, the tithes functioned as their livelihood (<a href="/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>). <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a> paints the picture: &#8220;The LORD is my portion and my cup.&#8221; Their inheritance was both practical (food and provision) and spiritual (God Himself).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in return for the work they do</b><p>God ties provision to faithful service. Paul echoes this principle in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>, noting that those who serve at the altar share in the offerings. The Levites&#8217; labor justified their support; they were not idle recipients but diligent ministers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the service of the Tent of Meeting.</b><p>The Tent of Meeting was the center of worship (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42&#8211;43</a>). Caring for it meant handling sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>), leading music (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>), guarding holiness (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>), and teaching the law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8&#8211;9</a>). Proper worship depended on their faithful attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a> shows God&#8217;s orderly design: He supplies dedicated servants through the faithful giving of His people. The Levites, lacking territorial wealth, received tithes as a concrete inheritance so they could focus on the vital, continuous ministry at the Tent of Meeting. God&#8217;s provision matched their calling, illustrating His fairness, faithfulness, and priority that worship and ministry be well supported.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">All the tenth in Israel.</span>--The reference here is to the first tithe, or tenth of the whole of the produce of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tenth.</span> The tithe of all fruits and flocks had been already claimed absolutely by the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30, 32</a>). It is probable indeed that the giving of tithes had been more or less a matter of obligation from time immemorial. Abraham had paid them on one memorable occasion (<a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>), and Jacob had vowed them on another (<a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>).
