In the biblical context, God speaking directly is a significant event, often marking a pivotal moment in the narrative. This command to "hear" underscores the necessity of attentive listening and obedience, a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel").<p><b>If there is a prophet among you,</b><br>Prophets in Israel served as God's spokespersons, delivering His messages to the people. This phrase acknowledges the presence of prophets within the community, a role established by God to guide, warn, and instruct His people. The historical context of Israel included many prophets, such as Moses, Samuel, Elijah, and Isaiah, who played crucial roles in shaping the nation's spiritual direction.<p><b>I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision;</b><br>Visions were a common method through which God communicated with His prophets. This divine revelation often provided guidance, warnings, or insights into God's plans. The use of visions is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as with Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1). This method of communication highlights God's initiative in making His will known to humanity.<p><b>I will speak to him in a dream.</b><br>Dreams, like visions, were another means by which God conveyed His messages. This form of communication is evident in the lives of biblical figures such as Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-10</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>). Dreams often contained symbolic imagery requiring interpretation, and they underscored the supernatural aspect of God's interaction with His chosen messengers. This method of revelation also points to the intimate and personal nature of God's relationship with His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Numbers, Moses is God's chosen leader for the Israelites.

An internal vision, in which the eyes (even if open) saw nothing, but the effects of vision' were produced upon the sensorium by other and supernatural means (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7, 8</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>).

The voice that spake to the prophet was an internal voice, causing no vibration of the outer air, but affecting only the inner and hidden seat of consciousness. It is not necessary to restrict the prophetic dream to the time of sleep; a waking state, resembling what we call day-dream, in which the external senses arc quiescent, and the imagination is freed from its usual restraints, was perhaps the more usual mental condition at the time. Indeed the Divine communications made to Joseph (<a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>) and to the Magi (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>) are almost the only ones we read of as made during actual sleep, unless we include the case of Pilate's wife (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a>); and none of these were prophets in the ordinary sense.
