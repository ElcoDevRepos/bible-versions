These cities were strategically located throughout the land of Israel to ensure accessibility. The establishment of these cities reflects God's justice and mercy, offering protection while awaiting a fair trial. The cities of refuge are a type of Christ, who provides refuge and salvation for sinners. In <a href="/joshua/20.htm">Joshua 20</a>, the specific cities are named: Kedesh, Shechem, Hebron, Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan.<p><b>so that a person who kills someone unintentionally</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between intentional murder and accidental killing, which is crucial in biblical law. The Hebrew term for "unintentionally" implies a lack of premeditation or malice. The law recognizes human fallibility and provides a means of protection for those who have caused death without intent. This reflects the biblical principle of justice tempered with mercy, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, where God provides a place for the unintentional killer to flee.<p><b>may flee there</b><br>The provision for fleeing to a city of refuge underscores the urgency and necessity of seeking protection. The act of fleeing symbolizes repentance and the desire for reconciliation. In a broader theological context, this mirrors the sinner's flight to Christ for refuge from the consequences of sin. The cities of refuge serve as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of Christ as our ultimate refuge, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>, where believers are encouraged to "flee for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated places where individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum to avoid revenge from the victim's family until a fair trial could be conducted.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manslayer.htm">Manslayer</a></b><br>A person who has killed another unintentionally, without premeditation or malice aforethought.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God to whom these laws were given, emphasizing justice and mercy within their community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_cities.htm">Levitical Cities</a></b><br>The cities of refuge were among the 48 cities given to the Levites, the priestly tribe of Israel, indicating a connection between justice and spiritual oversight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/avenger_of_blood.htm">Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member of the deceased who had the cultural duty to avenge the death, highlighting the need for a legal system to prevent cycles of violence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_mercy.htm">Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cities of refuge illustrate God's balance of justice and mercy, providing protection for those who have sinned unintentionally while ensuring a fair trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>This law underscores the value God places on human life, requiring careful consideration and due process before taking action against someone who has caused a death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_refuge.htm">Spiritual Refuge</a></b><br>Just as the cities provided physical safety, believers today find spiritual refuge in Christ, who offers protection and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The establishment of these cities highlights the community's role in upholding justice and protecting the vulnerable, a principle that applies to the church today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_reconciliation.htm">Forgiveness and Reconciliation</a></b><br>The provision for unintentional manslaughter encourages forgiveness and reconciliation, rather than revenge, within the community.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_35_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 35:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_35_11_Justice_mercy_s_role.htm">How does Numbers 35:11 emphasize the importance of justice and mercy in society?

These cities embody God&#8217;s respect for life, His provision against impulsive vengeance, and His foreshadowing of the ultimate refuge found in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you.</span> God had already announced that he would appoint a place whither one guilty of unpremeditated manslaughter might flee for safety (<a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a>). The expression there used does not point to more than one "place," but it is not inconsistent with several. Probably the right of sanctuary has been recognized from the earliest times in which any local appropriation of places to sacred purposes has been made. It is an instinct of religion to look upon one who has escaped into a sacred enclosure as being under the personal protection of the presiding deity. It is certain that the right was largely recognized in Egypt, where the priestly caste was so powerful and ambitious; and this is no doubt the reason (humanly speaking) for the promise in <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, and for the command in the following verse. Inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the Lord's, any places within it might he endowed with rights of sanctuary, but it was obviously suitable that they should be Levitical cities; the Divine prerogative of mercy could nowhere be better exercised, nor would any citizens be better qualified to pronounce and to uphold the rightful decision in each case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">designate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hiq&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
