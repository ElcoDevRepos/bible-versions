It reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during their 40-year period of wandering after their exodus from Egypt. This journey was a result of their disobedience and lack of faith, as seen in <a href="/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26-35</a>, where God decreed that the generation that left Egypt would not enter the Promised Land. The setting out signifies obedience to God's command to move forward, despite the challenges they faced.<p><b>and camped at Oboth.</b><br>Oboth is one of the many locations where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey. The exact location of Oboth is not definitively known today, but it is believed to be in the region east of the Dead Sea, possibly in modern-day Jordan. This area was part of the territory of Edom, and the Israelites' journey through this region is significant as it reflects their interactions with neighboring peoples. The camping at Oboth indicates a temporary rest and a strategic pause in their journey, which was often necessary for logistical reasons such as gathering resources and maintaining the community's well-being. This stop is part of the broader narrative of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, illustrating their reliance on God's guidance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oboth.htm">Oboth</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey.

Every detail in Numbers is tied to a larger narrative that began with the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>) and will culminate in the promised land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>).<p>&#8211; It also links the verse to the immediate context: Israel has just seen judgment for impatience (<a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4&#8211;6</a>) and healing through the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-7.htm">Numbers 21:7&#8211;9</a>). &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that God&#8217;s grace not only heals but propels His people onward, echoing how He led them after earlier crises (<a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites</b><p>&#8211; This covenant community is traveling together; no one is left to wander alone (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>).<p>&#8211; Their identity is rooted in God&#8217;s promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2&#8211;3</a>) and affirmed at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>).

This illustrates <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>: even opposition guides God&#8217;s people along His perfect route.<p>&#8211; The stop foreshadows progress: after Oboth come Iye-abarim and the Arnon, the frontier of promised territory (<a href="/numbers/21-11.htm">Numbers 21:11&#8211;13</a>).

The former of these places is thought by some to have derived its name from the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">zelem </span>(image, or likeness), and to have been the place at which the likeness of the serpents which bit the Israelites was set up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel set forward</span>, and pitched in Oboth. In the list of chapter 33, there occur two other stations, Zahnonah and Phunon, between Mount Hor and Oboth. Phunon may be the Pinou of <a href="/genesis/36-41.htm">Genesis 36:41</a>, but it is a mere conjecture. All we can conclude with any certainty is that the Israelites passed round the southern end of the mountains of Edom by the Wady el Ithm, and then marched northwards along the eastern border of Edom by the route now followed between Mekba and Damascus. On this side the mountains are far less precipitous and defensible than on the other, and this circumstance must have abated the insolence of the Edomites. Moreover, they must now have seen enough of Israel to know that, while immensely formidable in number and discipline, he had no hostile designs against them. It is therefore not surprising to find from <a href="/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a> that on this side the mountaineers supplied Israel with bread and water, just as they supply the pilgrim caravans at the present day. That they exacted payment for what they supplied was perfectly reasonable: no one could expect a poor people to feed a nation of two million souls, however nearly related, for nothing. Oboth has been identified with the modern halting-place of el-Ahsa, on the pilgrim route above mentioned, on the ground of supposed similarity in the meaning of the names; but the true rendering of Oboth is doubtful (see on Leviticus 19:31), and, apart from that, any such similarity of meaning is too vague and slight a ground for any argument to be built upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/21-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5265.htm">Strong's 5265: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull up, the tent-pins, start on a, journey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and camped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2583.htm">Strong's 2583: </a> </span><span class="str2">To incline, to decline, to pitch a, tent, gen, to encamp</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Oboth.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1489;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_88.htm">Strong's 88: </a> </span><span class="str2">Oboth -- 'water-skins', a place in Edom</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/21-10.htm">OT Law: Numbers 21:10 The children of Israel traveled and encamped (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/21-9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 21:9"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 21:9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/21-11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 21:11"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 21:11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
