This timeframe is seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the forty days and nights of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Moses' forty days on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). The use of forty days here underscores the thoroughness of the exploration and the completeness of the report that the spies were to bring back.<p><b>the men returned</b><br>The men referred to here are the twelve spies, one from each tribe of Israel, who were chosen to scout the land of Canaan. Their return marks the completion of their mission and the beginning of a pivotal moment for the Israelites. The spies' report would significantly influence the Israelites' faith and decisions. This return is a moment of anticipation, as the people awaited news of the Promised Land.<p><b>from spying out the land</b><br>The land in question is Canaan, the land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). Spying out the land involved assessing its fertility, the strength of its inhabitants, and the fortifications of its cities. This mission was not just a military reconnaissance but also a test of faith for the Israelites. The land was described as "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating its richness and abundance. However, the spies' report would reveal both the land's potential and the challenges that lay ahead, setting the stage for the Israelites' response and their subsequent wanderings in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, were chosen to scout the land of Canaan.

God Himself had commanded Moses, &#8220;Send out for yourself men to explore the land of Canaan&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>), so everything that follows is the direct result of obedience to His expressed will.<p>&#8226; It also points us back to the preparation: the selection of one leader from each tribe (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3&#8211;16</a>). Their pedigree underscores that this was not a casual excursion but a covenant people fulfilling a covenant assignment.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a> shows a later, similar &#8220;after&#8221; moment as Joshua sends spies into Jericho&#8212;another step in God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>forty days</b><p>&#8226; The time span is literal, not symbolic only. Forty frequently marks periods of testing or preparation:<p>&#8211; Rain fell &#8220;forty days and forty nights&#8221; in Noah&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Moses fasted forty days on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>).<p>&#8211; Elijah journeyed forty days to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus fasted forty days in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, these forty days of exploration would later mirror forty years of wilderness wandering (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>). God measures time precisely; rebellion lengthens a brief test into a generation-long lesson.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the men returned</b><p>&#8226; All twelve came back&#8212;nobody was lost. Their safe return confirms God&#8217;s protective hand even in enemy territory, echoing later promises such as <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, &#8220;When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Return implies accountability. Like servants in Jesus&#8217; parable who report to their master (<a href="/luke/19-15.htm">Luke 19:15</a>), the spies must now give an honest account.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-24.htm">Deuteronomy 1:24&#8211;25</a> recalls this same moment, highlighting how the spies initially acknowledged the land&#8217;s goodness before fear overtook ten of them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from spying out the land</b><p>&#8226; The land is not abstract real estate; it is the tangible fulfillment of God&#8217;s oath to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>). Their scouting confirmed the promise&#8217;s accuracy: &#8220;It truly flows with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Spying was never meant to decide whether to enter but to strategize how. Faith should have interpreted the data. Caleb&#8217;s response, &#8220;Let us go up at once&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>), models the proper outcome of godly reconnaissance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16&#8211;19</a> later warns that those who &#8220;heard and rebelled&#8221; were the very ones who had witnessed these facts firsthand, reminding us that information without faith breeds unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-25.htm">Numbers 13:25</a> captures the pivotal moment when God&#8217;s appointed representatives complete a forty-day mission and report back. The verse spotlights divine timing, protective care, and covenant faithfulness, setting the stage for Israel&#8217;s crisis of belief. It teaches that accurate facts still demand trusting obedience, and that brief tests, if met with unbelief, can usher in prolonged discipline&#8212;yet God&#8217;s promises remain sure for those who respond with faith like Caleb and Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">After forty days.--</span>This time allowed a full and careful exploration of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They returned...</span> <span class="cmt_word">after forty days.</span> This is a period of time which constantly recurs in the sacred books (see on Exodus 24:18).
