The phrase &#8220;from the tribe of Issachar&#8221; reminds us that every clan in Israel had a personal stake in God&#8217;s promise to inherit Canaan (cf. <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Issachar&#8217;s legacy is marked by hard work and insight&#8212;Jacob pictured the tribe as &#8220;a strong donkey&#8230;bending his shoulder to bear a load&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>), and Moses praised their joy in the blessings of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; By sending a delegate, Issachar publicly affirmed confidence in God&#8217;s covenant and accepted responsibility for the mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Igal</b><p>&#8226; The name appears only here and in the spy list of verse 7. Igal stood shoulder-to-shoulder with men like Caleb and Joshua, sharing the same instructions (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17-20</a>) and the same opportunities.<p>&#8226; Sadly, the ten spies who brought back a fearful report persuaded the community to rebel (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>; 14:1-4). Scripture does not single out Igal&#8217;s personal words, yet his silence in defending faith reveals how easily one can drift with the crowd.<p>&#8226; Lessons for us:<p>&#8211; Obedience is more than starting well; it is finishing in faith (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-14</a>).<p>&#8211; A believer&#8217;s influence, for good or ill, often lies in whether we support courageous voices like Caleb&#8217;s or fold under pressure (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>son of Joseph</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Son of Joseph&#8221; distinguishes Igal&#8217;s immediate family, not the patriarch Joseph of Genesis. Even so, the shared name evokes the earlier Joseph who trusted God despite obstacles (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Family identity matters in Scripture. A father&#8217;s faith (or lack of it) shapes future generations (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). By including Joseph&#8217;s name, the verse invites readers to consider the spiritual heritage passed down to Igal.<p>&#8226; Application points:<p>&#8211; Our lineage can spur us toward faithfulness, but each person must choose obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Ezekiel 18:19-20</a>).<p>&#8211; Whether well-known or obscure, parents influence the next link in the chain; therefore, faith lived out at home matters deeply (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph&#8221;&#8212;places Issachar&#8217;s representative squarely in the story of Israel&#8217;s testing at the edge of the Promised Land. The phrase highlights three truths: every tribe is accountable to trust God&#8217;s promises; every individual, like Igal, faces the choice to stand firm in faith; and every family legacy, signaled by &#8220;son of Joseph,&#8221; matters in shaping that choice. Together the words call us to embrace our identity in God&#8217;s people, exercise personal courage, and pass on a heritage of steadfast belief.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">from the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Issachar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1499;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#183;&#7733;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3485.htm">Strong's 3485: </a> </span><span class="str2">Issachar -- perhaps 'there is recompense', a son of Jacob and Leah, also a son of Obed-edom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Igal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7713;&#183;&#8217;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3008.htm">Strong's 3008: </a> </span><span class="str2">Igal -- 'He redeems', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Joseph;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1469;&#1507;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/13-7.htm">Numbers 13:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/13-7.htm">OT Law: Numbers 13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar Igal (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/13-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 13:6"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 13:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/13-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 13:8"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 13:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
