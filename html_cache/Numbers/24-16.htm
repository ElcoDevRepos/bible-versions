In the biblical context, Balaam is a complex figure who is both a true prophet and yet often associated with negative actions (Numbers 22-24). His ability to hear God's words indicates divine revelation, a theme consistent with other prophets like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9-18</a>). This highlights the sovereignty of God in choosing His messengers, regardless of their background.<p><b>who has knowledge from the Most High</b><br>The term "Most High" is a title for God that emphasizes His supreme authority and power, often used in contexts of divine revelation and wisdom (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>). Balaam's knowledge from the Most High suggests a deep, divinely granted understanding, aligning him with figures like Daniel, who also received wisdom and insight from God (<a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20-23</a>). This knowledge is not merely intellectual but is rooted in a spiritual awareness of God's plans and purposes.<p><b>who sees a vision from the Almighty</b><br>Visions are a common means of divine communication in the Bible, as seen with prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-3</a>). The term "Almighty" (El Shaddai) underscores God's omnipotence and His ability to reveal future events. Balaam's vision is significant as it includes messianic prophecy, foretelling the rise of a star out of Jacob (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), which Christians interpret as a type of Christ, pointing to His coming as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>who bows down with eyes wide open</b><br>This phrase suggests a posture of humility and reverence before God, a common response to divine revelation (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). Balaam's eyes being "wide open" indicates a clear and unobstructed perception of God's message, contrasting with those who are spiritually blind (<a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>). This openness to God's revelation is essential for true prophecy and aligns with the New Testament call for believers to be spiritually alert and receptive (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is known for his interactions with Balak, the king of Moab.

Compare <a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10&#8211;16</a> where Peter &#8220;saw the heavens opened&#8221; and received directions that reshaped the church.<p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s vision pierces the ages: &#8220;I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). The Almighty&#8217;s vision stretches from Israel&#8217;s camp to the far horizon of the coming King.<p>&#8226; Because it is God-given, the vision is trustworthy, aligning with <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who bows down with eyes wide open</b><p>&#8220;who bows down with eyes wide open&#8221;<p>&#8226; Revelation drives Balaam to a posture of worship; he falls prostrate, yet his eyes remain open to what God shows. <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> records a similar response: &#8220;I fell facedown, and I heard a voice speaking.&#8221;<p>&#8226; True encounter with God humbles the body while enlightening the spirit. <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a> promises that the Spirit &#8220;will guide you into all truth,&#8221; opening eyes even while we bow in submission.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a> depicts John likewise collapsing before the risen Christ, affirming that the appropriate response to divine disclosure is awe-filled obedience.<p>&#8226; The open eyes indicate clarity, not confusion. God&#8217;s Word is meant to be understood and acted upon (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a> stacks four vivid descriptors to certify that Balaam&#8217;s oracle is direct, authoritative revelation: he hears God&#8217;s words, receives knowledge from the Most High, beholds a vision from the Almighty, and responds in humbled worship with eyes fully open. Together they assure us that the prophecy&#8212;immediately blessing Israel and ultimately foretelling Messiah&#8212;rests on the unassailable authority of the living God. Our proper response mirrors Balaam&#8217;s posture: listen, learn, behold, and bow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Which heard . . . and knew.--</span>Better, w<span class= "ital">hich heareth </span>. . . <span class= "ital">and knoweth.</span><p><span class= "bld">Which saw.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">he seeth.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knew the knowledge of the Most High.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3a5;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. This expression alone distinguishes this introduction of Balaam's mashal from the former one (verses 3, 4), but it is difficult to say that it really adds anything to our understanding of his mental state. If we ask when Balaam had received the revelation which he now proceeds to communicate, it would seem most natural to reply that it was made known to him when "the Spirit of God came upon him," and that Balak's anger had interrupted him in the midst of his mashal, or possibly he had kept it back, as too distasteful to his patron, until he saw that he had nothing more to expect from that quarter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the prophecy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of one who hears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_561.htm">Strong's 561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something said</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who has knowledge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
