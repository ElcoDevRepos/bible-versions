The requirement to "arm themselves" indicates the necessity for these tribes to participate in the military conquest of Canaan, demonstrating unity and shared responsibility among the Israelites. This reflects the broader biblical theme of communal obligation and the importance of collective action in fulfilling God's promises. The crossing of the Jordan is symbolic of entering into God's promises, reminiscent of the crossing of the Red Sea, which was a type of baptism and deliverance.<p><b>then they must accept their possession among you</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the consequence of not participating in the conquest: the tribes would forfeit their claim to the land east of the Jordan and instead receive an inheritance within Canaan. This underscores the principle of obedience and the conditional nature of God's blessings. The concept of "possession" is significant in biblical terms, as it relates to the covenantal promise of land given to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of spiritual inheritance through faith and obedience.<p><b>in the land of Canaan.</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is a region of great historical and theological significance, representing the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. The land of Canaan is often seen as a type of the Kingdom of God, a place of rest and blessing for God's people. Theologically, it points to the ultimate rest and inheritance believers have in Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>. The historical conquest of Canaan by the Israelites is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the transition from nomadic life to settled nationhood under God's law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_reuben_and_gad.htm">The Tribes of Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River because the land was suitable for their livestock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who negotiated with the tribes of Reuben and Gad regarding their request to settle outside the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_canaan.htm">The Land of Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that God had designated for the Israelites, located west of the Jordan River.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary that the Israelites needed to cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_community.htm">The Israelite Community</a></b><br>The collective group of God's chosen people, who were journeying to the land promised to their ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_community.htm">Commitment to Community</a></b><br>The tribes of Reuben and Gad were reminded of their responsibility to the larger community of Israel.
