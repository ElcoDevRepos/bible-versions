This separation is rooted in the events of <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the Levites stood with Moses against idolatry. Their dedication to God&#8217;s service is a recurring theme, emphasizing holiness and obedience. The Levites did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, as their inheritance was the Lord Himself (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).<p><b>and present them to Aaron the priest</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed as the first high priest. Presenting the Levites to Aaron signifies their role as assistants to the priesthood, highlighting the hierarchical structure within the religious duties of Israel. This presentation underscores the importance of order and divine appointment in worship practices. Aaron's priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest, interceding on our behalf (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>to assist him</b><br>The Levites were tasked with various duties related to the tabernacle, including its transportation, maintenance, and protection. Their assistance was crucial for the functioning of the tabernacle, which was the center of Israelite worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. This assistance prefigures the role of believers as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), serving God and supporting the ministry of reconciliation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_levi.htm">The Tribe of Levi</a></b><br>The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and service to God.

Earlier the LORD had already claimed the firstborn of Israel for Himself (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>), yet He substitutes the Levites in their place (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>). This calling is rooted in events like <a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, where the sons of Levi rallied to Moses&#8217; side in zeal for the LORD. Because of that faithfulness, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> states, &#8220;At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to bless in His name, to this day.&#8221; By commanding the entire tribe to come forward, God underlines that their identity, inheritance, and livelihood are now bound up in worship and service rather than land or warfare (<a href="/numbers/1-49.htm">Numbers 1:49-53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Present them</b><p>The phrase &#8220;present them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>) points to a public, ceremonial hand-off. <a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a> records a similar moment when Moses &#8220;presented Aaron and his sons.&#8221; Later, <a href="/numbers/8-10.htm">Numbers 8:10-11</a> prescribes that the Israelites lay hands on the Levites while Aaron &#8220;presents the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the Israelites.&#8221; Presentation means consecration: setting people apart so that every Israelite can see God&#8217;s choice. In New-Covenant terms, believers echo this idea when we &#8220;present [our] bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The movement from common life to holy service is always visible and intentional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Aaron the priest</b><p>The Levites are not an independent ministry. They belong &#8220;to Aaron the priest&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>), the man God had already installed as high priest in <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>. Aaron represents mediation and atonement, and the Levites&#8217; submission to him protects Israel from unauthorized worship (<a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-3</a>). When Korah challenged this order, the earth swallowed him (<a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>), underscoring that priestly authority comes from God, not ambition. <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> echoes the same principle: &#8220;No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God.&#8221; The Levites, therefore, model obedient cooperation under God-appointed leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To assist him</b><p>The goal is practical: &#8220;to assist him&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>). <a href="/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7-8</a> immediately lists their tasks:<p>&#8226; guarding the Tent of Meeting and its furnishings,<p>&#8226; ministering &#8220;on behalf of the Israelites,&#8221;<p>&#8226; performing &#8220;all the duties of the tabernacle.&#8221;<p>These jobs range from carrying heavy frames (<a href="/bsb/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4</a>), to singing (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>), to teaching God&#8217;s law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>). Without this support, Aaron&#8217;s priestly ministry would stall and the camp would face wrath (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>). In the New Testament, a similar pattern appears when the apostles appoint deacons so they can &#8220;devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>). God values teamwork where each role frees others to fulfill theirs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a> shows God calling, consecrating, ordering, and equipping. He selects an entire tribe, publicly sets them apart, places them under the high priest&#8217;s authority, and assigns them concrete work that safeguards worship. The verse illustrates how divine calling is communal, visible, structured, and practical&#8212;principles that still shape faithful service today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bring the tribe of Levi</span> <span class="cmt_word">near.</span> Not by any outward act of presentation, but by assigning to them solemnly the duties following.
