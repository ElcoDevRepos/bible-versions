Dan's name means "judge," reflecting Rachel's hope for vindication. The tribe of Dan was allotted territory in the northern part of Israel, although initially, they struggled to fully possess their inheritance due to the presence of strong Canaanite inhabitants. This tribe is often associated with idolatry, as seen in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where they set up a carved image. In the context of <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, the tribe of Dan is represented among the twelve spies sent to explore Canaan, indicating their role and responsibility in the collective mission of Israel.<p><b>Ammiel son of Gemalli</b><br>Ammiel, whose name means "people of God," was chosen as the representative from the tribe of Dan to spy out the land of Canaan. His father's name, Gemalli, is less known, but the mention of lineage underscores the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in Israelite society. Ammiel's role as a spy was significant, as he was tasked with assessing the land promised to the Israelites by God. However, like most of the spies, Ammiel brought back a negative report, focusing on the challenges rather than the opportunities, which contributed to the Israelites' fear and reluctance to enter the land. This incident highlights the theme of faith versus fear, a recurring motif in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammiel.htm">Ammiel</a></b><br>Ammiel is one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan.
