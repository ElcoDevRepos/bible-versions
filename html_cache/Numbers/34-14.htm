These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, in the land of Gilead, because it was suitable for their large herds and flocks (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). This decision reflects their pastoral lifestyle and the importance of livestock in their economy and culture. Their choice also demonstrates a willingness to separate from the main body of Israel, which could be seen as a lack of faith in God's promise of the land west of the Jordan. However, they committed to helping the other tribes conquer the land of Canaan before settling permanently (<a href="/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16-19</a>).<p><b>along with the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><br>The half-tribe of Manasseh refers to the descendants of Joseph's son Manasseh, who were divided into two groups, one settling east of the Jordan and the other west. This division is significant as it shows the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, where they were to become two distinct tribes (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5-6</a>). The eastern half-tribe of Manasseh was granted land due to their military prowess and their role in the conquest of the Amorite kings, Sihon and Og (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13-15</a>). This allocation highlights the strategic importance of controlling territories on both sides of the Jordan River.<p><b>have already received their inheritance</b><br>The inheritance refers to the land apportioned to these tribes before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into Canaan. This early allocation was a result of their request and agreement to assist in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20-22</a>). The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised land to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This inheritance is not just a physical possession but a fulfillment of divine promise and a symbol of God's faithfulness. It also prefigures the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as co-heirs with Him (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), emphasizing the continuity of God's promises from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites.htm">Reubenites</a></b><br>Descendants of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn son.

The distribution instructions that follow apply to the remaining nine-and-a-half tribes precisely because some tribes are already settled (cf. <a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Reubenites and Gadites</b><p>- Reuben and Gad had requested territory east of the Jordan when they saw that region was suitable for their large herds (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>- Moses granted the request on condition they first help the rest of Israel conquer Canaan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>- Their choice reminds us that God allows legitimate personal desires yet requires faithfulness to communal obligations (compare <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><p>- Manasseh was Joseph&#8217;s eldest son; half the tribe joined Reuben and Gad in settling east of the Jordan, receiving Bashan and Gilead (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-17</a>).<p>- This division shows God&#8217;s flexibility within His covenant plan: a single tribe can have portions on both sides of the river, yet unity is preserved (see <a href="/joshua/1-12.htm">Joshua 1:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have already received</b><p>- &#8220;Have already received&#8221; highlights a past, completed action. Their possession is secure because God&#8217;s promise is sure (cf. <a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores divine faithfulness: when God grants an inheritance, it is as good as done, even before the entire conquest is finished (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their inheritance</b><p>- &#8220;Inheritance&#8221; (nachalah) consistently refers to God-given land, not earned property (<a href="/numbers/26-53.htm">Numbers 26:53-56</a>).<p>- By stating that these tribes &#8220;have already received their inheritance,&#8221; Moses clarifies why the forthcoming allocation in Canaan excludes them; their portion lies east of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a>).<p>- The verse also teaches that inheritance can differ among God&#8217;s people while remaining equally part of His promise&#8212;foreshadowing varied yet unified blessings in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/34-14.htm">Numbers 34:14</a> reminds Israel that Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh already possess their God-granted land east of the Jordan. This fact sets the stage for apportioning Canaan to the remaining tribes, demonstrates God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, and illustrates how individual desires can harmonize with communal obedience under divine sovereignty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/34-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the tribes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Reubenites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
