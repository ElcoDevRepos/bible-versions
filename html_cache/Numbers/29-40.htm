His role was to communicate God's laws and instructions to the Israelites. This phrase emphasizes Moses' obedience and faithfulness in delivering God's message. The Israelites, having been delivered from Egypt, were in the wilderness, receiving the law and instructions for worship and community living. This context highlights the importance of Moses' leadership in guiding the people according to divine direction.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. It reflects the biblical principle that God's instructions are to be followed precisely, without alteration. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch, where blessings are often contingent upon adherence to God's laws. The phrase also points to the authority of God's word, as delivered through His chosen servant, Moses. In a broader biblical context, this obedience prefigures the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and the prophets, acting in complete accordance with the Father's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His commandments and guide the people through the wilderness.
