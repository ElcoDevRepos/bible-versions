This phrase indicates the priest's role in addressing issues of suspected infidelity, as outlined in the surrounding verses. The act of bringing the wife forward signifies a formal and public process, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where personal matters often had public implications.<p><b>and have her stand before the LORD.</b><br>Standing before the LORD implies being in the presence of God, often symbolized by the Tabernacle or later the Temple. This setting underscores the gravity of the situation, as it is not merely a human judgment but one that involves divine oversight. The phrase suggests a direct appeal to God's justice and truth, highlighting the belief that God is the ultimate judge of human hearts and actions. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The act of standing before the LORD also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Christ as the ultimate mediator and judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the rituals and ensuring the law is upheld.
