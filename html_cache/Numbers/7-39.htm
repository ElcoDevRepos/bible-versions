Bulls were considered valuable livestock, representing strength and wealth. The use of a young bull in offerings is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>, where it is specified for burnt offerings. This offering symbolizes atonement and dedication to God, reflecting the worshiper's desire to be in right standing with Him. The bull's strength and vigor can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offered Himself in the prime of His life.<p><b>one ram</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing leadership and authority. In <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>, a ram is provided by God as a substitute for Isaac, prefiguring Christ's substitutionary atonement. The ram's horns are also significant, used in the shofar, a ceremonial instrument in Israelite worship. The offering of a ram in this context underscores the completeness and sufficiency of the sacrifice, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb of God.<p><b>and one male lamb a year old</b><br>The specification of a male lamb a year old is important, as it indicates the lamb is in its prime, without blemish, and suitable for sacrifice. This mirrors the requirements for the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>, which foreshadows Christ, the sinless Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The age and condition of the lamb highlight the purity and perfection required in a sacrifice, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus.<p><b>for a burnt offering</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing complete surrender and devotion to God. The entire animal was consumed by fire, representing the offerer's total commitment and the desire for purification. This type of offering is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> and is one of the most frequent offerings mentioned in the Old Testament. It points to the totality of Christ's sacrifice, who gave Himself wholly for humanity's redemption, fulfilling the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the offerings from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were commanded to bring offerings as part of their worship and dedication to the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_gad.htm">Tribe of Gad</a></b><br>The tribe responsible for the offerings on this particular day, as part of the dedication of the altar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering that was completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifice.htm">Understanding Sacrifice</a></b><br>The burnt offering represents complete surrender and dedication to God.

The bull represents strength and service, the ram symbolizes leadership and substitution, and the lamb signifies innocence and purity. These qualities are fulfilled in Christ and should be reflected in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>The offerings were a communal act of worship, reminding us of the importance of coming together as a body of believers to honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' adherence to the specific instructions for offerings highlights the importance of obedience in our walk with God.

In the sacrificial system a bull symbolized strength and costliness, calling worshipers to bring their very best to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). The priests themselves later offered a young bull on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>), underlining its role in covering sin. We see a preview of Christ&#8217;s perfect strength and worth&#8212;&#8220;how much more will the blood of Christ&#8230; cleanse our conscience&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). Practical takeaway: genuine worship is never cheap; it recognizes God&#8217;s supreme worth and responds with wholehearted, costly devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One ram</b><p>Next comes &#8220;one ram.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly pairs rams with consecration and substitution. God provided a ram in place of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). During priestly ordination the ram was wholly burnt &#8220;as a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>). Its horns picture power dedicated to God, reminding us that every ability we possess belongs on His altar. Jesus fulfilled the ram&#8217;s substitutionary role&#8212;He took our place, bearing God&#8217;s wrath so we could draw near (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One male lamb a year old</b><p>The list narrows to &#8220;one male lamb a year old.&#8221; A year-old lamb had reached full vigor yet remained unblemished and innocent, echoing the Passover requirement: &#8220;Your lamb shall be an unblemished male, a year old&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). John the Baptist later pointed to Jesus: &#8220;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). By specifying a single lamb, the text points beyond tribal gifts to the singular, sufficient sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). For us, the call is purity&#8212;offering lives kept free from the moral blemishes this world normalizes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For a burnt offering</b><p>All three animals were presented &#8220;for a burnt offering.&#8221; Unlike sin or peace offerings, the burnt offering was consumed entirely on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>), symbolizing total surrender to God and producing &#8220;a pleasing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). Noah&#8217;s post-flood burnt offering moved God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20-21</a>). Similarly, <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> urges believers to &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.&#8221; The altar flames picture complete dedication&#8212;nothing held back, every area of life yielded to His lordship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-39.htm">Numbers 7:39</a> reminds us that worship involves giving God our best (the young bull), our strength (the ram), our purity (the year-old lamb), and our entire selves (the burnt offering). Each animal foreshadows Jesus, the perfect and final sacrifice, and each challenges us to live a life wholly offered to the Lord in gratitude and obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1438;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">young</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bull,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6499.htm">Strong's 6499: </a> </span><span class="str2">Young bull, steer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ram,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1447;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_352.htm">Strong's 352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, strong, a chief, a ram, a pilaster, an oak, strong tree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male lamb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1489;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ke&#183;&#7687;e&#347;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3532.htm">Strong's 3532: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a year old,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a burnt offering;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
