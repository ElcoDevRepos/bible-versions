Historically, the Israelites often faced threats from surrounding nations such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites. The land was a gift from God, promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), and defending it was both a physical and spiritual duty. The concept of "adversary" here can also be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, reflecting the ongoing battle between good and evil.<p><b>sound short blasts on the trumpets</b><br>The use of trumpets in Israel had both practical and symbolic significance. Trumpets were used for communication, signaling assembly, and directing movements (<a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-8</a>). The short blasts, or "teruah," were distinct from other trumpet sounds and were specifically for battle. Theologically, the trumpet blasts signified a call to divine intervention, reminding the Israelites of God's presence and power. Trumpets are also significant in eschatological contexts, such as the trumpet judgments in Revelation (Revelation 8-11).<p><b>and you will be remembered before the LORD your God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Being "remembered" by God implies His active involvement and favor. In the Old Testament, remembrance by God often leads to deliverance or blessing (<a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). It underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands as a means of invoking His protection and aid.<p><b>and saved from your enemies</b><br>The promise of salvation from enemies is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting God's role as a deliverer. This salvation is not just physical but also spiritual, pointing to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of God's promise to save His people from their sins (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>). The assurance of victory over enemies also foreshadows the final victory over sin and death through Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to prepare for battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversary.htm">Adversary</a></b><br>Any enemy or oppressor that comes against the Israelites in their own land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/trumpets.htm">Trumpets</a></b><br>Specifically, silver trumpets used by the priests to signal various events, including battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who promises to remember and deliver His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle_in_the_land.htm">Battle in the Land</a></b><br>Refers to conflicts that arise within the Promised Land, where the Israelites are to defend themselves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience.htm">The Role of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands, such as sounding the trumpets, is crucial for divine intervention and victory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_remembrance_and_deliverance.htm">Divine Remembrance and Deliverance</a></b><br>God promises to remember His people and deliver them when they call upon Him in times of distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites used trumpets in physical battles, Christians are called to use spiritual disciplines in spiritual warfare.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_leadership.htm">Community and Leadership</a></b><br>The role of the priests in sounding the trumpets highlights the importance of godly leadership and community in facing challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The act of sounding the trumpets is a demonstration of faith, trusting that God will act on behalf of His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_10_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_10_9_Seeking_God_s_help_in_battle.htm">How does Numbers 10:9 guide us in seeking God's help during battles?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_do_trumpets_remind_God_of_His_covenant.htm">What role do trumpets play in reminding God of His covenant with Israel?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_divine_remembrance_in_prayer.htm">How can we apply the principle of divine remembrance in our prayer life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_passages_on_God_s_deliverance.htm">What New Testament passages emphasize God's deliverance in times of trouble?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Add_communal_deliverance_prayer.htm">How can we incorporate communal prayer for deliverance in our church practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_10_9_and_divine_battle_aid.htm">How does Numbers 10:9 relate to the concept of divine intervention in battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Numbers_10_9_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Numbers 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Trumpets_in_Num_10_9_God_s_message.htm">How does the use of trumpets in Numbers 10:9 symbolize communication with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_rapture.htm">What does the Bible say about the Secret Rapture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_proverbs_9_10_align_with_secular_wisdom.htm">Proverbs 9:10 asserts 'the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.'

In your land. The practical use of the trumpets ceased with the years of wandering; the ceremonial use was continued as long as the people dwelt in "their land;" the spiritual use remains an "ordinance for ever," as long as the Church is militant here on earth. That the use of the two silver trumpets was ceremonial, and not practical, after the conquest of Canaan is evident from the purpose and effect ascribed to that use. Whether in war or in worship, that purpose was <span class="accented">not</span> to convoke the people, nor to give signals to the host, <span class="accented">but</span> to put God in mind of his promises, and to invoke his covenanted grace. Indeed, two trumpets, as here prescribed, could not be otherwise than ceremonially used after the nation was spread abroad over the whole face of Canaan; and there is no direction to make more than two such trumpets. The use of trumpets in subsequent times is indeed often mentioned both in war and in holy festivities, and it was undoubtedly founded upon this Divine ordinance; but it was not in literal compliance with it, for the obvious reason that many trumpets were used instead of two only (see <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>). In these passages (and probably in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>) we have abundant evidence of one of those expansions and adaptations of the Mosaic ritual which were so freely made under the house of David. Chapter 31:6, and (perhaps) <a href="/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>, and <a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a> may be quoted as pointing to the strict fulfillment of the law as it stands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
