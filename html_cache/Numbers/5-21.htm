This phrase indicates a formal and solemn procedure, where the woman is required to take an oath. The context is a ritual for determining the guilt or innocence of a woman suspected of adultery, known as the "ordeal of jealousy." The oath of the curse is a serious invocation, reflecting the gravity of the situation. Oaths were binding and sacred, often invoking divine judgment if broken. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of truth and fidelity in marriage, as well as the community's reliance on divine justice.<p><b>&#8216;then may the LORD make you an attested curse among your people</b><br>The invocation of the LORD's name signifies the seriousness of the curse. In ancient Israel, being a curse among one's people meant being publicly shamed and ostracized. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where individual actions affected the entire community. The phrase "attested curse" implies a visible and undeniable sign of divine judgment, serving as a warning to others. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are pronounced based on obedience to God's law. The communal aspect underscores the importance of maintaining purity and faithfulness within the covenant community.<p><b>by making your thigh shrivel and your belly swell.</b><br>The physical symptoms described are symbolic of divine judgment. The "thigh" and "belly" are euphemistic references to reproductive organs, indicating a curse on fertility and the ability to bear children. In the cultural context, fertility was highly valued, and barrenness was seen as a sign of divine disfavor. The specific symptoms serve as a tangible sign of guilt, contrasting with the blessings of health and prosperity promised to the obedient. This reflects the broader biblical theme of blessings and curses tied to covenant faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The physical manifestation of the curse also serves as a type of divine justice, prefiguring the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who bore the curse of sin on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A religious leader responsible for administering the oath and the ritual described in this passage.
