The timing at twilight, or evening, complements the morning sacrifice, creating a rhythm of worship that bookends the day. This practice underscores the continual need for atonement and dedication to God. The evening sacrifice is a reminder of the perpetual covenant between God and His people, symbolizing the need for constant vigilance in faith. The concept of offering at twilight can also be seen as a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often associated with the Lamb of God, offered once for all.<p><b>with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning</b><br>The grain and drink offerings accompanying the lamb are consistent with the morning sacrifice, emphasizing the uniformity and consistency in worship. The grain offering, often made of fine flour mixed with oil, represents the sustenance and provision from God, while the drink offering, typically wine, symbolizes joy and celebration in His presence. These offerings highlight the holistic nature of worship, involving both physical and spiritual elements. The repetition of these offerings in the evening mirrors the morning ritual, reinforcing the idea of completeness and total devotion to God throughout the day.<p><b>It is a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The concept of a "pleasing aroma" to the LORD is a recurring theme in the sacrificial system, indicating God's acceptance and satisfaction with the offering. This phrase suggests that the sacrifices are not merely ritualistic but are meant to be heartfelt acts of worship that bring delight to God. The idea of a pleasing aroma can be connected to the New Testament, where believers are called to be a "living sacrifice" (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), living lives that are pleasing to God. The sacrificial system, with its emphasis on a pleasing aroma, foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose offering of Himself was the ultimate pleasing aroma to God, fulfilling the requirements of the law and establishing a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices to maintain their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evening_sacrifice.htm">The Evening Sacrifice</a></b><br>A daily ritual offering made at twilight, symbolizing continual devotion and reliance on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who prescribed the sacrificial system as a means for His people to express worship and maintain fellowship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_worship.htm">Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>The daily offerings highlight the importance of regular, consistent worship and devotion to God.

Thus the evening lamb pointed ahead to the once-for-all sacrifice that permanently covers sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction is literal: priests actually placed a living lamb on the altar each evening (<a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>). Yet it also invites worshipers today to close every day mindful of Christ&#8217;s sufficiency (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning</b><p>&#8226; God required consistency: equal portions of fine flour mixed with oil (about 2 quarts) and a drink offering of wine (about 1 quart) both morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40-41</a>).<p>&#8226; Grain offering (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>) celebrated His daily provision&#8212;bread, life, sustenance.<p>&#8226; Drink offering symbolized joy and total consecration (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeating the exact measures twice a day underscored that God deserves undiminished honor regardless of the hour (<a href="/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ these elements find fuller meaning: He is the &#8220;Bread of Life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and His blood, pictured in wine, was &#8220;poured out for many&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).
