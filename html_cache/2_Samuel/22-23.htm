In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and devotion to God after being delivered from his enemies. The term "ordinances" refers to God's decrees and laws, which were given to the Israelites through Moses. This commitment to God's ordinances is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's law as a sign of faithfulness. In <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, the psalmist repeatedly speaks of delighting in God's laws and keeping them ever before him, illustrating a life centered around divine instruction.<p><b>I have not disregarded His statutes.</b><br>David's declaration of not disregarding God's statutes highlights his dedication to living according to God's will. The word "statutes" often refers to specific laws or decrees that require adherence. In the historical context, Israel was a theocratic society where the law of God was central to both religious and civil life. David's adherence to these statutes is significant, as it underscores his role as a king who seeks to lead by example in following God's commands. This commitment is also a foreshadowing of the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law completely. In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping God's commandments as a demonstration of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). David's faithfulness serves as a type of Christ, pointing to the ultimate obedience and righteousness found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's faithfulness and his own commitment to God's laws.
