The "Three" are the elite warriors among David's mighty men, known for their extraordinary feats of bravery and skill in battle. Abishai's recognition as being "more honored" suggests his exceptional valor and leadership, which earned him a distinguished reputation. This honor reflects the biblical principle that God exalts those who demonstrate faithfulness and courage. The comparison to the "Three" highlights the high regard in which Abishai was held, despite not being part of this elite group. This can be seen as a reminder of the biblical theme that God often elevates individuals based on their character and actions rather than their official status or title.<p><b>And he became their commander,</b><br>Abishai's role as a commander signifies his leadership abilities and the trust David placed in him. In the context of ancient Israel, military leadership was crucial for the survival and success of the nation. Abishai's appointment as a commander underscores his strategic acumen and ability to inspire and lead men in battle. This mirrors the biblical theme of God raising leaders who are capable of guiding His people through challenging times. Abishai's leadership can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate leader and commander of God's people, guiding them with wisdom and strength.<p><b>even though he was not included among the Three.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Abishai's achievements and leadership were recognized despite not being part of the most elite group of warriors. It highlights the biblical principle that one's worth and contribution are not solely determined by formal titles or positions. Abishai's story is a testament to the idea that God values faithfulness and service over status. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching that in the body of Christ, every member has a unique role and is honored for their contribution, regardless of their position. It also reflects the theme of God's grace, where He often chooses the unlikely or overlooked to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a></b><br>The verse refers to Abishai, the brother of Joab, who was a valiant warrior and a leader among David's mighty men.

David placed Abishai over the elite warriors, much as he later entrusted him with leading a division against the Ammonites (<a href="/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9&#8211;10</a>) and with a third of the army against Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links honor with greater stewardship (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>). Abishai&#8217;s promotion illustrates that God-given accomplishments equip a servant for broader leadership.<p>&#8226; His command did not diminish the Three; instead, it provided unified direction for the whole corps of mighty men, echoing the orderly structure God values (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even though he was not included among the Three</b><p>&#8226; Abishai&#8217;s role shows that status and service can differ.

The body of Christ likewise assigns differing functions while honoring every part (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Abishai&#8217;s story guards against envy: he celebrated his commission without resenting the distinct glory of the Three, modeling <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>, &#8220;Outdo one another in showing honor.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/23-19.htm">2 Samuel 23:19</a> highlights that Abishai&#8217;s extraordinary valor earned him unique honor, prompting David to appoint him commander over the mighty men. Though not one of the original Three, his faithfulness and achievements positioned him for leadership. The verse teaches that God-given honor stems from devoted service, that responsibility accompanies recognition, and that meaningful leadership is possible without holding the most prestigious title.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/23-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Was he not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">more honored</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7733;&#183;b&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3513.htm">Strong's 3513: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be heavy, weighty, or burdensome</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Three?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
