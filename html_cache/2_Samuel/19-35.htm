In biblical times, reaching the age of eighty was considered a significant milestone, often associated with wisdom and experience (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>). Barzillai's age suggests a life of accumulated knowledge and respect within his community. His age also implies a generational perspective, having witnessed the reigns of Saul and David, and the political and social changes in Israel.<p><b>Can I discern what is good and what is not?</b><br>Barzillai questions his ability to make sound judgments, a reflection of the diminishing faculties often associated with old age. This rhetorical question highlights the limitations that come with aging, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1-5</a>, where the Preacher describes the challenges of growing old. It also underscores the humility of Barzillai, acknowledging that his once sharp discernment may now be impaired, a contrast to the wisdom often attributed to elders in biblical culture.<p><b>Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks?</b><br>This phrase indicates a decline in Barzillai's physical senses, particularly taste, which is a common aspect of aging. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sharing meals was a significant social activity, and the ability to enjoy food and drink was a sign of vitality and blessing (<a href="/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>). Barzillai's admission suggests a loss of pleasure in one of life's basic enjoyments, emphasizing the physical decline that accompanies old age.<p><b>Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women?</b><br>Hearing was an important sense in ancient Israel, where oral tradition and music played crucial roles in worship and community life. Barzillai's question about his ability to hear singing reflects a loss of connection to these cultural and religious experiences. Music, especially in the form of psalms and hymns, was integral to Israelite worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This loss signifies a diminished participation in communal joy and spiritual expression.<p><b>Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?</b><br>Barzillai expresses concern about becoming a burden to King David, demonstrating humility and self-awareness. In the historical context, loyalty to the king was paramount, and Barzillai's support during Absalom's rebellion was significant. His reluctance to accompany David to Jerusalem reflects a desire not to impose on the king's resources or hospitality. This attitude aligns with the biblical principle of serving others selflessly (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>) and highlights Barzillai's character as a faithful and considerate servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barzillai_the_gileadite.htm">Barzillai the Gileadite</a></b><br>An elderly and wealthy man who supported King David during Absalom's rebellion.

Barzillai begins by stating his age, acknowledging the natural limitations that accompany a long life (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently treats old age as honorable (<a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>), yet it also concedes that strength fades (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; In context, Barzillai is explaining to David why he will not accompany the king to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; His self-awareness models humility: he knows the season God has given him and accepts its boundaries (<a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can I discern what is good and what is not?</b><p>&#8226; He questions his ability to render sound judgment, implying declining mental sharpness.<p>&#8226; Solomon later asks for &#8220;an understanding heart to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), underscoring that discernment is a God-given gift, not guaranteed by age alone.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a> notes that mature believers &#8220;through practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil,&#8221; yet Barzillai feels this faculty waning.<p>&#8226; His honesty teaches that spiritual and practical discernment must be exercised while we have strength (<a href="/psalms/119-66.htm">Psalm 119:66</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks?</b><p>&#8226; He laments the dulling of physical senses&#8212;an echo of <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>, where aging blunts sensory delight.<p>&#8226; David had supplied him earlier with abundant provisions (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27&#8211;29</a>); Barzillai now says he can no longer fully enjoy such royal fare.<p>&#8226; The statement reminds readers that earthly pleasures fade, but the goodness of God remains to be &#8220;tasted&#8221; by faith (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>), even when literal taste diminishes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women?</b><p>&#8226; Hearing loss is another sign of frailty (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The royal court&#8217;s music would bring no real benefit to ears that can scarcely perceive it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a> lists the silencing of musicians as a sign of judgment; here, the silence is personal, marking life&#8217;s twilight.<p>&#8226; Barzillai recognizes that the pageantry of Jerusalem would hold little meaning without the senses to appreciate it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?</b><p>&#8226; His concern shifts from personal limitation to David&#8217;s welfare.<p>&#8226; Rather than consume royal resources, he offers to let the younger Chimham go in his place (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle mirrors <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>&#8212;bear one another&#8217;s burdens&#8212;but Barzillai chooses not to shift his burden onto David.<p>&#8226; Jacob once voiced a similar concern to Esau about over-taxing flocks and children (<a href="/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13&#8211;14</a>), showing that considerate decline is a recurring biblical theme.<p>&#8226; Casting his own care on the LORD (<a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>), he trusts God to sustain him at home in Gilead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a> records Barzillai&#8217;s respectful refusal of David&#8217;s generous invitation. By itemizing the limitations of his eighty-year-old body&#8212;diminished discernment, taste, and hearing&#8212;he illustrates the biblical truth that life&#8217;s vigor is temporary. Rather than cling to earthly honor, he chooses contentment, seeks the king&#8217;s good, and entrusts the future to the next generation. The verse teaches humility, realism about aging, and a selfless desire not to burden others, all while affirming the faithfulness of God throughout every season of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I am</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
