Sackcloth, a coarse material, was traditionally used in times of mourning and repentance, indicating Rizpah's deep sorrow and lamentation. The act of spreading it on a rock suggests a makeshift shelter or a place of vigil, symbolizing her steadfastness and dedication. This scene takes place in the context of a famine in Israel, attributed to Saul's breach of a covenant with the Gibeonites, leading to the execution of Saul's descendants. Rizpah's actions reflect a mother's love and a plea for justice and dignity for the deceased.<p><b>From the beginning of the harvest until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies,</b><br>The timing from the beginning of the harvest until the rain signifies a prolonged period, likely several months, during which Rizpah maintained her vigil. The harvest marks a time of gathering and provision, contrasting with the desolation of the executed bodies. The rain from heaven is significant as it symbolizes divine intervention and the end of the famine, suggesting that God acknowledged the injustice and Rizpah's perseverance. This period also reflects the cultural and religious importance of proper burial rites in ancient Israel, which Rizpah sought for her sons.<p><b>she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</b><br>Rizpah's vigilance in protecting the bodies from scavengers underscores her devotion and the cultural imperative to honor the dead. In ancient Near Eastern culture, exposure of bodies was a sign of disgrace, and preventing this was an act of respect and love. Her actions can be seen as a form of protest against the injustice done to her sons and a plea for their proper burial. This phrase also echoes the biblical theme of divine protection and care, as seen in other scriptures where God shields His people from harm. Rizpah's unwavering commitment serves as a poignant reminder of the power of maternal love and the quest for justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rizpah.htm">Rizpah</a></b><br>The daughter of Aiah and a concubine of King Saul.

Here, the land is under a famine (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>), so the mention of harvest accentuates the nation&#8217;s need for divine favor.<p>&#8226; Rizpah&#8217;s vigil commences at a season when Israel normally celebrated God&#8217;s provision, but now they face the consequences of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies</b><p>&#8226; Rain in the former drought-stricken land signals God has accepted the atonement and ended the famine (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The length of Rizpah&#8217;s watch stretches from early spring to the first autumn rains&#8212;several months&#8212;demonstrating extraordinary perseverance.<p>&#8226; Her endurance mirrors Noah&#8217;s waiting for the floodwaters to recede (<a href="/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6-12</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s repeated prayers for rain (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a> commands that an executed man&#8217;s body not remain on a tree overnight; Rizpah&#8217;s actions fulfill the spirit of that law when the nation had not.<p>&#8226; Preventing scavengers preserves the dignity of the dead, anticipating God&#8217;s promise that His faithful ones will not see ultimate decay (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Her daytime vigilance underscores the mother&#8217;s protective instinct, reminiscent of the shepherd who drives predators away (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor the beasts of the field by night</b><p>&#8226; Nighttime danger intensifies the sacrifice; like the Psalmist who blesses &#8220;the LORD who watches over Israel&#8230; neither slumbers nor sleeps&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>), Rizpah stays awake through dark hours.<p>&#8226; The detail recalls Abraham defending his covenant sacrifice from birds of prey (<a href="/genesis/15-11.htm">Genesis 15:11</a>)&#8212;another scene where guarding a covenantal moment mattered.<p>&#8226; By keeping vigil both day and night, she models patient faith that waits for God&#8217;s righteous resolution (<a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Rizpah&#8217;s months-long vigil atop a rock in sackcloth vividly portrays relentless motherly love, respect for God&#8217;s law, and implicit faith that the Lord would send rain and lift judgment. Her act guards the dignity of the dead, fulfills divine commands neglected by others, and ultimately prompts David to provide a proper burial (<a href="/2_samuel/21-11.htm">2 Samuel 21:11-14</a>). The account reminds believers that steadfast, sacrificial devotion can move leaders to righteousness and invite God&#8217;s restorative blessing on His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rizpah ... took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock;</span> rather, <span class="accented">against the rock</span>, so as to form a little hut or shelter to protect her from the glaring blaze of the sunshine. The word "upon" has led many commentators to suppose that she used it as a bed; but this is not the meaning of the Hebrew, though given by the Vulgate. The sackcloth was the loose wrapper or cloak which formed the outer dress of mourners. As regards the bodies of those crucified or impaled, the Law required that they should be taken down and buried that same evening (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). Here they remained exposed for six months, as a grim trophy of Gibeonite vengeance. <span class="cmt_word">Until water dropped upon them out of heaven;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">was poured upon them</span>; until copious and heavy rains came. The outpouring of these rains would put an end to the famine, and be regarded as a proof that the wrath of Heaven was appeased. There is no reason for supposing that these rains came before the usual period, in autumn, which was about the middle of October. Thus, for six months, with no other protection than her mantle of sackcloth hung against the rock, this noble woman watched the decaying bodies of her loved ones, until at last her devoted conduct touched David's heart, and their remains were honourably interred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Rizpah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(ri&#7779;&#183;p&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7532.htm">Strong's 7532: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rizpah -- concubine of Saul</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the daughter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Aiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ay&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_345.htm">Strong's 345: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aiah -- 'falcon', the name of a Horite, also of an Israelite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
