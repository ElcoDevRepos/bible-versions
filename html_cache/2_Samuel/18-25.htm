This reflects the ancient practice of using watchmen to keep an eye on the horizon for messengers or potential threats. The role of a watchman is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing vigilance and readiness, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>, where God appoints Ezekiel as a watchman for Israel.<p><b>&#8220;If he is alone,&#8221; the king replied,</b><br>King David's response indicates his experience and understanding of military communication. In ancient times, a single runner often signified a message of importance, as opposed to a group which might indicate an approaching threat or army. This reflects David's wisdom and discernment, qualities that are highlighted throughout his reign.<p><b>&#8220;he bears good news.&#8221;</b><br>The expectation of good news from a lone runner is rooted in the cultural and historical context of the time. In <a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>, the news of Saul's death was brought by a single Amalekite, which was initially perceived as good news for David. This phrase also foreshadows the Gospel, the "Good News" of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate messenger bringing salvation to humanity.<p><b>As the first runner drew near,</b><br>The approach of the runner signifies the imminent delivery of news, creating a sense of anticipation. This moment is pivotal, as it will reveal the outcome of the battle between David's forces and those of his son Absalom. The anticipation of news is a recurring theme in the Bible, such as the anticipation of the Messiah in the Old Testament, fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/watchman.htm">Watchman</a></b><br>A sentinel stationed to observe and report any approaching individuals or events.

And quickly the foremost is recognized by his running as the son of the high priest, and David is then assured that all has gone well, because Joab would not have sent a man of such rank to be the bearer of bad news. The word <span class="cmt_word">good</span> may also mean that Ahimaaz was too brave a man to have fled from the battle, and must, therefore, have come on an errand from Joab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;p&#772;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
