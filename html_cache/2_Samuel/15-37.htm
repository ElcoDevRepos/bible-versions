His loyalty is significant in the narrative of David's reign, especially during Absalom's rebellion. The term "friend" here implies a close confidant, someone who is trusted with intimate counsel. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such a role was crucial for a king, as it provided both personal support and strategic advice. Hushai's loyalty contrasts with Ahithophel, another advisor who betrays David. This relationship can be seen as a type of Christ's relationship with His disciples, where loyalty and betrayal are key themes.<p><b>arrived in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the city of David, holds immense historical and theological significance. It is the political and spiritual center of Israel. Hushai's arrival in Jerusalem is strategic, as it positions him to counteract Absalom's rebellion from within the city. Archaeological evidence supports Jerusalem's status as a fortified city during this period, making it a critical location for controlling the kingdom. Theologically, Jerusalem is often seen as a symbol of God's chosen place, which adds weight to the events unfolding there.<p><b>just as Absalom was entering the city</b><br>Absalom's entry into Jerusalem marks a pivotal moment in his rebellion against his father, King David. This timing is crucial, as it sets the stage for the ensuing conflict and the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy regarding the sword never departing from David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>). Absalom's rebellion can be seen as a consequence of David's earlier sins, reflecting the biblical theme of reaping what one sows. The tension between Absalom and David also mirrors the broader biblical narrative of conflict between God's chosen leaders and those who seek power through rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai.htm">Hushai</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David.
