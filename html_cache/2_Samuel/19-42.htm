The men of Judah are responding to the men of Israel, indicating a dialogue that reflects underlying tensions. Historically, the tribes of Israel were often divided, with Judah and Benjamin forming the southern kingdom and the other tribes forming the northern kingdom. This division is significant in understanding the later split of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12).<p><b>&#8220;We did this because the king is our relative.</b><br>The men of Judah claim a closer kinship to King David, as he was from the tribe of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>). This familial connection is used to justify their actions and loyalty. The emphasis on kinship ties reflects the cultural importance of family and tribal affiliations in ancient Israel. This also foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom, where tribal loyalties play a crucial role.<p><b>Why does this anger you?</b><br>This rhetorical question addresses the jealousy and rivalry between the tribes. The men of Judah are questioning the motives of the men of Israel, suggesting that their anger is unfounded. This tension can be seen as a precursor to the later conflicts between the northern and southern kingdoms. It also reflects the human tendency towards envy and division, themes addressed throughout Scripture (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p><b>Have we ever eaten at the king&#8217;s expense</b><br>This phrase suggests that the men of Judah are defending their integrity and loyalty to David. They claim not to have taken advantage of their relationship with the king for personal gain. This can be seen as a reflection of the biblical principle of stewardship and integrity, where leaders and followers are called to act justly and without selfish ambition (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p><b>or received anything for ourselves?&#8221;</b><br>The men of Judah assert that their actions were not motivated by personal gain. This statement underscores the theme of selflessness and loyalty, which are valued traits in biblical narratives. It also highlights the importance of serving others without expecting rewards, a principle exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The tribe of Judah, from which King David hails, is defending their actions in bringing David back to Jerusalem after Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>Representatives from the other tribes of Israel who feel slighted by Judah's actions and express their displeasure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this account, whose return to power is the subject of contention between Judah and the other tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>The backdrop of this event, where David's son Absalom had previously usurped the throne, leading to a civil conflict.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city and the focal point of David's return to kingship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Just as the tribes of Israel were divided, the church today can face divisions.
