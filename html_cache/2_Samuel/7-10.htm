Historically, this refers to the land of Canaan, which was promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). Theologically, it signifies God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises. The concept of "place" also foreshadows the eternal rest and security found in the Kingdom of God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God dwells with His people.<p><b>and will plant them</b><br>The imagery of planting suggests stability and growth. In biblical times, planting was a metaphor for establishing a nation or people securely (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-11</a>). This phrase indicates God's intention to root Israel firmly in their land, ensuring their prosperity and continuity. It also points to the spiritual planting of believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>, where believers are "rooted and built up in Him."<p><b>so that they may dwell in a place of their own</b><br>This emphasizes the idea of ownership and belonging. For the Israelites, it meant having a secure and sovereign nation, free from foreign domination. Spiritually, it reflects the believer's identity and inheritance in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, where believers have obtained an inheritance.<p><b>and be disturbed no more</b><br>This promise of peace and security contrasts with Israel's history of conflict and exile. It anticipates a time when God's people will live without fear of invasion or oppression. This peace is ultimately fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom, where Christ reigns as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them</b><br>This phrase addresses the cessation of oppression by foreign powers or internal corruption. Historically, Israel faced numerous oppressors, from the Egyptians to the Philistines. Theologically, it points to the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-25</a>).<p><b>as they did at the beginning</b><br>This refers to the early history of Israel, marked by slavery in Egypt and subsequent struggles during the period of the Judges. It serves as a reminder of God's deliverance and the hope of a future free from such oppression. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption, where God consistently rescues His people from bondage, culminating in the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker of the promise, emphasizing His sovereignty and faithfulness in establishing a secure place for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, recipient of God's covenant promise, which includes the establishment of a secure dwelling for Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are promised a secure and undisturbed dwelling place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_wickedness.htm">Sons of Wickedness</a></b><br>Represents the enemies and oppressors of Israel, who will no longer disturb them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The physical location where God intends to plant His people securely.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as seen in His covenant with David and Israel.

The Lord says that He had now given His people rest under David, not allowing "the children of wickedness to afflict them any more as before time," when they were in Egypt, nor as in the troubled period of the judges, "since the time that I commanded judges," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover I will appoint... will plant.</span> For "moreover," the Hebrew has "and." The tenses also continue the same: "And I have appointed... and have planted." It is all part of the same act. As regards the second verb, the past tense alone makes sense. Jehovah was not about to plant Israel in a place of their own, but had just done so completely. For David's kingdom had given them security, and with it the power of doing for God that duty which was Israel's special office in the world. Had the anarchy of the times of the judges continued, and the energies of the nation been spent in a hard struggle for existence, that rapid advance in literature which followed upon the institution of Samuel's schools, and which filled David's court with poets and chroniclers, never could have existed, and prophecy would have been impossible. The age of Hezekiah was apparently the culminating period of Hebrew civilization, after which came the depressing influences of the Assyrian invasions, and then long exile, followed by a second weary struggle for existence. If writing was at first a mystery and an art known only to priests, it became throughout the monarchy the possession especially of the prophets, who were Israel's learned men. At the head of their roll stands the matchless Isaiah, and to render it possible for his genius to display itself, not only Samuel's schools, but the security of David's era of conquest, and the long peace and magnificence of Solomon's reign, were all necessary. When "God had given David rest from his enemies round about," he had thereby finally appointed a place for Israel and had planted them there. There is, perhaps, some difficulty in the verb forms at the end of ver. 11, but none in the meaning. The reign of David marks an era in the national life. Under him Israel obtained secure possession of the place appointed for it; and now, having no longer to waste its energies in perpetual fighting, the national life grows upwards, and attains to culture, to thought, and civilization. Canaan is now their own, and instead of being mere warriors, they develop national institutions and a national character. What could men do that belongs to a higher and nobler life who were in daily fear of being swept away by Canaanites and Midianites, by Philistines and Ammonites?
