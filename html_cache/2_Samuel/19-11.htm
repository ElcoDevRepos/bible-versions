Zadok and Abiathar were loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion, serving as intermediaries between the king and the people. This reflects the role of priests as mediators, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Say to the elders of Judah:</b><br>The elders of Judah were leaders within the tribe, responsible for governance and decision-making. David's appeal to them underscores the tribal structure of ancient Israel, where each tribe had its own leadership. Judah, being David's own tribe, held a special place in his reign, and their support was crucial for his return to power. This tribal loyalty foreshadows the messianic prophecy that the Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>).<p><b>Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace:</b><br>David's question to the elders of Judah is both a challenge and a call to action. It implies a sense of urgency and expectation for them to lead in restoring him as king. This reflects the cultural importance of honor and loyalty in ancient Israel. The restoration of the king can be seen as a type of Christ's return, where believers are called to prepare and anticipate His coming (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).<p><b>Since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters:</b><br>The phrase indicates that the sentiment of the nation was in favor of David's return, suggesting a widespread recognition of his rightful kingship. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's chosen leader being acknowledged by the people, as seen in the acknowledgment of Jesus as King by those who recognized His divine authority (<a href="/john/12-12.htm">John 12:12-15</a>).

It had shown especial ingratitude to David, and had formed the cradle and centre of the rebellion, and even now Jerusalem probably had a garrison of Absalom's soldiers. They might naturally doubt how they would be received, and their military organisation in Absalom's interest threw especial obstacles in their way. The last words of the verse, "to his house," may be an accidental repetition from the previous clause.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar.</span> The two high priests had remained behind at Jerusalem, to watch over David's interests, and he now, by a messenger, probably Ahimaaz or Jonathan, urges them to quicken the proceedings of his own tribe. We may feel quite sure that there was discussion in Judah as well as in the other tribes; but the rebellion had begun at Hebron, and probably many of the leading chiefs were deeply implicated in Absalom's proceedings. Probably they now regretted it, but hung back through fear of punishment.
