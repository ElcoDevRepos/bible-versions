Tyre was known for its strong fortifications and its role as a center of trade and commerce in the ancient world. The city's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast made it a key player in regional politics and economics. In biblical prophecy, Tyre is often depicted as a symbol of pride and wealth (<a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28:1-19</a>). The journey toward Tyre in this context underscores the extensive nature of the census being conducted, reaching even the influential and fortified areas.<p><b>and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites</b><br>The Hivites and Canaanites were among the original inhabitants of the land before the Israelites' conquest. The Hivites are mentioned in several places in the Old Testament, often associated with the central and northern regions of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>). The Canaanites, a broader term, refers to various groups living in the land of Canaan. This phrase indicates the comprehensive scope of the census, covering diverse ethnic groups and regions. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan, despite the presence of these peoples (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah, to Beersheba</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in the southern part of Israel, known for its arid climate and sparse population. Beersheba, located in the Negev, holds historical and spiritual significance as a patriarchal site. It is associated with figures like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who had significant encounters with God there (<a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31-33</a>, <a href="/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23-25</a>). The mention of Beersheba marks the southernmost point of the land traditionally considered part of Israel, often used in the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" to denote the entire territory of Israel (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>).

Tyre&#8217;s mention underlines the literal expanse of Israel&#8217;s influence at this moment in history, proving God&#8217;s faithfulness to broaden David&#8217;s borders as in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites</b><p>&#8226;

The verse affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness in granting Israel secure borders and fulfills the scriptural promise that the kingdom would stretch &#8220;from the river of Egypt to the Great River, the Euphrates&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites.</span>--The remnants of the original inhabitants appear still to have occupied distinct towns by themselves.

"The Canaanites" is a general name for the remnants of all the other races.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyre</span> (comp. <a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>). Tyre and the whole coast land between it and Sidon had been too strong for the tribe of Asher, and remained unsubdued. But, like the independent states in India, it acknowlodged the supremacy of the paramount power. <span class="cmt_word">The cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites.</span> It is evident from this that even in David's time there were towns and districts were Hivites and Canaanites dwelt as distinct communities, governed probably by their own laws. But as they were bound to serve in the Israelite armies, they were included in the census, and possibly one of its rosin objects was to learn the number of fighting men of alien races dwelling in Israel. They seem to have been reckoned as belonging to the tribe in whose borders they dwelt. So Baanah and Rechab, the murderers of Ishbosheth, though Beerothites (and therefore Gibeonites, who again were Hivites), were counted to Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>). These Gentile communities were chiefly to be found in the north, for which reason it was called "the circuit (<span class="accented">Gelil</span>) of the nations" (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>), and in later times from <span class="accented">Gelil</span> came the name Galilee. The Syriac adds "Jebusites," and we find Jerusalem occupied by a community of Jebusites living in independence in the very neighbourhood of the warlike tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). This numbering of the aborigines by David is referred to in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where it is added that Solomon made a separate census of them, and found that there were in Israel no fewer than a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred of these aliens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
