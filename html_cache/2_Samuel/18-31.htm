His role as a messenger highlights the diverse makeup of David's army and administration, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The arrival of the Cushite at this moment underscores the urgency and importance of the message he carries.<p><b>&#8220;May my lord the king hear the good news:</b><br>The phrase "good news" is significant in biblical narratives, often associated with victory or divine intervention. In this context, it refers to the outcome of the battle against Absalom, David's son, who had rebelled against him. The use of "good news" here is ironic, as the message is bittersweet for David, who must reconcile the victory with the personal loss of his son. This duality reflects the complexity of God's justice and mercy, themes prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>Today the LORD has avenged you</b><br>The concept of divine vengeance is central to the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as a warrior who fights on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The Cushite attributes the victory to the LORD, emphasizing that it is not merely a military success but a fulfillment of divine justice. This aligns with the biblical principle that vengeance belongs to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>), reinforcing the idea that David's kingship is under divine authority.<p><b>of all who rose up against you!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "all who rose up against you" refers to Absalom and his followers, who sought to usurp David's throne. This rebellion is a manifestation of the ongoing struggle between God's anointed and those who oppose His will, a theme that echoes throughout Scripture. The defeat of Absalom's forces can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as Jesus, the Son of David, triumphs over all spiritual adversaries (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cushite.htm">Cushite</a></b><br>A messenger from Cush, an ancient region in Africa, often associated with Ethiopia.
