The clan, or extended family, often acted as a governing body, making decisions on behalf of its members. This phrase indicates a collective decision or pressure from the clan, highlighting the communal nature of justice and responsibility. The term "maidservant" suggests a position of vulnerability and dependence, emphasizing the woman's plea for mercy and protection.<p><b>and said, &#8216;Hand over the one who struck down his brother,</b><br>This reflects the principle of lex talionis, or the law of retribution, which was prevalent in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel. The demand for the offender to be handed over aligns with the biblical concept of justice, where the family of a murder victim had the right to seek retribution. This is seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>, which discusses the role of the avenger of blood.<p><b>that we may put him to death for the life of the brother whom he killed.</b><br>The demand for capital punishment underscores the seriousness of murder in biblical law. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> establishes the principle that whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed, reflecting the sanctity of life. This phrase also highlights the tension between justice and mercy, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>Then we will cut off the heir as well!&#8217;</b><br>The concern for cutting off the heir reflects the importance of lineage and inheritance in Israelite society. The loss of an heir meant the end of a family line, which was a significant social and economic issue. This connects to the biblical emphasis on preserving family names and inheritance, as seen in laws regarding levirate marriage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>).<p><b>So they would extinguish my one remaining ember</b><br>The metaphor of an "ember" signifies the last hope or remnant of a family line. In a cultural context where family continuity was vital, the extinction of a family line was a grave concern. This imagery is poignant, evoking the idea of a dying fire, which is also used in other biblical passages to describe the end of a lineage or hope (<a href="/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5-6</a>).<p><b>by not preserving my husband&#8217;s name or posterity on the earth.&#8221;</b><br>Preserving a husband's name and posterity was a key aspect of Israelite culture, tied to the covenant promises of land and descendants. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The plea for preservation of the family line also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on spiritual inheritance and the eternal family of God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman from Tekoa, sent by Joab to King David to present a parable-like account to persuade him to reconcile with his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who orchestrates the plan to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem by using the woman of Tekoa to appeal to David's sense of justice and mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is dealing with the aftermath of his son Absalom's murder of his brother Amnon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who killed his brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of their sister Tamar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_clan.htm">The Clan</a></b><br>Represents the family or community seeking justice for the murder, highlighting the tension between justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_balance_of_justice_and_mercy.htm">The Balance of Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The account illustrates the tension between upholding justice and extending mercy.

While the law upholds capital punishment for murder, the clan&#8217;s demand extends beyond justice into vengeance, ignoring biblical provisions for due process and the protection of the innocent remainder of a family. By highlighting the extinction of her &#8220;one remaining ember,&#8221; the verse underscores God&#8217;s heart to defend the vulnerable and preserve covenant legacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">We will destroy the heir also.</span>--The woman puts this into the mouth of the family, because this would be the result of what they proposed. The effect of the parable is greatly heightened by this, and there is no doubt intended a covert allusion to Absalom as the heir of David.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The whole family.</span> This does not mean the kinsfolk, in whom such a disregard of the mother's feelings would have been cruel, but one of the great divisions of the tribe (see note on the <span class="accented">mishpachah</span>, in <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>, and comp. <a href="/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a>). In ver. 15 she rightly calls them "the people." We have thus a glimpse of the ordinary method of administering the criminal law, and find that each portion of a tribe exercised justice within its own district, being summoned to a general convention by its hereditary chief; and in this case the widow represents it as determined to punish the crime of fratricide with inflexible severity, and we may assume that such was the usual practice. The mother sets before David the other side of the matter - her own loneliness, the wiping out of the father's house, the utter ruin of her home if the last live coal on her hearth be extinguished. And in this way she moves his generous sympathies even to the point of overriding the legal rights of the mishpachah. In modern communities there is always some formal power of softening or entirely remitting penalties required by the letter of the law, and of taking into consideration matters of equity and even of feeling, Which the judge must put aside; and in monarchies this is always the high prerogative of the crown. <span class="cmt_word">And we will destroy the heir also.</span> The Syriac has the third person, "And they will destroy even the heir, and quench my coal that is left." This is more natural, but there is greater pungency in the widow putting into the mouth of the heads of the clan, not words which they had actually spoken, but words which showed what would be the real effect of their determination. There is great force and beauty also in the description of her son as the last live coal left to keep the family hearth burning. In another but allied sense David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, marg.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
