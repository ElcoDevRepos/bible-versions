David's reputation as a formidable leader and warrior was well-known throughout Israel. His men, often referred to as "David's mighty men," were elite warriors who had proven themselves in numerous battles. This acknowledgment of their prowess serves to remind Absalom of the potential danger in underestimating them. The phrase also highlights the loyalty and skill of David's followers, which is a recurring theme in the narrative of David's life.<p><b>They are mighty men,</b><br>The term "mighty men" refers to David's elite group of warriors, known as the "Gibborim." These men were renowned for their strength, bravery, and loyalty. They are detailed in passages such as <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>, where their heroic deeds are recounted. This group included individuals like Josheb-Basshebeth, Eleazar, and Shammah, who performed extraordinary feats in battle. Their reputation would have been a significant psychological factor in any military engagement.<p><b>and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs.</b><br>This simile emphasizes the ferocity and determination of David and his men. A bear robbed of her cubs is known for its aggressive and relentless nature, symbolizing the potential wrath and tenacity of David's forces. This imagery is used to convey the idea that David's men would fight with intense passion and desperation, making them formidable opponents. The use of such vivid imagery would have been a powerful rhetorical tool to instill caution in Absalom.<p><b>Moreover, your father is a man of war</b><br>David's identity as a "man of war" is well-established throughout the biblical narrative. From his victory over Goliath to his numerous military campaigns, David demonstrated strategic acumen and combat prowess. His experience and success in warfare were unmatched, making him a respected and feared military leader. This acknowledgment serves to remind Absalom of David's capability to outmaneuver and outfight his enemies.<p><b>who will not spend the night with the troops.</b><br>This phrase suggests David's strategic wisdom and caution. By not spending the night with the troops, David would avoid potential surprise attacks and maintain an element of unpredictability. This tactic reflects his understanding of warfare and his ability to adapt to changing circumstances. It also indicates his leadership style, which involved making calculated decisions to protect himself and his men. This strategic thinking is consistent with David's character throughout the biblical narrative, where he often seeks divine guidance and employs clever tactics to achieve victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David, who infiltrated Absalom's court to counteract the counsel of Ahithophel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and deep relationship with God.
