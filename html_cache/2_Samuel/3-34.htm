In ancient Near Eastern culture, binding the hands and feet was a common practice for captives or criminals. Abner, however, was neither a captive nor a criminal; he was a respected military leader and a key figure in the unification of Israel under David. His unbound state signifies that he was not subdued by force or legal means, but rather treacherously murdered. This reflects the broader biblical theme of unjust suffering, reminiscent of Jesus Christ, who was also innocent yet suffered at the hands of the wicked.<p><b>As a man falls before the wicked, so also you fell.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the treachery and betrayal involved in Abner's death. Joab, who killed Abner, acted out of personal vendetta rather than justice. The phrase "falls before the wicked" suggests a sense of helplessness and victimization, drawing a parallel to other biblical figures who suffered unjustly, such as Abel at the hands of Cain. It also foreshadows the ultimate betrayal and fall of Jesus Christ, who was delivered into the hands of sinners despite His innocence.<p><b>And all the people wept over him even more.</b><br>The communal mourning for Abner indicates his importance and the respect he commanded among the people. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, public mourning was a significant expression of grief and solidarity. This collective lamentation reflects the nation's recognition of the loss of a great leader and the injustice of his death. It also mirrors the mourning seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the weeping over Lazarus in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, and anticipates the sorrow of the disciples at the crucifixion of Christ. The people's response underscores the gravity of the situation and the impact of Abner's death on the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>A prominent military leader in Israel, Abner was the commander of Saul's army and later aligned himself with David.

The passage challenges believers to uphold justice, resist personal vengeance, and mourn all innocent bloodshed, knowing God will ultimately right every wrong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Thy hands were not bound.</span>--The people were moved greatly by the sight of David's sorrow, but still more by this brief elegy over Abner. The whole circumstances are summed up in a few pregnant words: Abner, so valiant in war, with his hands free for defence, with his feet unfettered, unsuspicious of evil, fell by the treacherous act of a wicked man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy hands were not bound.</span> Abner had been put to death by Joab for killing Asahel. But there had been no legal process. He had not been brought in fetters before a judge to be tried for the crime alleged, but murdered for private ends. And thus, "As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so had he fallen," that is, by crime, and not by law. These words s re probably the refrain of the dirge, like those in <a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19, 25, 27</a>, and were followed by the celebration of Abner's bravery, but they alone are recorded, because they contain the main point. Abner's death was not, like the sentence upon Baanah and Rechab, an act of justice, but one of lawless revenge; and by this poem David proclaimed, not only his innocence, but also his abhorrence of the crime. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your hands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1443;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
