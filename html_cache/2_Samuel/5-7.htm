In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>, the Jebusites, who inhabited Jerusalem, were confident that David could not conquer their stronghold. Despite their confidence and the natural defenses of the city, David's success demonstrates God's providence and the fulfillment of His promises to David.<p><b>David captured</b><br>David's capture of Jerusalem marks a significant moment in his reign. It signifies the unification of the tribes of Israel under his leadership. David's military prowess and strategic acumen are evident here, as he successfully takes a city that had resisted conquest for centuries. This victory also fulfills God's promise to David of establishing his kingdom.<p><b>the fortress of Zion</b><br>Zion refers to the fortified hill in Jerusalem, which was a stronghold of the Jebusites. The term "Zion" later becomes synonymous with Jerusalem and, in a broader sense, the entire nation of Israel. Theologically, Zion holds significant importance as it becomes the spiritual and political center of Israel. It is often used in prophetic literature to symbolize God's presence and His future kingdom.<p><b>(that is, the City of David)</b><br>The City of David refers to the area of Jerusalem that David established as his capital. This designation highlights David's role in transforming Jerusalem into the political and spiritual heart of Israel. The City of David becomes a symbol of Davidic kingship and God's covenant with David, which is further elaborated in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. This area is also significant in biblical archaeology, as excavations have uncovered structures dating back to David's time, providing historical validation of the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his military prowess.

The total area of the hill top was about sixty acres, and it was now quickly covered with houses, and called "the city of David," after its captor. The view of Dr. Birch and others, that the stronghold of Zion was Ophel, is rendered untenable by the fact that this southern tongue of Mount Moriah is completely commanded by other parts of the hill. According to Gesenius, Zion means "sunny;" others render it "the dry hill;" others, "lofty;" and Furst, "the castle." None of these derivations is of any real value, as the word is probably Hittite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless, David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">captured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;k&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
