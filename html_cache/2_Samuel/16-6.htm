In ancient Near Eastern cultures, stoning was a method of execution for serious crimes, indicating the severity of Shimei's disdain for David. This event occurs during Absalom's rebellion, a time of great turmoil for David, who is fleeing Jerusalem. The act of throwing stones can also be seen as a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God declares that calamity will rise against David from within his own house.<p><b>and at all the servants of the king</b><br>Shimei's actions are not only directed at David but also at his loyal followers. This reflects the widespread discontent and division within the kingdom during Absalom's rebellion. The servants represent those who remain faithful to David despite the political upheaval. This moment highlights the tension between loyalty to the anointed king and the rising support for Absalom.<p><b>though the troops and all the mighty men</b><br>David's mighty men were renowned warriors, a formidable force that had been with him through many battles. Their presence underscores the audacity of Shimei's actions, as he risks his life by confronting such a powerful group. This also illustrates the restraint shown by David and his men, as they do not retaliate against Shimei's provocation, reflecting David's humility and trust in God's justice.<p><b>were on David&#8217;s right and left</b><br>The positioning of the troops and mighty men on David's right and left signifies their readiness to protect him. In biblical symbolism, the right hand often represents strength and favor, while the left can denote support. This imagery emphasizes the protection and loyalty surrounding David, even in his time of distress. It also foreshadows the ultimate protection and deliverance that God provides to His anointed, paralleling the protection offered to Jesus Christ by His followers and the angels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.
