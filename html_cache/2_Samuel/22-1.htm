This phrase highlights his practice of expressing gratitude and worship through song, a common form of worship in ancient Israel. The act of singing to the LORD reflects a personal and communal tradition of praising God, seen throughout the Psalms. David's songs often served as a means to communicate his relationship with God, expressing both personal and national experiences.<p><b>on the day the LORD had delivered him</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific moment of divine intervention and deliverance. In the biblical narrative, God frequently delivers His people from peril, emphasizing His role as a protector and savior. The concept of deliverance is central to the biblical story, often foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. David's acknowledgment of God's deliverance underscores his dependence on divine help rather than his own strength.<p><b>from the hand of all his enemies</b><br>David faced numerous adversaries throughout his life, including foreign nations and internal threats. This phrase suggests a comprehensive victory over all those who sought his harm. The "hand" symbolizes power and control, indicating that God has removed the power of David's enemies. This deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where believers are delivered from spiritual enemies.<p><b>and from the hand of Saul.</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, became David's primary adversary due to jealousy and fear of losing his throne. The conflict between Saul and David is a significant narrative in 1 Samuel, illustrating themes of divine anointing, human jealousy, and God's sovereignty. Saul's pursuit of David forced him into exile, yet David consistently refrained from harming Saul, respecting him as God's anointed. This deliverance from Saul's hand marks a turning point in David's life, leading to his eventual kingship. It also reflects the biblical principle of God's timing and justice, as well as the importance of trusting in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the King of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God, his military prowess, and his poetic contributions to the Bible, including many Psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the deliverer and protector of David.

His pattern echoes Moses after the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a> &#8220;Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD&#8221;).

The verse invites every believer to echo David: respond quickly, sing boldly, credit God completely, and remember that the same Lord still rescues His people today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David spake.</span> The introduction was probably written by the prophet who compiled the Books of Samuel. The scribe who collected the Book of Psalms would be a priest, and he has repeated it with one or two additions, the most important of which is that the psalm was written "by David the servant of Jehovah." This title; meaning the minister or vicegerent of Jehovah, is one so high that it would certainly not have been given to David in his lifetime; nor was it even until Moses was dead that he was honoured with this rank (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>). But what was David's right to this title, which put him on a level with Moses? It was this: In adding to the sacrificial ritual enacted by Moses a daily service in the temple of sacred minstrelsy and songs, David was acting with higher powers than were ever exercised by any other person. For though, as we have seen, Samuel was the originator of these services in his schools, yet. there is a wide difference between private and public services; and David made his anthems part of the national liturgy. But it would only be when the halo of long use had gathered round his holy psalmody that David would be placed on in equality with Moses, and his authority a institute a new ritual for the nation be recognized. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sang</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
