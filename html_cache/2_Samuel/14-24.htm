David's role as king is central to the narrative of 2 Samuel, where he is depicted as a ruler who must balance justice and mercy. The context here is David's struggle with familial loyalty and the demands of kingship, reflecting the tension between personal relationships and public duty.<p><b>&#8220;He may return to his house</b><br>Absalom had been in exile after killing his brother Amnon, who had raped their sister Tamar. David's decision to allow Absalom to return to his house in Jerusalem signifies a partial reconciliation. This act of allowing Absalom back into the city can be seen as a step towards forgiveness, yet it is incomplete. The return to his house symbolizes a restoration of Absalom's status, but not a full restoration of his relationship with David.<p><b>but he must not see my face.&#8221;</b><br>David's stipulation that Absalom must not see his face indicates a continued estrangement. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeing the king's face was a sign of favor and acceptance. By denying Absalom this privilege, David is withholding full reconciliation and maintaining a distance. This reflects the unresolved tension and the consequences of Absalom's actions, highlighting the theme of justice and the cost of sin.<p><b>So Absalom returned to his own house</b><br>Absalom's return to his own house marks a physical return to Jerusalem but not a relational one with his father. This separation within proximity underscores the fractured nature of their relationship. It also sets the stage for Absalom's future actions, as his return to Jerusalem becomes a pivotal moment leading to his rebellion against David.<p><b>but he did not see the face of the king.</b><br>The repetition of Absalom not seeing David's face emphasizes the ongoing estrangement. This lack of direct communication and reconciliation foreshadows the eventual conflict between father and son. It serves as a narrative device to highlight the consequences of unresolved familial conflict and the importance of true reconciliation. This situation can be contrasted with the reconciliation offered through Christ, who restores believers to a right relationship with God, symbolized by seeing His face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, father of Absalom, who is dealing with the aftermath of Absalom's actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who had fled after killing his brother Amnon and is now returning to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who orchestrated Absalom's return to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where David's palace is located and where Absalom returns.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_absalom's_return.htm">The Event of Absalom's Return</a></b><br>After being in exile, Absalom is allowed to return to Jerusalem but is not permitted to see King David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_forgiveness.htm">The Complexity of Forgiveness</a></b><br>David's decision to allow Absalom to return but not see him reflects the struggle between justice and mercy.

It ultimately points to the need for a greater King who offers full pardon and unbroken fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Let him not see my face.</span>--David allowed Absalom's return, but forbade him his presence. The former had been done in weakness, the latter through a sense of justice. The effect of this half measure was unfortunate; Absalom was irritated, and yet placed in a favourable position to carry out his plots. It is probable that Absalom was confined to his own house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him turn to his own house,</span> etc. This half forgiveness was unwise, and led to unhappy results. It seems even as if Absalom was a prisoner in his house, as he could not leave it to visit Joab. Still, we must not assume that even kind treatment would have made Absalom a dutiful son, or weaned him from his ambitions purposes. The long plotted revenge, carried out so determinately, gives us a low idea of his character, and probably during these two years of waiting, he had brooded over David's criminal leniency, and regarded it as a justification for his own foul deed. And now, when allowed to come home, but still treated unkindly, thoughts condemnatory of his father's conduct were cherished by him. It seems, too, as if a protracted punishment is always dangerous to the moral character of the criminal. And must we not add another reason? Absalom, we may feel sure, saw with indignation the growing influence of Bathsheba over the king. A granddaughter of Ahithophel, she was sure to be an adept in those intrigues in which the women of a harem pass their time; and even if, upon the whole, we form a favourable judgment upon her character, yet undoubtedly she was a very able woman, and could have no affection for Absalom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
