Jerusalem, also known as the City of David, became the capital after David conquered it from the Jebusites (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). This city holds a central place in biblical history and prophecy, being the site of the future Temple and the focal point of messianic expectations.<p><b>Shammua,</b><br>Shammua is the first son listed, and his name means "heard" or "announced." While not much is known about Shammua himself, his inclusion in the list signifies the continuation of David's lineage. The name reflects a common biblical theme of God hearing and responding to His people, as seen in the naming of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>).<p><b>Shobab,</b><br>Shobab, whose name means "rebellious" or "backsliding," is another son of David. The name may reflect the tumultuous nature of David's family life, marked by internal strife and rebellion, as seen later in the actions of some of his children. This theme of rebellion is a recurring issue in the narrative of David's reign and the history of Israel.<p><b>Nathan,</b><br>Nathan, meaning "gift" or "given," is significant not only as David's son but also as a name shared with the prophet Nathan, who played a crucial role in David's life (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>). The prophet Nathan confronted David about his sin with Bathsheba and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne. Nathan's name here may symbolize God's grace and the prophetic voice in David's kingdom.<p><b>Solomon,</b><br>Solomon, whose name means "peaceful," is perhaps the most well-known of David's sons. He succeeded David as king and is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and the building of the Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 3-10). Solomon's reign is seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David of an enduring dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon is also a type of Christ, representing the ultimate King of Peace, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of the nation.

Scripture provides no exploits of Shobab, yet his inclusion matters (see <a href="/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple record of his birth underlines that God is filling David&#8217;s house with sons, multiplying the king&#8217;s heritage just as He multiplied Jacob&#8217;s sons to form the tribes of Israel (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Even unnamed deeds can serve God&#8217;s grand design; Shobab&#8217;s life contributed to the fullness of the royal family through whom the Messiah would eventually come (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nathan</b><p>&#8226; Third in the verse is &#8220;Nathan.&#8221; Though less famous than Solomon, Nathan&#8217;s significance stretches far into the New Testament: Luke traces Mary&#8217;s lineage through this very son (<a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a>), showing that Jesus is physically descended from David.<p>&#8226; By recording Nathan here, the Spirit prepares readers for a dual witness to Christ&#8217;s right to David&#8217;s throne&#8212;legal succession through Solomon (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6&#8211;16</a>) and bloodline through Nathan.<p>&#8226; Nathan&#8217;s appearance in both genealogies reveals God&#8217;s precision: He safeguards the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13&#8211;16</a>) while also bypassing later royal curses (<a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>) by routing the Messiah&#8217;s human ancestry through Nathan rather than through the later, disqualified kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon</b><p>&#8226; Finally, &#8220;Solomon&#8221; stands out as the heir God specifically chose to follow David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24&#8211;25</a>). His reign brings Israel to its historic zenith in peace, prosperity, and temple worship (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20&#8211;34</a>; 8:1&#8211;21).<p>&#8226; Solomon embodies the immediate fulfillment of God&#8217;s word that a son would build &#8220;a house for My name&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>), foreshadowing Christ who builds a greater, living temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of Solomon in this short list assures readers that God&#8217;s covenant plan is on course: from David to Solomon, and ultimately to &#8220;great David&#8217;s greater Son&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a> isn&#8217;t a throwaway line; it records the first four sons David fathered in Jerusalem, each birth testifying that God&#8217;s promise to establish David&#8217;s house is already unfolding. Shammua marks the fresh start in Zion, Shobab adds to the multiplying royal family, Nathan secures the Messianic bloodline, and Solomon anticipates the temple-building king&#8212;and, beyond him, the everlasting King, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">These be the names.</span>--The same list, with some variations, is given in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5-8</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/14-5.htm" title="And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,">1Chronicles 14:5-7</a>. According to <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>, the first four were children of Bathsheba (Bath-shua), and were consequently not born until a later period of David's reign. Solomon and Nathan are the two sons through whom St. Matthew and St. Luke trace our Lord's genealogy. Although Solomon is placed last in all the lists, he appears, from <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm" title="And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.">2Samuel 12:24</a>, to have been the oldest of Bathsheba's sons, and could otherwise hardly have been old enough to take charge of the kingdom at his father's death.

The first, <span class= "ital">Elishama, </span>in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-6.htm" title="Ibhar also, and Elishama, and Eliphelet,">1Chronicles 3:6</a>, is evidently a copyist's mistake for <span class= "ital">Elishua, </span>since Elishama occurs again in <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>; and the names of Eliphalet and Nogah, given in both lists in Chronicles, are omitted here, probably because they died young, the name of the former being given again to the last son in all the lists.
