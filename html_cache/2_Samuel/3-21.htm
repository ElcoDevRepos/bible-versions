This moment is pivotal as it represents a move towards unifying the kingdom under David. Abner's decision to speak to David highlights the political dynamics at play and the weakening of Saul's house.<p><b>&#8220;Let me go at once, and I will gather all Israel</b><br>Abner's proposal to gather all Israel signifies his influence and authority. It reflects the tribal nature of Israel at the time, where unity was often fragile. Abner's willingness to bring the tribes together under David's rule is a strategic move to consolidate power and ensure stability.<p><b>to my lord the king</b><br>By referring to David as "my lord the king," Abner acknowledges David's rightful claim to the throne. This acknowledgment is crucial as it comes from a former supporter of Saul, indicating a broader acceptance of David's kingship. It also fulfills the divine promise made to David regarding his future as king.<p><b>that they may make a covenant with you</b><br>Covenants were solemn agreements often sealed with religious rituals. Abner's intention to facilitate a covenant underscores the seriousness of the political alliance and the commitment to David's leadership. This echoes the biblical theme of covenants as foundational to Israel's relationship with God and its leaders.<p><b>and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase suggests the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>, where David is anointed as king. It also reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in establishing leaders according to His will. David's rule is portrayed as divinely ordained and aligned with God's purposes.<p><b>So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace.</b><br>David's dismissal of Abner in peace indicates a moment of reconciliation and trust. It contrasts with the violence and betrayal often seen in the narrative of Saul's house.

Abner unwittingly echoes divine intent: David is to shepherd, not exploit (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p>&#8226; Complete kingship over Israel foreshadows the Messiah&#8217;s perfect rule (Lu 1:32-33).<p>&#8226; The phrase testifies to God granting the desires of the righteous when those desires match His will (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s dismissal in peace displays trust in God&#8217;s sovereignty and confidence that Abner&#8217;s pledge will stand (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Peace&#8221; (shalom) previews the national reconciliation that will soon follow (<a href="/2_samuel/3-23.htm">2 Samuel 3:23, 5</a>:1).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s restraint contrasts with Joab&#8217;s later vengeance (<a href="/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-30</a>), illustrating the difference between godly patience and carnal retaliation (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-21.htm">2 Samuel 3:21</a> records a pivotal moment when Abner, former enemy, pledges to unite every tribe under David. Each phrase moves God&#8217;s plan forward: urgent obedience, national gathering, covenant commitment, complete rule, and peaceful dismissal. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to place His chosen king on the throne, model righteous leadership, and point ultimately to the everlasting reign of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
