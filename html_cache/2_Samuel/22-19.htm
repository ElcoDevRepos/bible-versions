The "day of calamity" can be understood as a period of severe trial or danger, possibly referring to the numerous battles and personal betrayals David experienced, such as Saul's pursuit or Absalom's rebellion. Biblically, calamity often signifies divine testing or judgment, as seen in Job's trials. The confrontation suggests an aggressive opposition, reminiscent of the spiritual battles believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<p><b>but the LORD was my support</b><br>Here, David acknowledges God's sustaining power and presence during his trials. The term "support" implies a foundation or a source of strength, akin to the imagery of God as a rock or fortress found throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). This reliance on God is a recurring theme in David's life, illustrating a deep trust in divine providence. Theologically, this reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God promises to be their protector and deliverer. This support is also a type of Christ, who is the ultimate source of strength and salvation for believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul declares he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of deliverance, David is reflecting on God's faithfulness during times of adversity.
