The act of taking a stand in the middle of the field signifies courage and determination. In the context of ancient warfare, holding one's ground was crucial, especially in open fields where retreat was easy. This act can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual steadfastness, reminiscent of <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, which calls believers to stand firm in the face of spiritual battles.<p><b>defended it</b><br>The defense of the field against the Philistines represents a commitment to protect what God has entrusted. This mirrors the responsibility of believers to guard their faith and the truths of Scripture. The field could symbolize the inheritance of Israel, which the Philistines frequently threatened. This act of defense is akin to the spiritual warfare described in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>, where believers are called to defend their faith against spiritual adversaries.<p><b>and struck down the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. Shammah's victory over them is a testament to God's power working through His chosen individuals. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of Israel's struggle against the Philistines, seen throughout the books of Samuel. It also prefigures the ultimate victory over spiritual enemies through Christ, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities.<p><b>So the LORD brought about a great victory</b><br>The acknowledgment that the LORD brought about the victory emphasizes divine intervention and sovereignty. It underscores the biblical theme that true victory comes from God, not human strength alone. This mirrors the sentiment in <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, where David declares that the battle belongs to the LORD. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ, who secures eternal triumph over sin and death, as celebrated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shammah.htm">Shammah</a></b><br>One of David's mighty warriors, known for his bravery and faithfulness.

The conflict is unavoidable; retreat would abandon the very heart of the harvest. Compare <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where believers are told to &#8220;stand your ground,&#8221; and <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230; the LORD your God is with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that faithfulness often surfaces in ordinary places&#8212;a lentil field, a kitchen, an office.
