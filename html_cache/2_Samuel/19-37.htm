Barzillai was an elderly man who had provided for David during his time of need. His request to return home shows his desire for peace and rest in his old age. The term "servant" indicates his submission and loyalty to the king, a common cultural expression of respect in ancient Israel.<p><b>that I may die in my own city</b><br>Barzillai's wish to die in his own city highlights the importance of one's homeland in ancient Near Eastern culture. It was customary for individuals to desire to be buried in their ancestral land, which was seen as a way to maintain familial and tribal connections even in death. This reflects the deep connection to land and heritage that was prevalent in Israelite society.<p><b>near the tomb of my father and mother</b><br>The mention of his parents' tomb underscores the significance of family lineage and ancestral burial sites in Israelite culture. Tombs were often located in family plots, and being buried near one's ancestors was a way to honor them and maintain family unity. This also reflects the biblical theme of honoring one's father and mother, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p><b>But here is your servant Chimham</b><br>Barzillai offers Chimham, likely his son or a close relative, to serve King David. This act of offering a younger family member to the king demonstrates Barzillai's continued loyalty and support for David's reign. It also shows the practice of entrusting the next generation to serve and support the king, ensuring ongoing allegiance and service.<p><b>Let him cross over with my lord the king</b><br>The phrase "cross over" refers to crossing the Jordan River, which was a significant geographical and symbolic boundary in Israel. Crossing the Jordan often represented entering into a new phase or chapter, as seen when the Israelites entered the Promised Land (Joshua 3-4). Barzillai's request for Chimham to accompany David signifies a transition and the continuation of support for the king's journey and reign.<p><b>and do for him what is good in your sight.</b><br>Barzillai entrusts Chimham to David's care, expressing confidence in the king's wisdom and benevolence. This reflects the biblical principle of trusting in the righteous judgment of a godly leader. It also echoes the theme of seeking favor and blessing from those in authority, as seen in other biblical narratives where individuals seek the king's favor (e.g., <a href="/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barzillai_the_gileadite.htm">Barzillai the Gileadite</a></b><br>An elderly and wealthy man who supported King David during Absalom's rebellion.

His request shows respect for the king while exercising personal choice, much like Caleb&#8217;s petition for Hebron in <a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>.<p>&#8226; The theme of gracious permission echoes David&#8217;s earlier words to Ittai the Gittite in <a href="/2_samuel/15-19.htm">2 Samuel 15:19&#8211;20</a>, highlighting the king&#8217;s openness to voluntary service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother</b><p>&#8226;

Scripture consistently affirms honoring parents and family roots (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>); Barzillai embodies that command, seeking a peaceful end close to loved ones.<p>&#8226; His earthly perspective underscores the brevity of life&#8212;paralleling <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>&#8212;and his desire for a dignified closure in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But here is your servant Chimham</b><p>&#8226; Rather than simply declining David&#8217;s invitation, Barzillai offers a substitute, showing selflessness and foresight.<p>&#8226; Chimham, likely Barzillai&#8217;s son, symbolizes the next generation stepping into service (compare <a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Barzillai models mentorship: he passes opportunity forward, mirroring Moses&#8217; investment in Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let him cross over with my lord the king</b><p>&#8226;

Barzillai trusts David to integrate Chimham, reflecting confidence in righteous leadership (<a href="/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The handoff illustrates how God weaves individual choices into His larger redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do for him what is good in your sight</b><p>&#8226;

(<a href="/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase underscores biblical teaching that favor and promotion ultimately come from God through appointed authority (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Barzillai&#8217;s words in <a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a> reveal humility, honor for family, generational vision, and trust in godly leadership. He declines royal luxury to finish life at home, while elevating Chimham to serve David. The passage affirms personal responsibility, respect for authority, and the Lord&#8217;s faithful orchestration of His people across generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Chimham.</span>--It appears from <a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm" title="But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.">1Kings 2:7</a>, where David gives charge to Solomon to care for Barzillai's sons, that Chimham was his son. This might be supposed from the narrative here, but is not expressly stated. In <a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a> mention is made of "the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem," from which it is supposed that David conveyed to Chimham a house upon his own paternal estate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may die in mine own city...by the grave of my father and of my mother.</span> The inserted words, "and be buried," are very matter of fact and commonplace. What Barzillai wished was that, when death overtook him, it should find him in the old abode of his family, where his father and mother had died, and where their tombs were. This regard for the family sepulchre was hereditary among the Israelites, who followed in it the example of their forefather (see <a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Chimham</span>. David remembered Barzillai's kindness to the last, and. on his dying bed specially commended Chimham and his brothers to the care of Solomon. In <a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a> we read of "the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem," whence it has been supposed that David also endowed the sen of Barzillai with land near his own city. Stanley ('Jewish Church,' 2:201) considers that this was a caravanserai founded by Chimham for the hospitable lodging of travellers on their way to Egypt, and that Mary and Joseph found shelter there. It lay to the south of Bethlehem; but there is nothing more than the name to connect it with the son of Barzillai. In ver. 40 he is called in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Chimhan.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let your servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
