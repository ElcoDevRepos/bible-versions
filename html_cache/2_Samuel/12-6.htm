The "thing" is David's adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, Uriah. This context is crucial as it highlights the gravity of David's actions, which were not only personal sins but also violations of God's commandments. The narrative underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for accountability, even for a king. This reflects the biblical principle that no one is above God's law.<p><b>and has shown no pity,</b><br>David's lack of compassion is emphasized here. In the parable Nathan tells, the rich man shows no pity to the poor man by taking his only lamb. This mirrors David's actions towards Uriah. The absence of pity is a significant moral failing, highlighting the importance of mercy and justice in biblical teaching. This connects to other scriptures that emphasize God's desire for mercy over sacrifice (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>).<p><b>he must pay for the lamb four times over.&#8221;</b><br>The requirement to pay fourfold is rooted in the Mosaic Law, specifically <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>, which states that a thief must repay four sheep for a stolen sheep. This legal principle underscores the concept of restitution and justice. In David's case, the fourfold repayment is prophetic, as he later suffers the loss of four of his sons: the child born to Bathsheba, Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the fulfillment of divine justice. Theologically, it also points to the need for atonement and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who pays the debt of sin for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah.
