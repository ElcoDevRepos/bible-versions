It was a place David passed through during his flight from Absalom. This context highlights David's vulnerability and the tension of his escape. The geographical setting underscores the proximity to Jerusalem, emphasizing the immediacy of the threat from Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out</b><br>This phrase indicates the ongoing tension between the house of Saul and the house of David. Saul was the first king of Israel, and his family had lost the throne to David. The mention of Saul's family suggests lingering resentment and political rivalry. This historical context reflects the deep-seated divisions within Israel, which were exacerbated by David's current predicament.<p><b>His name was Shimei son of Gera</b><br>Shimei is identified by name, which personalizes the encounter and highlights his role in the narrative. Being a member of Saul's family, Shimei's actions can be seen as motivated by loyalty to Saul's legacy. The mention of his father, Gera, situates Shimei within the broader genealogical context of the tribe of Benjamin, Saul's tribe, further emphasizing the tribal and familial loyalties at play.<p><b>and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses</b><br>Shimei's cursing of David is significant both culturally and theologically. In ancient Israel, cursing was a serious act, often invoking divine judgment. Shimei's actions reflect the cultural practice of expressing enmity and seeking justice through verbal imprecation. Theologically, this moment can be seen as a test of David's character and faith, as he chooses to endure the curses rather than retaliate, demonstrating humility and trust in God's sovereignty. This restraint can be seen as a type of Christ, who also endured reviling without retaliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is fleeing from his son Absalom during a time of rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bahurim.htm">Bahurim</a></b><br>A village in the territory of Benjamin, near Jerusalem, where the event takes place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei_son_of_gera.htm">Shimei son of Gera</a></b><br>A member of Saul's family who harbors resentment against David and expresses it through cursing and throwing stones.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>The backdrop of this event, where David's son Absalom has declared himself king, forcing David to flee Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul's_family.htm">Saul&#8217;s Family</a></b><br>The previous royal family of Israel, from which Shimei descends, providing context for his animosity towards David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_persecution_with_grace.htm">Responding to Persecution with Grace</a></b><br>David's response to Shimei's curses is a model of restraint and grace.
