In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a blessing of peace was significant, often indicating goodwill and trust. David's words may also reflect his desire for reconciliation and harmony within his family, despite past tensions. The phrase "Go in peace" is reminiscent of other biblical instances where peace is invoked, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a>, where Eli blesses Hannah. It also foreshadows the irony of Absalom's betrayal, as peace is not what he intends.<p><b>So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.</b><br>Hebron holds historical and spiritual significance in Israel's history. It was a city of refuge and the place where David was first anointed king over Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). Absalom's choice of Hebron is strategic; it is not only his birthplace but also a city with strong tribal loyalties. By going to Hebron, Absalom seeks to leverage these loyalties to support his rebellion against David. This act of going to Hebron can be seen as a type of false messianic claim, contrasting with Jesus Christ, who also faced betrayal but remained the true King. The mention of Hebron connects to the broader narrative of David's reign and the fulfillment of God's promises, as Hebron was a key location in the establishment of David's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his personal and familial struggles.

Here it signals the launch of rebellion.<p>&#8226; Personal initiative apart from divine sanction leads to ruin, as seen in Korah (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a>) and Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went to Hebron.</b><p>&#8226; Hebron holds rich covenant history&#8212;Abraham&#8217;s altars (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>), Caleb&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13</a>), and David&#8217;s own anointing as king (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom chooses this spiritually significant city to cloak his conspiracy with legitimacy, much like false teachers who &#8220;secretly introduce destructive heresies&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The journey fulfills his stated vow pretext (<a href="/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7-8</a>) yet primarily advances his self-exaltation, paralleling Lucifer&#8217;s &#8220;I will ascend&#8221; posture (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s trusting blessing, &#8220;Go in peace,&#8221; exposes no negligence but rather a heart that assumes honesty. Absalom exploits that grace, rises with calculated speed, and heads to Hebron to leverage sacred history for personal gain. The verse captures the tragic collision of righteous goodwill and deceitful ambition, reminding readers to cherish trust yet remain discerning, for rebellion often disguises itself beneath the language of peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in peace,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
