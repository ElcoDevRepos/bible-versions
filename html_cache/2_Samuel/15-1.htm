It suggests a period of planning and preparation by Absalom. The timing is significant as it follows the reconciliation between David and Absalom, highlighting the latter's growing ambition and dissatisfaction with his position.<p><b>Absalom provided for himself</b><br>Absalom's actions are self-initiated, reflecting his independent and ambitious nature. This self-provision indicates a desire for power and recognition, setting the stage for his rebellion against King David. It contrasts with the biblical ideal of leaders being chosen and anointed by God, as seen in David's own anointing.<p><b>a chariot with horses</b><br>Chariots were symbols of power and prestige in ancient Near Eastern cultures. They were often used by kings and military leaders, suggesting Absalom's intent to present himself as a royal figure. This act can be seen as a direct challenge to David's authority, as Israelite kings were traditionally not reliant on chariots, emphasizing trust in God over military might (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).<p><b>and fifty men to run ahead of him</b><br>The presence of fifty men running before Absalom serves as a public display of his status and influence. This entourage would have been a visual representation of his power and ambition, reminiscent of royal processions. It also reflects Absalom's strategic approach to gaining popular support, as he seeks to impress and win the favor of the people, foreshadowing his eventual attempt to usurp the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

Believers are reminded to examine their motives and ambitions in light of God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_humility.htm">The Importance of Humility</a></b><br>Absalom's self-promotion contrasts with the biblical call to humility. Scripture teaches that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Christians are encouraged to seek humility in their pursuits.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Absalom's rebellion is a consequence of unresolved family issues and past sins within David's household.

The verse introduces a heart posture of pride that will soon blossom into full rebellion.
