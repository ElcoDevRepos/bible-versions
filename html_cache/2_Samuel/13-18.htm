The act of throwing her out signifies the complete rejection and disgrace Tamar faced after being violated. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such an act would have been seen as a severe dishonor, not only to Tamar but also to her family. The bolting of the door symbolizes the finality and harshness of Amnon's rejection, leaving Tamar with no recourse or protection. This action reflects the broader theme of sin leading to further sin and the breakdown of familial relationships, a recurring theme in the narrative of David's family. The attendant's role in this act also underscores the complicity and normalization of wrongdoing within the royal household.<p><b>Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors,</b><br>The robe of many colors is significant as it denotes Tamar's status as a virgin daughter of the king. This type of garment was a symbol of purity and royal privilege, setting her apart in society. The mention of the robe draws a parallel to Joseph's coat of many colors in <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>, which also signified favor and distinction but led to jealousy and betrayal. The robe's description emphasizes the tragedy of Tamar's situation, as her outward appearance of honor and purity starkly contrasts with the violation she suffered. This garment, once a symbol of her dignity, becomes a poignant reminder of her lost innocence and the injustice she endured.<p><b>because this is what the king&#8217;s virgin daughters wore.</b><br>This phrase provides cultural and historical context, indicating that the king's virgin daughters had a specific dress code that signified their status and role within the royal family. It underscores the societal expectations and protections afforded to them, which were tragically violated in Tamar's case. The mention of the king's daughters wearing such robes also highlights the broader implications of Amnon's sin, as it was not just a personal transgression but an affront to the royal family and the societal order. This detail serves to heighten the sense of injustice and the failure of the king, David, to protect his children, foreshadowing the further turmoil and consequences that would arise within his household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The eldest son of King David, who committed a grievous sin against his half-sister Tamar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The daughter of King David, known for her beauty and innocence, who suffered greatly at the hands of her half-brother Amnon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father to both Amnon and Tamar, whose family faced turmoil and tragedy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>An unnamed servant of Amnon who followed orders to expel Tamar from the house.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_robe_of_many_colors.htm">The Robe of Many Colors</a></b><br>A garment symbolizing Tamar's status as a virgin daughter of the king, highlighting her purity and the gravity of the violation against her.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, especially within families, can have devastating and far-reaching consequences.

The door that once represented hospitality now becomes a barrier of shame, much like the closed doors of <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7-8</a> that only the Lord can open or shut.<p>&#8211; By locking Tamar out, Amnon tries to seal off consequences, but <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a> reminds us, &#8220;He who conceals his sins will not prosper.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The bolted door also prevents Tamar from reclaiming honor or confronting the crime immediately, deepening the injustice (compare <a href="/judges/19-25.htm">Judges 19:25-27</a> where a door marks separation between assault and help).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors</b><p>&#8211; This distinctive garment testifies to her royal identity and purity. It parallels Joseph&#8217;s robe in <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3-4</a>, a sign of favor that provoked sinful jealousy.<p>&#8211; The violent tearing away of this symbol (v. 19) shows how sin desecrates what God means for beauty and dignity (<a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Her robe publicly validated her status; its loss would publicly mark her shame, illustrating <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>&#8217;s promise that God alone can exchange &#8220;a garment of praise for a spirit of despair.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because this is what the king&#8217;s virgin daughters wore</b><p>&#8211; Scripture stresses her virginity to highlight the magnitude of Amnon&#8217;s violation&#8212;he has not merely hurt a woman; he has shamed the king&#8217;s household (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a>).<p>&#8211; The uniform of the princesses also shows David provided visible protection and honor for his unmarried daughters. Amnon&#8217;s act therefore rebels against both God&#8217;s law and the king&#8217;s order (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a> on respecting authority).<p>&#8211; Her status foreshadows Christ&#8217;s own identification with the dishonored; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> calls Him &#8220;despised and rejected,&#8221; yet He restores the broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 18 paints a tragic reversal: royal honor becomes public disgrace, familial care turns to cruelty, and a locked door tries to silence truth. Tamar&#8217;s ornate robe and forced expulsion expose how sin shatters God-given dignity, yet the passage invites trust that the Lord sees, judges, and ultimately clothes His children with lasting righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">A garment of divers colours.</span>--The word is used only here and in connection with Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm" title="Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.">Genesis 37:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joseph was come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;">Genesis 37:23</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-32.htm" title="And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be your son's coat or no.">Genesis 37:32</a>), and is supposed to mean a tunic with long sleeves, in distinction from those with short sleeves commonly worn. The fact is mentioned to show that Tamar must have been recognised as a royal virgin by Amnon's servant, as well as by everyone else.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A garment of divers colours</span>. This was probably a long tunic with sleeves, so woven as for the colours to form patterns like those of the Scottish tartans (see on Genesis 37:3). The next sentence is probably a note, which has crept from the margin into the text, and which literally is, "For so king's daughters, while unmarried, wore over mantles" (<span class="accented">me'ils</span>; see note on 1 Samuel 2:19). Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version so render as if the coloured chetoneth and the me'il were the same; but the meaning of the note rather is to guard against the supposition that the princess, while wearing the close-fitting long tunic with sleeves, had dispensed with the comely mantle. It is, indeed, possible that, while busy in cooking, she had laid the me'il by, and now rushed away without it. But it was the tunic with its bright colours which made both Amnon's servitor and also the people aware that she was one of the king's daughters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Amnon&#8217;s attendant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124;
