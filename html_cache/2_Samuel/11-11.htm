His response to King David highlights his character and commitment to his duties as a soldier. This sets the stage for the moral contrast between Uriah and David in this narrative.<p><b>&#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents,</b><br>The mention of the ark signifies the presence of God among His people, emphasizing the sacredness of the military campaign. The ark's presence in the field underscores the seriousness of the conflict and the spiritual commitment of the nation. Israel and Judah, representing the united kingdom, are engaged in battle, living in temporary shelters, which reflects the transient and uncertain nature of warfare.<p><b>and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field.</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, is leading the troops in battle. The soldiers' exposure to the elements in the open field highlights their vulnerability and dedication. This phrase underscores the camaraderie and shared hardship among the troops, contrasting with the comfort of city life.<p><b>How can I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife?</b><br>Uriah's rhetorical question reveals his sense of duty and solidarity with his fellow soldiers. It reflects the cultural and ethical expectations of the time, where personal comfort was secondary to communal responsibility. This statement also foreshadows the moral dilemma and the unfolding of David's plan.<p><b>As surely as you live, and as your soul lives,</b><br>This oath formula emphasizes the seriousness and sincerity of Uriah's words. It invokes the life of the king and the essence of his being, adding weight to Uriah's commitment. Such oaths were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, reflecting deep respect and solemnity.<p><b>I will not do such a thing!&#8221;</b><br>Uriah's firm resolution not to indulge in personal pleasures while his comrades are at war highlights his integrity. This statement serves as a stark contrast to David's actions and sets up the narrative tension. Uriah's loyalty and righteousness are implicitly commended, while David's subsequent actions are cast in a negative light.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in King David's army, known for his integrity and dedication to his duties.

(Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-18.htm" title="And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.">1Samuel 14:18</a>.) The separate mention of Israel and Judah gives no indication of a late date for this book, since these two parts of the nation had already been separated, and even hostile to each other in the early years of David's reign. This noble answer of Uriah should have stung David to the quick, but his conscience was so deadened by his sin that the only effect was to lead him to yet baser means of concealment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents.</span> The presence of the ark with the army in the field is puzzling, and shows us how little we know of the religious practices of the Jews, as, but for this chance mention of it, we should have affirmed that it was never taken out of its place in Zion, and that in previous times the conduct of Eli's sons in carrying it out of the sanctuary to war was an irregular act. The Jews themselves feel the difficulty, and some of their rabbins affirm that this was not the ark of the covenant, but a chest containing the ephod whereby inquiries were made of Jehovah. Certainly in <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a> it is expressly called "the ark of the covenant;" and in <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> "the ark of God." The use in our version of the special word "ark" obliges us to think of the ark of the covenant, whereas really it is a general word, rendered "chest" in <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9, 10</a>. It is said, too, that the war with Ammon was not a holy war, nor was it of such importance as to call for David's presence at the head of his troops. But, on the other hand, if it was not the ark of God, why did Uriah lay so great stress upon its presence in the field? Moreover, we find the ark with Saul in his war with the Philistines (l <a href="/1_samuel/14-18.htm">1 Samuel 14:18</a>), where it is expressly called "the ark of God," and is used for the purpose of inquiring the will of Jehovah. On comparing <a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a> with <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>, we should have imagined that the ark abode uncared for at the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, did we not plainly find it in attendance upon Saul. We are thus compelled to conclude that David sent it, with its attendant priests, with Joab, that he might consult the Deity by its moans. In the Talmud ('Shek. Jerus.,' 9. 2) the idea of there being an inferior or second ark used for this purpose is condemned. David, in his remonstrance with Uriah, shows signs of displeasure, and the conduct of the latter suggests the idea that his suspicious had been aroused. The war was going on prosperously; he had been summoned home on an honourable pretext to give the king a report of it; and it is, to say the least, strange that he should have cared so little for a wife, to whom apparently he had not long been married, and for his domestic affairs, as not even to go to his house, which was close by. The tone, too, of Uriah's answer is excited, and his military ardour too warm. David had assumed that, as a matter of course, he would hasten to visit his wife, and Uriah's unexpected refusal upsets his devices, and leaves him with all his difficulties increased rather than done away with. Very probably, in the conversation in the guard room, Uriah had received hints that his wife was too high in the royal favour. For "tents" the Hebrew has "booths," and so the Revised Version; and for "fields" the singular, "field." The Israelites still lived mostly in tents, and in war were content with very slight and temporary shelter, and if there were any parks, or enclosures, they were called Naioth, while "the field" was the open unenclosed land, which formed the mass of the country. The separate mention of "Israel and Judah" is no indication of the book having been written after the disruption of the kingdom. Uriah had been in David's service when he was king only at Hebron, and had taken part in the long war between Judah and the house of Saul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Uriah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#363;&#183;r&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_223.htm">Strong's 223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Uriah -- 'flame of Yah', the name of a Hittite and of two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
