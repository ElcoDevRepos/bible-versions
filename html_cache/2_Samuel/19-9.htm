The tribes of Israel were often divided in their loyalties, as seen in earlier conflicts between the northern and southern tribes. This internal strife reflects the broader theme of disunity that plagued Israel throughout its history, as seen in the eventual split into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah (1 Kings 12). The arguing also underscores the political instability and the challenges of maintaining a united kingdom under a single monarch.<p><b>&#8220;The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies</b><br>This refers to King David's military successes, particularly against external threats like the Philistines. David's reputation as a warrior king was established early in his reign, beginning with his victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17). His ability to protect Israel from its enemies was a key reason for his initial popularity and legitimacy as king. This phrase also echoes the biblical theme of deliverance, where God often raises leaders to rescue His people, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and delivered us from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during the time of the judges and the early monarchy. David's victories over the Philistines were significant in establishing Israel's security and territorial integrity. The Philistines' defeat under David's leadership is a testament to his military prowess and God's favor upon him. This deliverance is reminiscent of earlier biblical narratives where God delivers His people from oppression, such as the Exodus from Egypt.<p><b>but now he has fled the land because of Absalom</b><br>This phrase refers to the crisis caused by Absalom's rebellion, which forced David to flee Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13-14</a>). Absalom's revolt was a significant challenge to David's rule, highlighting the internal threats to his kingdom. The rebellion can be seen as a consequence of David's earlier sins, particularly his actions involving Bathsheba and Uriah (2 Samuel 11), which led to familial strife and divine judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). David's flight from Absalom is a moment of humility and vulnerability, contrasting with his earlier triumphs and foreshadowing the suffering servant motif fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who had fled Jerusalem due to the rebellion led by his son Absalom.

Their arguing exposes divided hearts: gratitude and rightful loyalty pull one way, political fear pulls another. The verse ultimately invites readers to recognize God&#8217;s faithfulness in past deliverances and to respond with renewed allegiance to His chosen king, trusting that the same God who granted former victories can restore present fortunes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The king saved us.</span>--With the collapse of the rebellion the accompanying infatuation passed away, and the people began to remember how much they owed to David.
