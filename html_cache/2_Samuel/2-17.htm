The battle took place during a period of civil war in Israel, following the death of King Saul. David had been anointed king over Judah, while Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was made king over the rest of Israel by Abner, Saul's army commander. The intensity of the battle reflects the deep division and struggle for power within the nation. This conflict can be seen as part of God's unfolding plan to establish David as the rightful king over all Israel, fulfilling the prophecy given to him by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>).<p><b>and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated</b><br>Abner, a skilled military leader and cousin to Saul, was a significant figure in the northern kingdom's resistance against David. His defeat signifies a turning point in the struggle for the throne. The men of Israel, representing the tribes loyal to Saul's house, were unable to withstand the forces of David. This defeat can be seen as a divine intervention, as God was with David, granting him success in his endeavors (<a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>). The defeat of Abner's forces foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule.<p><b>by the servants of David</b><br>The "servants of David" refers to David's loyal followers and warriors, including his mighty men, who were known for their bravery and skill in battle. These men were not just soldiers but were deeply committed to David's leadership and God's anointing on him. Their victory over Abner's forces underscores the legitimacy of David's kingship and God's favor upon him. This phrase also points to the theme of servanthood and loyalty, which are central to David's reign and are echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate servant leader (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army and a key figure in the power struggle following Saul's death.
