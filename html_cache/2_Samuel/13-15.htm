In the context of ancient Israel, such intense emotions often led to destructive actions. The hatred Amnon feels is a result of his guilt and shame after committing a grievous sin against Tamar, his half-sister. This reflects the biblical principle that sin often leads to further negative emotions and actions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a> with Cain's anger leading to Abel's murder.<p><b>that his hatred was greater than the love he previously had.</b><br>Amnon's "love" for Tamar was not genuine love but rather lust, which is fleeting and self-centered. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that true love is patient and kind, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>. The contrast between Amnon's initial desire and subsequent hatred illustrates the destructive nature of sin and the falsehood of equating lust with love.<p><b>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; he said to her.</b><br>Amnon's command to Tamar is abrupt and dismissive, reflecting his complete lack of respect and compassion. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, such treatment of a woman, especially after violating her, was a grave injustice. This command highlights the societal norms of the time, where women often had little recourse or protection against such abuses, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28-29</a>, which outlines laws for protecting women in similar situations.<p><b>&#8220;Be gone!&#8221;</b><br>Amnon's dismissal of Tamar is not only cruel but also compounds the injustice he has done to her. In the historical context, Tamar's future prospects would have been severely damaged by this act, as her purity was highly valued in her society. This phrase emphasizes the theme of rejection and abandonment, which is a recurring motif in the Bible, seen in the rejection of Jesus by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). Tamar's plight foreshadows the suffering of the innocent and the need for justice and redemption, themes central to the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The firstborn son of King David, who is infatuated with his half-sister Tamar.

With coarse violence he orders her away; and when, humbled and heartbroken, she begs for milder treatment, he adds insult to the wrong, and bids his manservant push her out, am! belt the door after her.
