Known for his swiftness, Asahel was a key figure in David's military. His death at the hands of Abner, the commander of Saul's army, was a significant event that fueled ongoing conflict between the house of David and the house of Saul. This act of taking Asahel signifies the respect and honor given to him by his family and comrades.<p><b>and buried him in his father&#8217;s tomb in Bethlehem.</b><br>Bethlehem, the city of David, holds significant historical and theological importance. It is the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ. The act of burying Asahel in his father's tomb indicates the importance of family lineage and heritage in ancient Israelite culture. It also reflects the practice of family burials, which was common in the ancient Near East, emphasizing the connection to one's ancestors and land.<p><b>Then Joab and his men marched all night</b><br>Joab, another son of Zeruiah and Asahel's brother, was a prominent military leader under David. His decision to march all night demonstrates his determination and urgency, likely driven by a desire for retribution and to secure David's position. This relentless pursuit reflects the intense loyalty and commitment of David's followers, as well as the harsh realities of ancient warfare.<p><b>and reached Hebron at daybreak.</b><br>Hebron was a significant city in Judah and served as David's capital before he established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. It was a city of refuge and a place of patriarchal significance, being associated with Abraham. Reaching Hebron at daybreak symbolizes a new beginning and the hope of establishing David's rule over all Israel.

Similar family-first burials appear with Jacob carrying Rachel to Ephrath (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>) and the men of Jabesh-gilead recovering Saul&#8217;s body (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Respect for the dead: Mosaic law required prompt burial (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>).

Burying Asahel there quietly ties his service to the larger work God is unfolding through David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Reminder of consequences: Asahel&#8217;s death at Abner&#8217;s hand (<a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18-23</a>) foreshadows the blood feud that will later claim Abner&#8217;s life (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>). The grave in Bethlehem becomes a silent witness to the cost of rivalry within Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joab&#8217;s march to Hebron</b><p>&#8220;Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at daybreak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Urgency and resolve: Having honored Asahel, Joab immediately turns to protecting David. An all-night march recalls earlier forced pursuits (<a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>) and highlights disciplined commitment.<p>&#8226; Strategic return: Hebron is David&#8217;s current seat of government (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>). By sunrise Joab places every warrior back under the king&#8217;s direct oversight, preventing Abner from exploiting their absence.<p>&#8226; Hebron&#8217;s covenant past: Caleb received Hebron as an inheritance (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13</a>). David&#8217;s reign from Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>) builds on that legacy, and Joab&#8217;s march reinforces God&#8217;s promise that leadership will remain there until the appointed time.<p>&#8226; Dependence on God&#8217;s keeping: While the troops labor through the darkness, &#8220;He who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>). The narrative quietly underscores that their safety ultimately rests in God&#8217;s vigilant care, not merely in Joab&#8217;s stamina.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/2-32.htm">2 Samuel 2:32</a> captures both tenderness and tenacity. Joab&#8217;s family honors Asahel with a dignified burial in Bethlehem, linking the fallen warrior to David&#8217;s covenant roots. Without delay the same men push through the night to Hebron, safeguarding David&#8217;s fledgling kingdom. The verse therefore illustrates loyalty to family, loyalty to God-appointed leadership, and confidence that the Lord&#8217;s purposes advance even amid grief and conflict.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">They took up Asahel.</span>--The bodies of the ordinary soldiers were probably buried on the spot, but on account of Asahel's position and near relationship to David, his body was carried to Bethlehem, for burial "in the sepulchre of his father." It thus appears that Zeruiah's husband (of whom there is no other mention) was also of Bethlehem. The burial must have taken place on the next day (see Note on <a href="/2_samuel/2-30.htm" title="And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.">2Samuel 2:30</a>), and, with the previous march of ten miles, would have filled up that day. It was, therefore, twenty-four hours after the close of the battle before they were ready to start from Bethlehem. The night may have been chosen for the march to avoid the heat; and the distance from Bethlehem to Hebron was about thirteen miles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem.</span> The Name of Zeruiah's husband is never mentioned, but he was evidently of the same town as his wife, and at his death, when probably still young, he had received honourable sepulture. As Bethlehem is about eleven miles distant from Gideon, Joab probably marched thither straight from the battlefield, and spent the next day in paying the last tribute of respect to his brother, and in refreshing his men. At nightfall he resumed his march to Hebron, which was fifteen miles further to the south, and where he would arrive on the morning following that on which Abner reached Mahanaim. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Later, they took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#347;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
