Gilgal holds historical importance as the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River under Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was a place of renewal and covenant, symbolizing a return to God's promises. David's crossing to Gilgal signifies a restoration of his kingship and a return to divine favor. Theologically, it echoes themes of redemption and restoration found throughout Scripture, such as the Israelites' return from exile.<p><b>and Chimham crossed over with him</b><br>Chimham is believed to be the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who had shown loyalty and support to David during his time of need (<a href="/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31-40</a>). By crossing with David, Chimham represents the faithfulness and reward of those who support God's anointed. This act of loyalty is reminiscent of the blessings promised to those who align themselves with God's purposes, as seen in the stories of Ruth and Rahab. Chimham's inclusion in this journey may also foreshadow the hospitality and provision that David would later extend to him, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>.<p><b>All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king</b><br>This phrase highlights the political and tribal tensions within the nation of Israel. The division between Judah and Israel is a recurring theme, eventually leading to the split of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. The support of Judah, David's own tribe, underscores their loyalty, while the partial support from Israel indicates lingering divisions. This situation reflects the broader biblical narrative of unity and division among God's people, paralleling the New Testament call for unity in the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>). The escorting of the king by these troops symbolizes the restoration of order and the re-establishment of David's rule, prefiguring the ultimate reign of Christ as the unifying King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is returning to his kingdom after the rebellion of his son Absalom.

Crossing &#8220;to Gilgal&#8221; signals an intentional public return to covenant life; Gilgal was Israel&#8217;s first campsite after the original Jordan crossing under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; By choosing Gilgal, David retraces Israel&#8217;s salvation history, reminding the nation that God still reigns and that His anointed king is back in place (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores restoration, not mere political maneuvering. God&#8217;s promise to establish David&#8217;s throne remains intact (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>), and David knowingly acts in line with that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Chimham crossed over with him</b><p>&#8226; Chimham is the son (or possibly close relative) of Barzillai, the elderly Gileadite who had sustained David during exile (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27&#8211;29</a>; 19:31&#8211;38). Barzillai declined royal favor for himself, asking that Chimham receive it instead.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s acceptance of Chimham shows covenant kindness (hesed) rewarded with tangible blessing (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>). Later, David tells Solomon to &#8220;show kindness to the sons of Barzillai&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>), and Jeremiah mentions an inn near Bethlehem linked to Chimham&#8217;s name (<a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), suggesting that David granted him land or stewardship there.<p>&#8226; The episode models how loyalty to God&#8217;s anointed leads to secure, generational blessing (<a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34&#8211;40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king</b><p>&#8226; Judah, David&#8217;s own tribe, rallies fully around him (<a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11&#8211;14</a>).

Even in victory, earthly unity is fragile; wholehearted allegiance to God alone sustains true oneness (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet David allows both groups to join the procession, portraying a king eager to heal rifts (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). His patience anticipates Christ, who welcomes all who come yet grieves over partial, hesitant commitments (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/19-40.htm">2 Samuel 19:40</a> pictures a restored king re-entering the land at a covenant-laden site, honoring a faithful household through Chimham, and receiving both full and partial escorts from a nation still mending. The verse celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to His promises, commends loyalty to His anointed, and gently warns that divided hearts jeopardize unity. Those who cross over with the King share in His favor; those who lag behind miss the fullness of His blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">All the people.</span>--The tribe of Judah, deeply moved by the measures and words of David, had united generally in his restoration; the other tribes, who had first proposed to return to their allegiance (<a href="/context/2_samuel/19-9.htm" title="And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.">2Samuel 19:9-10</a>), had not had time to join in the present movement, or had not generally known of it, and only Shimei with his one thousand Benjamites, and doubtless others living near, together with the tribes east of the Jordan, represented altogether as "half the people of Israel," were able to come together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Half the people of Israel.</span> The northern tribes had been the first to debate the question of the king's recall (ver. 9), while the men of Judah hung back. But at the instigation of the high priests and of Amasa, who was actually in command, they determined upon David's restoration, and acted so promptly and so independently of the rest of Israel that, when they reached Gilgal, only the delegates of a few tribes were in time to join them. As we read in ver. 41 of "all the men of Israel," it is evident that the rest had rapidly followed. It would have been well if the tribe of Judah had informed the rest of their purpose, as the bringing of David back would then have been the act of all Israel; but tribal jealousies were the cause of Israel's weakness throughout the time of the judges, and broke out into open disunion upon the death of Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
