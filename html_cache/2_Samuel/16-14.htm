The journey from Jerusalem to the Jordan River is arduous, reflecting the physical and emotional toll on David and his followers. The exhaustion signifies not only the physical strain but also the weight of betrayal and uncertainty. This moment echoes the trials faced by God's people throughout scripture, such as the Israelites wandering in the desert. It also prefigures the suffering of Christ, who bore the burdens of humanity.<p><b>And there he refreshed himself.</b><br>The location where David refreshes himself is significant. It is likely near the Jordan River, a place of transition and renewal in biblical history. This act of refreshing can be seen as a moment of divine provision and grace, reminiscent of Elijah being sustained by God in the wilderness. It also foreshadows the rest and renewal found in Christ, who offers spiritual refreshment to the weary. This moment underscores the theme of God's faithfulness and provision even in times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.
