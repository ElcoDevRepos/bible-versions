Absalom, David's son, had gained significant support from the Israelites, indicating a deep political and social rift. This rebellion is a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God declared that the sword would never depart from David's house due to his sin with Bathsheba. The support for Absalom reflects the discontent among the people, possibly due to David's previous failures as a king and father.<p><b>camped in the land of Gilead.</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was a strategic location for Absalom's forces, providing a natural defense and a base for operations against David. Historically, Gilead was part of the territory given to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The choice of Gilead as a campsite may also symbolize a return to the roots of Israel's tribal confederation, as these tribes were among the first to settle in the Promised Land. The geographical setting underscores the seriousness of the conflict, as Absalom's forces were positioned to challenge David's authority directly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.

The verse opens by naming &#8220;the Israelites,&#8221; reminding us that this is not a random crowd but God&#8217;s covenant people, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence signals a national crisis; the whole kingdom is caught up in Absalom&#8217;s rebellion, contrasting sharply with earlier times when &#8220;all Israel&#8221; rallied behind David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments of collective movement appear in <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, where &#8220;all the Israelites came out&#8230; as one man,&#8221; showing how corporate action often marks critical turning points in Israel&#8217;s history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Absalom</b><p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s name separated from &#8220;the Israelites&#8221; highlights the tragic division: the son rebels against his father, King David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture underscores Absalom&#8217;s personal ambition in <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>, where he steals hearts to make himself king.<p>&#8226; His leadership contrasts with God&#8217;s anointed; compare David&#8217;s God-appointed rise (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) with Absalom&#8217;s self-appointed ascent, echoing warnings like <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>camped in the land</b><p>&#8226;

The encampment becomes a pause&#8212;an opportunity for God&#8217;s providence to unfold. While Absalom arrays his forces, God is already orchestrating deliverance through David&#8217;s allies (<a href="/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Gilead</b><p>&#8226; Gilead lies east of the Jordan, historically a refuge (<a href="/genesis/31-21.htm">Genesis 31:21</a>) and a borderland administered by tribes like Gad, Reuben, and half-Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/13-24.htm">Joshua 13:24&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; David also finds support in this region; friends such as Shobi, Machir, and Barzillai bring supplies &#8220;while the people were in Mahanaim in the wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; Gilead&#8217;s rugged terrain offers strategic defense, recalling earlier conflicts where leaders gathered there for protection (<a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/17-26.htm">2 Samuel 17:26</a> records more than a campsite location; it captures a moment when God&#8217;s covenant people, led astray by Absalom, position themselves for battle in Gilead. The phrase-by-phrase reading highlights:<p>&#8226; A divided nation (&#8220;the Israelites &#8230; and Absalom&#8221;).<p>&#8226; A militarized pause (&#8220;camped in the land&#8221;).<p>&#8226; A storied setting of refuge and decision (&#8220;of Gilead&#8221;).<p>Through it all, Scripture shows God quietly working to preserve His chosen king and fulfill His promises, reminding us that even in seasons of upheaval, the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand firm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Pitched in the land of Gilead.</span>--Gilead is the tract of country on the east of the Jordan, extending from the land of Moab on the south to Bashan on the north, the valley of the Hieromax forming probably its northern boundary.
