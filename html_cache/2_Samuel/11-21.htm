This historical context highlights the ignoble end of a leader who sought power through violence and treachery, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of pride and ambition.<p><b>Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall,</b><br>The mention of a woman using an upper millstone, a heavy stone used for grinding grain, emphasizes the unexpected and humbling nature of Abimelech's death. In ancient warfare, walls were strategic defensive structures, and the use of a millstone from the wall signifies the resourcefulness of the defenders. This incident underscores the theme of divine justice, where God uses unlikely means to bring about the downfall of the wicked.<p><b>so that he died in Thebez?</b><br>Thebez was a city in ancient Israel, and its mention here serves to remind the reader of the specific historical setting of Abimelech's demise. Thebez's successful defense against Abimelech's siege contrasts with the failure of his violent ambitions, illustrating the futility of opposing God's will.<p><b>Why did you get so close to the wall?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the tactical error of approaching too closely to a fortified wall during a siege, a mistake that cost Abimelech his life. In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>, it serves as a parallel to David's own strategic and moral failures, as he orchestrates Uriah's death. The question implies a lack of wisdom and foresight, drawing a connection between physical and spiritual battles.<p><b>If he asks you this, then you are to say,</b><br>This instruction is part of a message crafted by David to Joab, his military commander. It reflects David's attempt to control the narrative and manage the consequences of his actions. The directive underscores the theme of manipulation and deceit, as David seeks to cover up his sin with Bathsheba by orchestrating Uriah's death.<p><b>&#8216;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Uriah's death marks the culmination of David's plan to conceal his adultery with Bathsheba. Uriah, a Hittite and a loyal soldier, represents the innocent victim of David's sin. This phrase highlights the tragic cost of David's moral failure and sets the stage for the subsequent judgment and repentance narrative. Uriah's inclusion as a Hittite also emphasizes the diversity within David's army and the broader theme of God's covenant extending beyond ethnic Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Jerubbesheth (Gideon), who was killed by a woman dropping a millstone on him in Thebez, as recounted in <a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>.

The reminder is meant to stir David&#8217;s memory of how quickly a siege can turn deadly when warriors get too close to fortified walls.<p>&#8226; By invoking Abimelech, Joab affirms that such events are part of Israel&#8217;s recorded history, underscoring the literal truthfulness of Scripture (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical point: commanders bear responsibility for troop safety; ignoring past lessons leads to needless loss (<a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez?</b><p>&#8226; Joab underlines the irony: Abimelech fell to an unexpected, seemingly weak source&#8212;a woman wielding a household tool (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>).<p>&#8226; For David, the detail heightens the warning: siege warfare invites unpredictable dangers (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it shows how God can humble the proud through the least likely means (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison presses David to see that Joab&#8217;s men faced the same risk when they advanced under the walls of Rabbah (<a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why did you get so close to the wall?</b><p>&#8226; Joab anticipates David&#8217;s likely rebuke. Any seasoned king would ask why troops approached a wall after history had taught otherwise (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes the tactical flaw. It also reveals Joab&#8217;s calculated plan: he expects criticism but wants to deflect it quickly (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment mirrors how sin often draws us &#8220;close to the wall,&#8221; ignoring clear warnings until consequences strike (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If he asks you this, then you are to say,</b><p>&#8226; Joab coaches the messenger, crafting the narrative so the final line overshadows the battle report.<p>&#8226; The messenger&#8217;s obedience highlights military hierarchy, but also shows complicity in a deceptive scheme (<a href="/2_samuel/11-19.htm">2 Samuel 11:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; This instruction illustrates how people can manipulate facts to manage appearances (<a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12-13</a>; <a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.</b><p>&#8226; The punch line satisfies David&#8217;s secret agenda (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14-17</a>).

By recalling Abimelech&#8217;s folly, Joab anticipates the king&#8217;s criticism for letting troops get too near Rabbah&#8217;s wall. Yet the real intent is to cloak David&#8217;s engineered death of Uriah. The verse reveals how historical lessons can be twisted to justify present sin, how leadership responsibility can be sidestepped, and how concealed wrongdoing spreads corruption through every level of authority. Above all, it stands as a sober warning: God&#8217;s Word faithfully records both the failures and their consequences, urging us to heed His truth and walk uprightly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Who smote Abimelech?</span>--See <a href="/judges/9-53.htm" title="And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone on Abimelech's head, and all to broke his skull.">Judges 9:53</a>. Joab anticipated David's anger at his apparent rashness, and charged the messenger, when he should observe it, to mention's Uriah's death. This was not likely to awaken any suspicion in the messenger, as it would appear to him rather as an effort on Joab's part to throw the blame from himself upon Uriah as the leader of the assaulting party. The messenger appears to have told all in one breath, so that there was no opportunity for David to express displeasure. The reference to the case of Abimelech shows how familiar the Israelites were with the past history of their people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerubbesheth</span>; in <a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a> called <span class="accented">Jerubbaal</span>, that is, Gideon. (On the substitution of Besheth, or more correctly Bosheth, for Baal, see notes on 2 Samuel 2:8; 9:6.) It is remarkable that the LXX., Vulgate, and Syriac all read here Jerubbaal, though, like the Hebrew, they have Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth. Probably the change, which was not made until after the days of Jezebel, was only gradually carried out by the scribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who [was the one]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to strike</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Abimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_40.htm">Strong's 40: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abimelech -- 'father is king', a Philistine name, also an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jerubbesheth?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;rub&#183;be&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3380.htm">Strong's 3380: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerubbesheth -- 'shame will contend', a name of Gideon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Was it not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a woman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who dropped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#353;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7993.htm">Strong's 7993: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw out, down, away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an upper millstone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(pe&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6400.htm">Strong's 6400: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cleavage, a millstone</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
