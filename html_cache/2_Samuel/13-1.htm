The narrative transition suggests a period of relative peace or normalcy in David's household before the unfolding of new familial tensions. This time lapse can also imply a period of unresolved issues or simmering tensions within the royal family, setting the stage for the events that follow.<p><b>David&#8217;s son Amnon</b><br>Amnon is the firstborn son of King David, making him the heir apparent to the throne of Israel. His position as the eldest son gives him significant status and expectations within the royal family. However, his actions in this chapter reveal a lack of moral integrity and self-control, which ultimately lead to his downfall. Amnon's character and choices serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked desires and the consequences of sin.<p><b>fell in love with Tamar</b><br>The phrase "fell in love" is somewhat misleading in this context, as Amnon's feelings for Tamar are more accurately described as lust rather than genuine love. This distinction is crucial, as it highlights the selfish and destructive nature of Amnon's desires. Tamar, whose name means "palm tree," is a symbol of beauty and purity, and her tragic story underscores the vulnerability of women in ancient patriarchal societies. The misuse of the term "love" here serves as a reminder of the importance of distinguishing between true love, which is selfless and sacrificial, and lust, which is self-serving and harmful.<p><b>the beautiful sister of David&#8217;s son Absalom</b><br>Tamar is noted for her beauty, which is a recurring theme in biblical narratives and often serves as a catalyst for conflict. Her relationship to Absalom, another of David's sons, is significant, as it sets the stage for the familial strife that follows. Absalom's protective nature and eventual vengeance for Tamar's mistreatment highlight the deep bonds of sibling loyalty and the devastating impact of Amnon's actions on the entire family. This familial connection also foreshadows Absalom's later rebellion against David, as the seeds of discord are sown in this chapter.<p><b>Absalom</b><br>Absalom is a key figure in the narrative of 2 Samuel, known for his striking appearance and charismatic leadership. His name means "father of peace," which is ironic given the turmoil he brings to David's kingdom. Absalom's response to Tamar's plight reveals his sense of justice and familial duty, but also his capacity for vengeance and ambition. His actions in the aftermath of Tamar's violation set off a chain of events that lead to his eventual rebellion and tragic end. Absalom's story serves as a complex exploration of the themes of justice, revenge, and the consequences of sin within a family and a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father of Absalom, Amnon, and Tamar.

Months&#8212;perhaps even a couple of years&#8212;have passed since Nathan&#8217;s rebuke (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) and the death of David&#8217;s infant son (<a href="/2_samuel/12-18.htm">2 Samuel 12:18&#8211;23</a>). Life in the palace appears outwardly settled, yet God&#8217;s word through Nathan still stands: &#8220;the sword shall never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>). This opening phrase reminds us that divine consequences often ripen gradually. The time gap lulls David&#8217;s family&#8212;and us&#8212;into thinking all is well, only to reveal, as <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> warns, that whatever a man sows, he will indeed reap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David&#8217;s son Amnon</b><p>Amnon, named first among David&#8217;s children (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>), holds the privileged position of crown prince.

She is Absalom&#8217;s full sister, sharing both father and mother (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>). That family link matters on two levels:<p>&#8226; Moral boundary: <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a> forbids sexual relations with a half-sister.

The verse warns that sinful desire, left untended, grows within homes and hearts, yet God&#8217;s word remains steadfast: His justice and mercy operate even in the hidden corridors of a royal palace&#8212;and our own lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">It came to pass after this.</span>--This formula applies to the narrative which follows as a whole: not, of course, to the fact immediately afterwards mentioned, that Absalom's sister was Tamar. This may illustrate the use of the same phrase in other places.<p>Absalom and Tamar were children of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur, and the former, at least, had been born during David's reign at Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>). It is probable that the events here narrated occurred soon after the war with the Ammonites and David's marriage with Bath-sheba.<p><span class= "bld">Amnon</span> was David's first-born son (3:2).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this.</span> This phrase, as we have seen on 2 Samuel 10:1, has little chronological force, but the date of the sad event which formed the second stage in David's punishment can be settled with considerable certainty. Tamar was the daughter of Maacah, a princess of Geshur, and David's marriage with her, while still at Hebron, is mentioned as a proof of his growing power, and consequently some time must have elapsed after his appointment as king before this alliance took place. As Absalom was apparently older than Tamar, if she were now fifteen or sixteen years of age. David would have been king of all Israel at least thirteen or fourteen years, and would have reached the summit of his glory. His wars would be over, Rabbah captured, and his empire firmly established. For twenty more years he must sit upon his throne, but as a culprit, and bear the many sorrows resulting from his sin. Amnon was David's firstborn, the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel; and probably he would never have committed his shameless crime had not David's own sin loosed the bonds of parental authority. As it was, he hesitated, but was encouraged to it by his cousin, who was too subtle a man not to weigh David's character well before coming to the conclusion that Amnon might safely gratify his lusts. The name Tamar means "palm tree," and both she and Absalom were remarkable for their personal beauty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After some time,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
