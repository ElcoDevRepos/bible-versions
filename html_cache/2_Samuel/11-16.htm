This military action was part of a larger campaign against the Ammonites, who had previously humiliated David's envoys (<a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-5</a>). The siege was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. Joab's role as a military leader is significant throughout David's reign, often executing David's orders with precision, though sometimes with questionable ethics (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>).<p><b>he assigned Uriah</b><br>Uriah the Hittite was one of David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>), indicating his valor and loyalty. Despite being a Hittite, Uriah was fully integrated into Israelite society and faith, as evidenced by his name, which means "Yahweh is my light." His assignment by Joab was not random but a deliberate act orchestrated by David to cover up his sin with Bathsheba, Uriah's wife (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2-5</a>).<p><b>to a place where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers were</b><br>Joab placed Uriah in a perilous position on the battlefield, ensuring his death. This was a strategic decision to fulfill David's command to have Uriah killed (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14-15</a>). The strongest enemy soldiers would have been the most skilled and experienced warriors, making Uriah's survival unlikely. This act of betrayal highlights the moral decline in David's leadership, contrasting with his earlier righteousness. The narrative foreshadows the consequences of sin, as David's actions lead to personal and national turmoil (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, tasked with carrying out David's orders regarding Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, whom David sought to eliminate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who orchestrated the plan to have Uriah killed to cover up his sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the city being besieged by Joab and the Israelite army, likely Rabbah of the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>David's attempt to cover up his sin with Bathsheba led to further sin, demonstrating how sin can compound and lead to devastating consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_integrity.htm">The Importance of Integrity</a></b><br>Uriah's integrity and loyalty stand in stark contrast to David's actions, reminding us of the importance of maintaining integrity even when others do not.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While David faced severe consequences for his actions, God's mercy was also evident in his life.

The &#8220;city&#8221; is Rabbah of Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), a real stronghold east of the Jordan.<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s siege is literal warfare, continuing the campaign David himself should have led (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>).<p>&#8226; While the army endures hardship outside the walls, David lingers in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1-2</a>), setting the stage for the chain of sin that follows.<p>&#8226; Scripture presents the scene without embellishment, anchoring the narrative in historical reality&#8212;just as it later records Joab&#8217;s eventual capture of the city (<a href="/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The siege reminds us that battlefield choices often reveal spiritual conditions (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3-4</a> for the Lord&#8217;s intended mindset of Israel&#8217;s warriors).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he assigned Uriah to a place</b><p>&#8226; Joab acts on the sealed orders David sent with Uriah himself (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14-15</a>)&#8212;a tragic twist showing how far David&#8217;s deception has progressed.<p>&#8226; By &#8220;assigning&#8221; Uriah, Joab becomes a willing instrument of David&#8217;s plan, illustrating how sin spreads to others when unconfessed (cf. <a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>: &#8220;If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Uriah, unaware and loyal, submits to his commander&#8212;a stark contrast to the betrayal plotted against him (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>, where Uriah is later honored among David&#8217;s mighty men).<p>&#8226; The narrative demonstrates that even high military strategy can be hijacked for personal sin, highlighting the need for godly integrity in leadership (<a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>; <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers were</b><p>&#8226; The placement is intentional, not tactical&#8212;Joab chooses the fiercest battle point to guarantee Uriah&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_samuel/11-17.htm">2 Samuel 11:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors the earlier account Joab anticipates David referencing about Abimelech dying under a wall (<a href="/2_samuel/11-20.htm">2 Samuel 11:20-21</a>; <a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53-54</a>), showing Joab&#8217;s cold calculation.<p>&#8226; The phrase exposes the premeditated nature of the plot, moving David&#8217;s sin from private lust to public bloodshed (cf. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>: &#8220;sin&#8230; when full-grown gives birth to death&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Uriah&#8217;s faithfulness magnifies the injustice&#8212;he refuses to enjoy the comforts of home while the ark and Israel&#8217;s army dwell in tents (<a href="/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>), yet he is sacrificed for David&#8217;s comfort.<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the verse spotlights humankind&#8217;s capacity for manipulation, setting up Nathan&#8217;s prophetic confrontation (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>) and God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a> records Joab deliberately placing Uriah at the most dangerous point of the siege so that he would be killed, fulfilling David&#8217;s sinful scheme. The verse is a sober, factual statement of a planned murder under the guise of military strategy. It exposes the cascading effect of unrepented sin&#8212;from desire to deception to death&#8212;while underscoring the reliability of Scripture in recounting both the triumphs and the failures of God&#8217;s people. The account prepares the ground for God&#8217;s merciful yet just response, reminding us that only His grace in Christ can cleanse hearts twisted by such wrongdoing (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23-26</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Observed the city.</span>--The word means <span class= "ital">watched, or blockaded. </span>In the operations of the siege Joab so arranged some of his forces as to invite a sally from the city under circumstances in which it would be successful. It appears from <a href="/2_samuel/11-24.htm" title="And the shooters shot from off the wall on your servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2Samuel 11:24</a> that Uriah's party had been sent so near as to come within reach of the archers on the wall.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Joab observed the city;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">kept watch upon the city.</span> This does net mean, as some suppose, that Joab sent a body of men to examine the fortifications with a view to an assault, and so provoked a sally. The verb simply refers to the ordinary operations of a siege, which usually resolved itself into a long blockade, continued until starvation compelled a surrender; and to hasten this the people of the villages were forced into the town, by the rule that all left outside were put to the sword. To maintain the blockade, men were posted at all fit points round the city, and these were constantly assailed by the besieged. Joab then placed Uriah at a post which was especially the object of attack; and when the usual sally took place and was repulsed, Joab seems to have ordered Uriah to pursue them up to the very gate, where they would be exposed to a shower of arrows from the walls. Others fell besides Uriah, and that the loss was considerable, and the result of bad generalship, though designedly such, seems probable from the deprecation of the king's anger in ver. 20. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
