This location is significant because it is where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept for many years after being returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). The journey signifies a pivotal moment in David's reign, as he seeks to centralize worship in Jerusalem. The gathering of "all his troops" underscores the importance of this mission, reflecting the communal and national significance of the Ark.<p><b>to bring up from there the ark of God</b><br>The Ark of God, or the Ark of the Covenant, is a sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It symbolizes God's presence and covenant with Israel. David's intention to bring the Ark to Jerusalem highlights his desire to establish the city not only as the political capital but also as the spiritual center of Israel. This act foreshadows the future establishment of the temple by Solomon, David's son.<p><b>which is called by the Name</b><br>The phrase "called by the Name" emphasizes the holiness and reverence associated with the Ark. In biblical terms, "the Name" often refers to God's revealed character and presence. This reflects the deep respect and awe that the Israelites held for the Ark, as it was directly associated with God's identity and His covenant with His people.<p><b>the name of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" (Yahweh Sabaoth) signifies God's supreme authority over the heavenly armies and all creation. It underscores His power and sovereignty, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. This title reassures the Israelites of God's protection and leadership, especially as they face various enemies and challenges.<p><b>who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on it</b><br>The cherubim on the Ark's cover, known as the mercy seat, represent the throne of God. This imagery of God being "enthroned between the cherubim" conveys His divine presence and kingship. It is a powerful symbol of God's dwelling among His people, and it prefigures the ultimate revelation of God's presence in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, signifying God's presence and blessing upon the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baale-judah.htm">Baale-judah</a></b><br>Also known as Kiriath-jearim, this is the location from which David intended to bring the Ark of God to Jerusalem.

It has been generally identified with <span class= "ital">Kuryet-el-enab, </span>about eight miles a little north of west from Jerusalem. More recent opinion places it at <span class= "ital">'Erma, </span>about eleven miles a little south of west from Jerusalem, and four miles east of Bethshemesh. In either case it was three or four hours' march from the capital.<p><span class= "bld">Whose name is called.</span>--Neither the text nor the margin of the English represents the original quite accurately. Translate, <span class= "ital">which is called by the name, the name of Jehovah of hosts. </span>The ark is thus described as being the visible symbol of God's presence and of His covenant with His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Baale of Judah.</span> We learn from <a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 60</a> that Baalah, or Kirjath-Baal, "the city of Baal," was the old Canaanite name of Kirjath-jearim, the "city of woods." It lay about eight miles westward from Jerusalem (see <a href="/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>). The preposition "from" is very startling, as really David went <span class="accented">to</span> Baale. Yet all the versions have it, but they put on Baale an incorrect meaning. Baal means "lord," "master," and they render, "David went with all the people that were with him <span class="accented">from</span> [or, <span class="accented">of</span>] the citizens of Judah," understanding by "master" a householder, one who was master of a family. The real explanation probably is that the narrator wrote according to the sense, and not according to the grammar. The thought in his mind was the bringing up of the ark from its long resting place, and not the prior physical necessity of going down to the place where it was. <span class="cmt_word">With all the people.</span> David had consulted with "the captains of thousands and hundreds, and every leader" (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>), and it was with their good will that he drew the ark of God out of its long concealment. A select body of these nobles, or sheiks, would accompany the king, while the rest, with their attendants, would be posted along the eight miles of road. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name is called by the name.</span> In the Hebrew, the word "name" is twice repeated, the words literally being, <span class="accented">the ark of Elohim, whereon is called the Name, the Name of Jehovah of Sabaoth.</span> Most of the versions omit the second <span class="accented">Name</span>, and the translators of the Authorized Version also felt it to be a difficulty, which they have tried to escape by inserting words between the two. Really it is a most interesting sign of the existence at this early date of a special reverence for the name "with four consonants" which we call "Jehovah." Subsequently it was never pronounced, but the word "Lord" was read instead, in the Revised Version, the importance of the passage is well brought out by the first Name being written with a capital, of the use of which the Revisers are very chary. With their usual inconsecutiveness, they retain Lord for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, though this is "the Name," and though they have restored the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in several less important places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
