Rechab and Baanah were captains in Ish-bosheth's army, and their actions were politically motivated, aiming to gain favor with David by killing Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. Beeroth was one of the Gibeonite cities, and its inhabitants were absorbed into the tribe of Benjamin. This background highlights the complex tribal and political dynamics in Israel during David's ascent to the throne. David's response reflects his commitment to justice and righteousness, rejecting any form of treachery or murder as a means to secure his kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives</b><br>This phrase is an oath, invoking the living God as a witness to the truth of David's words. It underscores David's deep faith and reliance on God, a recurring theme throughout his life. The invocation of the LORD's name in an oath was a serious matter, reflecting the speaker's sincerity and the gravity of the situation. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the living God, in contrast to the lifeless idols of the surrounding nations.<p><b>who has redeemed my life from all distress</b><br>David acknowledges God's providential care and deliverance throughout his life. This statement reflects David's personal history of being pursued by Saul, facing numerous battles, and enduring various trials. The concept of redemption here is both physical and spiritual, as God has preserved David's life and guided him to the throne. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and spiritual death. David's recognition of God's hand in his life serves as a testament to his faith and trust in God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God and his role in uniting the tribes of Israel.

His appeal to Jehovah, as One that had saved him in all time of adversity, was a declaration that he had no need of criminals. And throughout he had carefully abstained from taking any steps to bring about the accomplishment of God's will, and had been upright and forbearing alike to Ishbosheth and Saul. How noble his conduct was we see by the contrast with Macbeth, whose better nature was poisoned and spoiled by the hope that he should be king hereafter. At the end of the verse the force is weakened in the Authorized Version by the insertion of irrelevant words.
