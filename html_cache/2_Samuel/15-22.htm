This phrase highlights David's leadership and trust in God's sovereignty, even in adversity. Ittai the Gittite, a foreigner from Gath, shows loyalty to David, which is significant given the historical enmity between Israel and the Philistines. This loyalty reflects the theme of God's kingdom being open to all nations, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>).<p><b>So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men</b><br>Ittai's commitment to David is remarkable, as he had only recently joined David's service. His decision to march with David demonstrates the power of personal loyalty and faithfulness, qualities that are highly valued in biblical narratives. The mention of "all his men" indicates that Ittai was a leader of a significant group, suggesting that he was a person of influence and authority. This mirrors the loyalty of the Gentile centurion to Jesus in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>, where faith transcends ethnic boundaries.<p><b>and all the little ones who were with him.</b><br>The inclusion of "the little ones" underscores the comprehensive nature of Ittai's loyalty, as he brings not only his warriors but also their families. This detail highlights the vulnerability and trust involved in following David during a time of uncertainty. It reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s care for families and the importance of community. The presence of families also emphasizes the human cost of political upheaval and the faith required to follow God's anointed leader, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey in the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.
