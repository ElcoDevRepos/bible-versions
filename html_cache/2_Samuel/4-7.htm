In ancient Near Eastern culture, entering someone's house, especially a royal residence, without permission was a significant violation. This act foreshadows the betrayal and treachery that follows.<p><b>while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed</b><br>Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, was in a vulnerable state, resting or possibly asleep. This detail highlights the cowardice of the attackers, as they chose a moment when he was defenseless. Beds in ancient Israel were simple, often just mats on the floor, indicating the intimate setting of this betrayal.<p><b>and having stabbed and killed him</b><br>The act of stabbing signifies a violent and personal attack. In the context of biblical narratives, such acts of violence often reflect the chaotic and brutal nature of the period of the Judges and early monarchy. This murder was not just a political assassination but also a violation of the sanctity of life, which is a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>they beheaded him</b><br>Beheading was a common practice in ancient warfare and was often used to demonstrate total victory over an enemy. This gruesome act was intended to send a message of power and dominance. In biblical terms, it echoes the fate of Goliath, whose head was also taken as a trophy by David, highlighting the brutal realities of ancient conflicts.<p><b>took his head</b><br>Taking the head of Ish-bosheth was a symbolic act meant to prove the deed and claim a reward. In the cultural context, presenting the head of a defeated enemy was a way to gain favor or assert authority. This act also reflects the political instability and the struggle for power following Saul's death.<p><b>and traveled all night by way of the Arabah</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region stretching from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Traveling by night suggests urgency and a desire to avoid detection, as well as the harsh conditions of the desert journey. This route indicates the geographical and strategic considerations of the time, as the Arabah was a known trade and travel route. The journey underscores the lengths to which individuals would go to secure political advantage in the turbulent period of Israel's early monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ish-bosheth.htm">Ish-bosheth</a></b><br>The son of Saul and a king of Israel, who reigned over the northern tribes after Saul's death.

The writer records the act plainly, underscoring both men&#8217;s deliberate choice and God&#8217;s sovereign observation of every deed (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). Their entry recalls other clandestine intrusions&#8212;Ehud into Eglon&#8217;s private chamber (<a href="/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>) and Joab into the gate to murder Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>). In each case, treachery rather than open battle marks the crime, contrasting with David&#8217;s refusal to kill Saul even when the opportunity seemed easy (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed</b><p>The king&#8217;s afternoon rest (<a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>) exposes a tragic vulnerability. Scripture often portrays sleep as a gift of God (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), yet here it becomes the setting for betrayal. Ish-bosheth&#8217;s position &#8220;on his bed&#8221; echoes Saul in the camp (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7</a>) and King Elah in Tirzah (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9</a>)&#8212;leaders caught unaware because others around them lacked loyalty or godliness. The scene reminds us that earthly security is fragile apart from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and having stabbed and killed him</b><p>The blunt description&#8212;&#8220;stabbed and killed&#8221;&#8212;leaves no doubt: this is murder in cold blood, violating God&#8217;s enduring command, &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). Earlier Abner had fallen to Joab&#8217;s blade outside Hebron&#8217;s gate (<a href="/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>); now Ish-bosheth dies similarly, fulfilling Samuel&#8217;s warning that Israel&#8217;s desired monarchy would bring sorrow (<a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11&#8211;18</a>). <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> declares that shedding innocent blood demands accountability, a principle David will soon apply to the assassins (<a href="/2_samuel/4-11.htm">2 Samuel 4:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they beheaded him</b><p>Cutting off the head shifted the crime from assassination to calculated display. David had once removed Goliath&#8217;s head (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>) as proof of God&#8217;s victory; in contrast, Recab and Baanah seek personal reward. The Bible often links beheading to humiliation and public warning&#8212;Saul&#8217;s head fastened in Philistine temples (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>) or John the Baptist&#8217;s head presented on a platter (<a href="/mark/6-27.htm">Mark 6:27&#8211;28</a>). Here it sets the stage for an appeal to David they believe will secure favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>took his head</b><p>Carrying the head turns the king&#8217;s corpse into evidence of their deed. Like the Amalekite who brought Saul&#8217;s crown to David hoping for honor (<a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), these brothers misjudge David&#8217;s heart. They overlook his consistent respect for God&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14&#8211;16</a>), revealing their own spiritual blindness. Scripture repeatedly contrasts worldly calculation with godly integrity (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; 11:18).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and traveled all night by way of the Arabah</b><p>The Arabah&#8212;Jordan&#8217;s rift valley&#8212;offered a swift, secluded southern route to Hebron (<a href="/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1</a>). Traveling &#8220;all night&#8221; underscores urgency and fear, paralleling Ahimaaz&#8217;s rapid run to bring news to David (<a href="/2_samuel/18-23.htm">2 Samuel 18:23</a>). Darkness may conceal from men, yet <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11&#8211;12</a> reminds us it hides nothing from God. Every step southward brought them closer to divine justice, not the reward they imagined.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a> records a calculated act of treachery: stealthy entry, a defenseless king, a fatal stabbing, desecration through beheading, trophy-taking, and a frantic nighttime flight. Each phrase exposes human schemes and violence while quietly affirming God&#8217;s oversight and coming judgment. The verse warns against seeking advancement through sin, highlights the sanctity of life and of God-ordained authority, and prepares us for David&#8217;s righteous response that vindicates divine justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Took his head.</span>--There is no difficulty with the repetition in <a href="/2_samuel/4-7.htm" title="For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.">2Samuel 4:7</a> of what has been already mentioned inverse 6, for it is common in the Scripture narratives to repeat statements when any additional fact (as here, the carrying off of the head) is to be mentioned.
