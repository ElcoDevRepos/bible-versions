His role as overseer of forced labor indicates the organization and centralization of the kingdom's workforce, which was essential for large-scale projects such as building infrastructure and fortifications. This position highlights the administrative sophistication of David's reign. Forced labor, while common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often involved the conscription of Israelites and foreign captives. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the later oppressive labor under Solomon, which contributed to the division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). The role of Adoram underscores the tension between the benefits of a strong centralized government and the burdens it placed on the people.<p><b>Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;</b><br>Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, served as the recorder or chronicler, a position of significant importance in the royal court. The recorder was responsible for maintaining official records, documenting events, and possibly advising the king. This role ensured that the king's decrees, military campaigns, and other significant events were accurately recorded for posterity. The presence of a recorder reflects the bureaucratic development during David's reign, emphasizing the importance of historical documentation in governance. Jehoshaphat's position is mentioned multiple times in the context of both David's and Solomon's administrations (<a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>), indicating continuity and stability in the kingdom's leadership. This role can be seen as a type of Christ in the sense that it points to the ultimate record-keeper, God, who keeps a perfect account of human history and individual lives (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoniram.htm">Adoniram</a></b><br>He was appointed by King David to oversee the forced labor, a significant administrative role in the kingdom.

David organized it to strengthen the nation and secure its borders after civil unrest (cf. <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; 5:13-16).<p>&#8226; Adoram (also called Adoniram, <a href="/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>) continues in this post under Solomon, proving the continuity of David&#8217;s administration. His long tenure shows the stability God granted Israel when the king ruled in obedience.<p>&#8226; While the term &#8220;forced labor&#8221; may sound harsh, Israel&#8217;s law contained humane boundaries (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-11</a>; 24:14-15). The chronicler notes that foreigners, not fellow Israelites, bore the heaviest burden under Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The text therefore highlights David&#8217;s practical wisdom: consolidating national unity through organized service, yet within limits set by God&#8217;s covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder</b><p>&#8226; The second clause adds, &#8220;Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>).<p>&#8226; A recorder was more than a scribe; he functioned as royal historian, archivist, and adviser&#8212;keeping official records, drafting decrees, and chronicling God&#8217;s works among the people (see <a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-15.htm">1 Chronicles 18:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s role ensured accuracy and transparency in the kingdom. The recorder preserved the covenant story for future generations, echoing God&#8217;s command to &#8220;write this as a memorial&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His ongoing service from earlier in David&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>) demonstrates faithful continuity. Amid political turmoil (the rebellion of Sheba in <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/20.htm">2 Samuel 20</a>), the recorder kept the historical account intact, safeguarding truth for the people of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a> literally lists two key officials to show that, even after internal rebellion, David&#8217;s kingdom remained orderly. Adoram managed the labor force to advance national projects within covenant boundaries, while Jehoshaphat faithfully documented the king&#8217;s acts for posterity. The verse underscores God-given structure, accountability, and continuity&#8212;reminding us that divine order under righteous leadership secures both progress and historical faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Adoram was over the tribute.</span>--The same office was held by <span class= "ital">Adoniram </span>in Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm" title="And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.">1Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm" title="And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.">1Kings 5:14</a>), and by <span class= "ital">Adoram </span>at the beginning of the reign of his successor (<a href="/1_kings/12-18.htm" title="Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.

"The tribute" should rather be <span class= "ital">the levy, </span>the forced labour so largely employed by Solomon. It is remarkable that there is no trace of such an office in <a href="/context/2_samuel/8-16.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;">2Samuel 8:16-18</a>, nor in the parallel (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/18-14.htm" title="So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.">1Chronicles 18:14-17</a>). It was a feature of Oriental despotism only introduced towards the close of David's reign, and carried to much greater length under Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Adoram was over the tribute.</span> This was a new officer, and a new thing. For the Hebrew word <span class="accented">mas</span> does not mean "tribute," but "forced labour." This was one of the most oppressive exactions of old time, and it continued to be practised in Europe throughout the Middle Ages until it was abolished at the end of the eighteenth century by the French Revolution, except in Russia, where the serfs were freed from it by the late emperor Alexander II. Nevertheless, it was probably made almost necessary at first by the absence of money. As there was no money for the payment of taxes, the dues of the king or lord could only be rendered by personal service. Yet even so it was exceedingly liable to be abused, and the people might be taken from their own homes and fields just when their presence there was most needed. One most painful result was that the women had to endure, upon the farm and among the cattle, a drudgery to which they were unsuited. We gather from this passage that it was David who began this practice in Israel, exacting probably only from the descendants of the Canaanites (who, nevertheless, formed a considerable portion of the inhabitants of Palestine) forced labour employed in preparing for the building of the temple, and in the fortifications of his fenced cities. Under Solomon it seems to have been extended to other classes (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13, 14</a>; but see <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-22</a>), and reduced to a system, which pressed so heavily upon the people that it was the principal cause of the revolt of the ten tribes from Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Unless the Israelites had themselves suffered severely from this exaction, they would not have been driven into rebellion by sympathy with the remains of the native races. Subsequently we find Jeremiah accusing Jehoiakim of employing forced labour (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), but the severity with which he condemned it suggests that it had then ceased to be customary. <span class="accented">Adoram.</span> His appointment to this office was probably at a late period in David's reign, as he continued to hold the office under Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>, where he is called <span class="accented">Adoniram</span>), and even down to the beginning of Rehoboam's reign (<a href="/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>).
