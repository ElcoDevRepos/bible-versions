His name means "iron-hearted," reflecting his strong character. Gilead was known for its balm, a valuable commodity, indicating the region's prosperity. Barzillai's support for David during Absalom's rebellion highlights his loyalty and courage, as siding with David was risky. His actions exemplify the biblical principle of supporting God's anointed leader, paralleling the loyalty expected of believers to Christ.<p><b>had come down from Rogelim</b><br>Rogelim is a town in Gilead, though its exact location is uncertain today. The phrase "come down" suggests a descent from a higher elevation, typical of the hilly terrain of Gilead. This journey signifies Barzillai's commitment, as traveling in ancient times was arduous and potentially dangerous. His willingness to leave his home underscores his dedication to David, reflecting the biblical theme of leaving one's comfort zone to serve God's purposes.<p><b>to cross the Jordan with the king</b><br>Crossing the Jordan River is symbolic in biblical narratives, often representing a transition or new beginning. For David, crossing back over the Jordan signifies the restoration of his kingship after Absalom's rebellion. Barzillai's presence with David during this crossing highlights his role as a supporter and friend. This act can be seen as a type of the believer's journey with Christ, crossing from the old life into the new life of faith.<p><b>and send him on his way from there</b><br>Barzillai's intention to send David on his way indicates his desire to ensure the king's safe passage and successful return to Jerusalem. This reflects the cultural practice of providing hospitality and protection to travelers, especially those of high status. Barzillai's actions demonstrate the biblical value of generosity and support for God's chosen leaders. His willingness to aid David can be seen as a foreshadowing of the support believers are called to offer to Christ and His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barzillai_the_gileadite.htm">Barzillai the Gileadite</a></b><br>A wealthy and elderly man from Gilead who supported King David during Absalom's rebellion.

These references frame Barzillai as a steadfast ally rather than a passing acquaintance.<p>&#8226; The verse begins with &#8220;Now,&#8221; signaling continuity: David is returning from exile, and the same friend who stepped in during crisis steps up again. <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.&#8221; Barzillai lives that proverb.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had come down from Rogelim</b><p>&#8226; Rogelim was a Transjordan settlement in Gilead, so &#8220;come down&#8221; implies Barzillai left the comfort of his home territory to meet David at the river. This is deliberate, not accidental.<p>&#8226; Leaving home carried personal cost; at around eighty (<a href="/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32</a>), travel was no small effort. His action echoes the call found in <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The geographical note roots the story in real space and time, underscoring the historical reliability of the narrative rather than presenting it as myth or parable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to cross the Jordan with the king</b><p>&#8226; The Jordan River often marks a turning point: Israel entering the promised land (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3&#8211;4</a>), Elijah&#8217;s final miracle before his fiery departure (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>), and here, David&#8217;s restoration.<p>&#8226; By crossing with David, Barzillai publicly identifies with the true, anointed king. In contrast, Shimei once cursed David along the same riverbank (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>); now, Barzillai honors him, recalling Jesus&#8217; teaching, &#8220;Whoever acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge before My Father in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).<p>&#8226; This act is not mere sentiment. It carries political risk; pockets of Absalom&#8217;s sympathizers still exist (<a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>). Standing with David at the Jordan models <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and send him on his way from there</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures Barzillai escorting David across and then providing for the journey onward. 3 <a href="/bsb/john/6.htm">John 6</a> commends such hospitality: &#8220;You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Barzillai&#8217;s generosity is practical: food, supplies, companionship, and likely protection. It illustrates <a href="/james/2-16.htm">James 2:16</a>, warning against saying &#8220;Go in peace; keep warm and well fed&#8221; without tangible help.<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s welfare, not personal recognition, is Barzillai&#8217;s focus. He will shortly decline David&#8217;s generous offer to live at court (<a href="/2_samuel/19-34.htm">2 Samuel 19:34-37</a>), choosing quiet service over royal privilege.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Barzillai&#8217;s appearance in <a href="/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31</a> captures a living picture of covenant faithfulness. An elderly, wealthy Gileadite leaves Rogelim, meets David at the Jordan, publicly crosses with him, and personally equips the restored king for the road ahead. Every phrase of the verse spotlights concrete love that acts, risks, and gives&#8212;echoing the wider biblical call for believers to stand with God&#8217;s chosen, to sacrifice comfort, and to serve without thought of reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Barzillai</span>.
