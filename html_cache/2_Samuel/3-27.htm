It was also a city of refuge, where individuals accused of manslaughter could seek asylum. Abner's return to Hebron signifies his attempt to negotiate peace and consolidate the kingdom under David, following his defection from Ish-bosheth, Saul's son.<p><b>Joab pulled him aside into the gateway</b><br>The gateway of a city was a place of legal transactions and important discussions. Joab's action of pulling Abner aside suggests a pretense of a private conversation, which was a common tactic in ancient times to lower one's guard. Joab, David's military commander, had personal motives against Abner, as Abner had killed Joab's brother Asahel in battle.<p><b>as if to speak to him privately</b><br>This phrase indicates deception. Joab's intention was not to have a private conversation but to exact revenge. The act of speaking privately was a ruse to isolate Abner from any potential protectors, highlighting Joab's cunning and the personal vendetta he harbored.<p><b>and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach</b><br>Stabbing in the stomach was a brutal and personal method of killing, often associated with vengeance. This act of violence was not only a personal vendetta but also a violation of the sanctuary that Hebron, as a city of refuge, was supposed to provide. Joab's actions were against the spirit of justice and mercy that the cities of refuge represented.<p><b>So Abner died on account of the blood of Joab&#8217;s brother Asahel</b><br>This phrase underscores the theme of blood vengeance, which was a prevalent cultural practice in ancient Israel. The death of Asahel at the hands of Abner during a previous battle set the stage for this act of retribution. However, Abner had killed Asahel in self-defense during wartime, which complicates the moral and legal justification for Joab's actions. This incident reflects the cycle of violence and the challenges of leadership and justice in David's rise to power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who had initially opposed David but later sought to make peace and support David's kingship over all Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army and a nephew of David.

Abner trusted David&#8217;s promise; Joab exploited that trust for private revenge, proving that personal grudges breed treachery and bring God&#8217;s righteous judgment on the perpetrator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Aside in the gate.</span>--The gateway was a customary place of conference in the East, and Joab there awaited Abner's return; he then took him "aside" to some place of privacy, as the LXX. reads, "by the side of the gate." On the phrase "fifth rib," see Note on <a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm" title="However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.">2Samuel 2:23</a>. The reason for this cold-blooded and treacherous murder on the part of Joab is expressly said to be "for the blood of Asahel his brother;" but no doubt his revenge was quickened by jealousy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab took him aside in the gate.</span> As we read in <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a> of David sitting "between the two gates," and of "the roof over the gate," and in ver. 33 of "the chamber over the gate," Ewald's idea of there being a roofed inner space, with a guard room over it, as in the mediaeval gate towers in German towns, is probably right. As the "two gates" would make the space between them gloomy, the spot would just suit Joab's purpose. He meets Abner, therefore, in a friendly manner, and drawing him aside, as if to converse with him apart from the people going in and out, there assassinates him. The place was so public that the deed must have been witnessed by multitudes, though the gloom, felt the more by them from the contrast with the bright glare of sunshine outside, had given Joab the opportunity of drawing his sword without Abner's observing it. <span class="cmt_word">For the blood of Asahel his brother.</span> Joab's act was in accordance with Oriental feeling; and the duties of the avenger of blood might with some straining be made to cover his retaliation for an act done by Abner in self-defence (<a href="/numbers/35-26.htm">Numbers 35:26, 27</a>). It is remarkable that Hebron was itself a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), and this may have led Joab to murder him in the gate, before he had actually entered. Still, Abner did not expect any such retribution, and supposing that Joab knew of the purpose that had brought him to Hebron, he could not suppose that he would be so indifferent to his master's interests as to put a summary stop to the negotiations for uniting the tribes under David. As it was, this deed brought upon David an evil name, and four or five years had to elapse before the tribes could be induced to take him for their king. Even then his hold over them was far less than it would otherwise have been; for though the shock was gradually got over, yet the suspicion still dung to him. And if the deed was Joab's own act, still David had contributed to it by underhand dealings. His very fear of Joab had caused him to wrong his able general, and given him just cause for resentment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
