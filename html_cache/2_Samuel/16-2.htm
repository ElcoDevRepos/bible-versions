The king's question to Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, reflects a moment of uncertainty and vulnerability. David's inquiry suggests a need for understanding Ziba's intentions, as he is in a precarious situation. This moment highlights David's reliance on others during his time of distress, a theme seen throughout his life, such as when he depended on Jonathan's loyalty (1 Samuel 20).<p><b>Ziba replied, &#8220;The donkeys are for the king&#8217;s household to ride,</b><br>Ziba's response indicates his intention to support David's escape by providing transportation. Donkeys were common beasts of burden in ancient Israel, used for travel and carrying loads. This provision would have been practical for David's household, emphasizing the urgency and necessity of their flight. The mention of donkeys also connects to other biblical narratives where donkeys play a role in significant journeys, such as Balaam's donkey (Numbers 22) and Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21:1-7</a>).<p><b>the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat,</b><br>The bread and summer fruit symbolize sustenance and provision. In the ancient Near East, bread was a staple food, and summer fruits like figs and raisins were common, providing necessary energy and nutrition. This provision reflects the cultural practice of hospitality and care for those in need. The young men, likely David's soldiers or attendants, would require nourishment for their journey, paralleling God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.&#8221;</b><br>Wine in biblical times was often used for refreshment and medicinal purposes. In the context of the wilderness, a harsh and unforgiving environment, wine would serve to rejuvenate and strengthen those who were weary. This provision can be seen as an act of kindness and foresight by Ziba, ensuring that David's followers remain capable and alert. The wilderness motif is significant in Scripture, representing both physical and spiritual trials, as seen in Israel's wanderings (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>) and Jesus' temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom during a time of political and familial turmoil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>The servant of Mephibosheth, who brings provisions to David and his men as they flee.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has initiated a rebellion against his father, causing David to flee Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where David and his followers find themselves, symbolizing a place of trial and testing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, whom David had previously shown kindness to by restoring his grandfather's land and allowing him to eat at the king's table.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_need.htm">God's Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>Just as Ziba provided for David and his men, God often uses unexpected means and people to provide for our needs during difficult times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_relationships.htm">Discernment in Relationships</a></b><br>David's interaction with Ziba reminds us of the importance of discernment.

Donkeys provided steady, reliable transport for royalty and commoners alike (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By offering mounts, Ziba appears to care for the king&#8217;s family, meeting a tangible need during a hasty escape.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s provision often arrives in humble packages&#8212;just as Christ chose a donkey colt for His triumphal entry (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>), highlighting meekness over military might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Bread is staple sustenance; summer fruit (figs, raisins) supplies quick energy and vitamins&#8212;military rations for weary troops (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a> shows Abigail providing similar fare to David&#8217;s men).<p>&#8226; Physical nourishment underscores the Lord&#8217;s concern for body as well as soul (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41-43</a>: Jesus feeds the five thousand).<p>&#8226; Later, Shobi, Machir, and Barzillai bring comparable supplies (<a href="/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28-29</a>), confirming that God faithfully layers provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Wine serves medicinal and restorative purposes (<a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>), especially in desert heat.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s company is literally &#8220;in the wilderness,&#8221; echoing earlier seasons when God sustained him there (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail anticipates a greater refreshment offered by the Messiah&#8212;&#8220;new wine&#8221; of the covenant (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in hardship, God supplies sources of strength that foreshadow eternal joy (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>: &#8220;wine that gladdens the heart of man&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/16-2.htm">2 Samuel 16:2</a> shows God&#8217;s timely, concrete care for His anointed king through Ziba&#8217;s gift, while also exposing mixed human motives. The donkeys, bread, fruit, and wine meet immediate needs, declare David&#8217;s enduring kingship, and prefigure Christ&#8217;s humble yet royal provision for His followers. The verse invites us to recognize providence in the ordinary, discern hearts behind apparent kindness, and trust that the Lord equips His people for every wilderness journey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do you have these?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
