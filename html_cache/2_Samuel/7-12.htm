It reflects the Hebrew understanding of death as a return to one's people, emphasizing continuity and legacy. The phrase "rest with your fathers" suggests a burial tradition and a belief in an afterlife or continued existence with one's forebears, a concept seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>I will raise up your descendant after you</b><br>This promise from God to David is a key element of the Davidic Covenant, ensuring the continuation of his lineage. The term "descendant" is often interpreted as Solomon, David's immediate successor, but it also prophetically points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of this promise. The idea of God "raising up" a descendant underscores divine intervention and purpose in the establishment of leadership.<p><b>who will come from your own body</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the biological lineage from David, ensuring that the promise is not metaphorical but literal. It highlights the importance of bloodline in the fulfillment of God's promises, a theme prevalent in the genealogies of the Bible. This direct lineage is crucial in establishing Jesus' rightful claim to the throne of David, as outlined in the genealogies of Matthew and Luke.<p><b>and I will establish his kingdom</b><br>The establishment of the kingdom refers initially to Solomon's reign, marked by peace and the building of the Temple. However, it also foreshadows the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is a central theme in Christian eschatology. The promise of an everlasting kingdom is a cornerstone of messianic prophecy, with Jesus' reign fulfilling the ultimate vision of a kingdom that will never end, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God, and a man after God's own heart.

Scripture presents death for the covenant people as rest, not extinction (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p>- Earlier, the Lord had told Moses, &#8220;You are going to rest with your fathers&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>). The same covenant faithfulness that carried Moses home will carry David&#8212;and every believer&#8212;into God&#8217;s keeping.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will raise up your descendant after you</b><p>- The verb &#8220;raise up&#8221; signals divine initiative.

The resurrection underlines the permanence of this &#8220;raising up.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will come from your own body</b><p>- The promise narrows: the heir is biologically David&#8217;s, not an adopted successor. This echoes God&#8217;s word to Abram: &#8220;A son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4</a>).<p>- Paul later affirms that Jesus &#8220;was a descendant of David according to the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>), tying the eternal King to David&#8217;s literal lineage.<p>- The detail guards against counterfeit claims; only someone in David&#8217;s line qualifies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will establish his kingdom</b><p>- For Solomon the establishment meant a secure throne as long as he walked in obedience (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-5</a>).<p>- For the greater Son, the rule is unending: &#8220;He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will never end&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<p>- Prophets reinforce the permanence: &#8220;Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end&#8230;on David&#8217;s throne&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). Revelation seals it: &#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p>- God Himself guarantees the throne, making it inviolable by human rebellion or time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God promises David that after his finite life and peaceful death, the Lord Himself will raise up a true, literal heir from David&#8217;s own line. First fulfilled in Solomon&#8217;s immediate reign, the promise reaches its climactic fulfillment in Jesus Christ, whose eternal kingdom God alone establishes and secures. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s redemptive plan marches on beyond individual lifespans, grounded in His faithfulness and culminating in the everlasting reign of David&#8217;s greater Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Which shall proceed.</span>--The promise here given certainly has immediate reference to Solomon, and it is thought by many that the use of the future shows that he was not yet born. This may be the fact, and if so, the expression will give an important indication of the point in David's reign to which this passage belongs.
