His mother, Abigail, was previously married to Nabal, a wealthy but harsh man from Carmel. Abigail's marriage to David followed Nabal's death, which is detailed in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>. This union is significant as it highlights David's growing influence and the consolidation of his power through strategic marriages. Abigail is noted for her wisdom and beauty, and her marriage to David brought legitimacy and alliances. Carmel, located in the Judean wilderness, was a fertile area, and its mention underscores the wealth and status associated with Abigail. Chileab's lack of mention in later narratives suggests he may have died young or was not involved in the political struggles of David's other sons.<p><b>his third was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;</b><br>Absalom is a prominent figure in the narrative of David's reign, known for his rebellion against his father. His mother, Maacah, was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur, a small Aramean kingdom northeast of the Sea of Galilee. This marriage was likely a political alliance, strengthening David's ties with neighboring regions. Absalom's story is marked by ambition and tragedy, as he later leads a revolt against David, which is detailed in <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15-18</a>. His actions and eventual death serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of pride and rebellion. The mention of Geshur highlights the complex political landscape of the time, where marriages were often used to secure peace and alliances. Absalom's life and actions also foreshadow the internal strife that would plague David's kingdom, reflecting the broader theme of the challenges of leadership and the fulfillment of God's promises amidst human failings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chileab.htm">Chileab</a></b><br>The second son of David, born to Abigail.

By naming Chileab through the wise Abigail and Absalom through the politically connected Maacah, the Spirit sets the stage for future blessings and conflicts in David&#8217;s house. Chileab&#8217;s quiet disappearance underscores God&#8217;s hidden workings; Abigail&#8217;s background highlights grace; Absalom&#8217;s placement warns of rebellion; Maacah&#8217;s lineage reveals the costs of strategic marriages. Together the verse reminds us that every family detail is woven into God&#8217;s faithful plan for the Messianic line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chileab</span>. The Midrash explains Chileab as meaning "Quite like the father." He is called Daniel in the parallel genealogy in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>, and this was probably his real name, and Chileab a name of affection. He must have died young, for Adonijah appears as David's eldest son after the death of Amnon and Absalom; and it is thus natural that he should still be known by the name he bore as a child. <span class="cmt_word">Geshur</span>. The word signifies "Bridgeland," and is the name of two districts, one of which formed the northern part of the tribe of Manasseh, and extended on both sides of the Jordan, from the little Hermon to the sea of Gennesareth (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>). The other was in Syria (<a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), and probably was situated upon some river, though its exact position is not yet known. Talmai, its king, now gave his daughter to be one of David's wives, and though he was probably only a petty prince, still it is a proof of David's growing power that a potentate living at so great a distance was willing to make an alliance with him. Of the other wives and their sons nothing is known except of Adonijah, who inherited, on the death of Absalom, the dangerous position of firstborn; and who, after trying to make his rights good, was put to death by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As Eglah is especially called David's wife,</span> the Jewish interpreters hold that she was the highest in rank in his household, and therefore identical with Michal, who was restored to David while at Hebron. But she was childless; and more probably the words are to be taken as simply closing the narrative, and as belonging, therefore, equally to each of the six. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">his second</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;n&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
