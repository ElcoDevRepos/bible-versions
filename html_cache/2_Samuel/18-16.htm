Joab, as the commander of David's army, used this to communicate with his troops. The shofar is also used in various religious contexts, such as the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), symbolizing a call to repentance and reflection. In the context of battle, it served as a clear auditory signal that could be heard over the chaos of combat.<p><b>and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel</b><br>The troops here refer to David's forces, who were pursuing the forces of Absalom, David's son, who had rebelled against him. The pursuit was part of a larger civil conflict within Israel, highlighting the internal strife and division that plagued David's reign. The breaking off of the pursuit indicates a strategic decision to cease further bloodshed, possibly to prevent unnecessary loss of life among fellow Israelites, reflecting a desire for reconciliation and unity.<p><b>because Joab had restrained them</b><br>Joab's restraint of the troops demonstrates his authority and control as a military leader. It also reflects his complex character; while he was often ruthless, he also showed moments of strategic wisdom. Joab's actions here can be seen as a type of Christ, who restrains judgment and offers mercy. This restraint may also have been influenced by David's earlier command to deal gently with Absalom, though Joab ultimately disobeyed this command by killing Absalom. This tension between obedience and personal judgment is a recurring theme in Joab's life and leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless decisions.

With the rebellion&#8217;s leader gone, Joab chooses sound over sword to finish the conflict.<p>&#8226; The blast reminds us that God values order even amid war; clear leadership can spare needless loss (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a> exemplifies the broader principle of divine order).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s men had routed Absalom&#8217;s army, inflicting heavy casualties&#8212;twenty thousand in the forest of Ephraim (<a href="/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Israel&#8221; here refers to the northern tribes rallied by Absalom. Though technically the enemy at that moment, they were still fellow covenant people.<p>&#8226; By halting, David&#8217;s soldiers display obedience and restraint, echoing earlier moments when pursuit was curtailed for mercy&#8217;s sake (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4-7</a>; 26:8-11).<p>&#8226; Ceasing the chase avoids turning a military victory into a civil bloodbath, preserving future unity under the king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because Joab had restrained them</b><p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s authority carried weight; one command checked thousands of battle-hardened men (<a href="/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a> compares David&#8217;s earlier order, showing the chain of command).<p>&#8226; Though Joab disobeyed David&#8217;s wish to spare Absalom, he now prevents further vengeance. His complex leadership mixes severity and pragmatism (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>; 20:22).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;restrained&#8221; underscores deliberate control.
