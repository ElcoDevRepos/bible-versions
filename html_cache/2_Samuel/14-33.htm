His actions reflect his loyalty to King David and his strategic mind. Joab's intervention is significant because it demonstrates the political and familial complexities within David's reign. Joab's decision to inform the king indicates his understanding of the delicate balance between justice and mercy, a recurring theme in David's life. This moment also highlights Joab's influence in the royal court, as he often acts as an intermediary in David's personal and political affairs.<p><b>and David summoned Absalom</b><br>David's summoning of Absalom marks a pivotal moment in their strained relationship. Absalom had been in exile after avenging his sister Tamar by killing Amnon, David's firstborn. This act of summoning signifies David's willingness to reconcile, despite the unresolved tension and the potential threat Absalom poses to his throne. The act of summoning also reflects the cultural importance of family and the king's role as a father figure, balancing justice with familial duty. This moment foreshadows the future conflict between David and Absalom, as Absalom's ambitions and David's hesitations will lead to further turmoil.<p><b>who came to him and bowed facedown before him</b><br>Absalom's act of bowing facedown is a gesture of submission and respect, acknowledging David's authority as king. This act is culturally significant, as bowing was a common practice to show deference to a superior. However, given the context of their relationship, this gesture may also be seen as a strategic move by Absalom to regain favor and position within the royal court. The bowing can be interpreted as a temporary reconciliation, but it also sets the stage for Absalom's future rebellion, highlighting the tension between outward appearances and inner intentions.<p><b>Then the king kissed Absalom</b><br>The kiss from David symbolizes forgiveness and acceptance, a gesture of reconciliation and restoration of Absalom into the royal family. In the cultural context, a kiss was a sign of peace and goodwill, often used to seal agreements or express familial affection. This act of kissing Absalom can be seen as David's attempt to heal the rift between them, despite the underlying issues that remain unresolved. The kiss also serves as a poignant reminder of David's complex role as both a father and a king, struggling to balance personal emotions with his responsibilities as a ruler. This moment foreshadows the tragic events that will unfold, as Absalom's ambitions ultimately lead to conflict and sorrow within David's household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, who played a crucial role in reconciling David and Absalom.

Here, Joab&#8217;s report opens the door for grace to flow.<p>&#8226; In New-Covenant language, this foreshadows the ministry of reconciliation&#8212;servants urging peace between estranged parties (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and David summoned Absalom</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and he summoned Absalom.&#8230;&#8221; (14:33b)<p>&#8226; Two full years had passed since Absalom returned to Jerusalem yet never saw his father&#8217;s face (14:28).

Outward submission alone never guarantees inward repentance (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us to test our motives: &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the king kissed Absalom</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Then the king kissed Absalom.&#8221; (14:33d)<p>&#8226; In ancient culture a royal kiss sealed acceptance (<a href="/genesis/45-15.htm">Genesis 45:15</a>, Joseph and his brothers).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s embrace parallels the father running to the prodigal&#8212;&#8220;he embraced him and kissed him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace is extended, yet unresolved sin will still bear fruit. Absalom&#8217;s later revolt underscores that forgiveness never cancels accountability (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Even so, the kiss pictures the Lord&#8217;s eagerness to restore: &#8220;Mercy and truth have met together&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joab&#8217;s mediation leads David to act, David&#8217;s call brings Absalom near, Absalom&#8217;s bow shows outward humility, and the king&#8217;s kiss offers full acceptance.

But God's pardon was immediate (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), while David's was unwilling, and wrung from him. The kiss, we may feel quite sure, was preceded by a conversation between David and his son, the record of which is omitted simply for the sake of brevity. Evidently it satisfied the king, and ended in the kiss which gave the son all he desired. But whatever may have been his professions, Absalom's subsequent conduct is proof that he still regarded Amnon's death as a just retribution for his conduct to Tamar, and secretly cherished a sullen anger against his father for not having punished the wrong doer himself. It was the contrast between his own five years of punishment and the mere verbal reproof which was all that Amnon had to suffer for his shameless conduct, which rankled in Absalom's mind, and gave him an excuse for finally plotting his father's ruin. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
