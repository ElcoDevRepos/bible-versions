This location is significant as it is near the Valley of Rephaim, a frequent battleground between Israel and the Philistines. The name Baal-perazim means "Lord of Breakthroughs," indicating a place where God intervenes decisively. This event marks a turning point in David's military campaigns, showcasing his reliance on divine guidance.<p><b>where he defeated the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent threat to Israel, often challenging their sovereignty. David's victory here is not just a military success but a fulfillment of God's promise to establish his kingdom. This defeat of the Philistines demonstrates God's favor upon David and his role as the chosen king. It also foreshadows the eventual subjugation of the Philistines under David's rule, as seen in later chapters.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.&#8221;</b><br>David attributes his victory to the LORD, using the metaphor of a bursting flood to describe the overwhelming and unstoppable nature of God's intervention. This imagery reflects the sudden and powerful defeat of the Philistines, emphasizing that it was God's power, not merely human effort, that secured the victory. This acknowledgment of divine assistance is a recurring theme in David's life, highlighting his dependence on God.<p><b>So he called that place Baal-perazim</b><br>By naming the place Baal-perazim, David memorializes the event as a testament to God's deliverance. This act of naming serves as a reminder to future generations of God's faithfulness and power. It also reinforces the idea that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people, providing breakthroughs in times of need. This naming practice is common in the Old Testament, where significant events are often commemorated by naming locations, as seen with places like Bethel and Gilgal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God and his military prowess.

It is called Mount Perazim, "the hill of breaches," in Psalm 28:21, and as we have seen, it was the rocky height on the north of the valley of Rephaim. David must, therefore, have stolen round the army of the Philistines, creeping, probably by night, up to this ridge of Ben-Hinnom, and thence at the dawn of day have rushed down upon the camp. And his onset was sudden and irresistible, like the rush of the waters of some mountain lake when, swollen with rains, it bursts through the opposing dam, and carries hasty destruction to everything that lies in its way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
