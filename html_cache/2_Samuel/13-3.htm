Friendship in ancient Israel often implied a close and influential relationship. Jonadab, being a cousin to Amnon, would have had access to the royal family and its inner workings. The term "friend" in this context suggests a confidant or advisor, which is significant given the events that follow. This relationship sets the stage for the unfolding narrative of deceit and manipulation.<p><b>the son of David&#8217;s brother Shimeah</b><br>Jonadab is identified as the son of Shimeah, David's brother, making him a member of the royal family. This familial connection highlights the interconnectedness of the royal household and the potential for internal strife. The mention of Shimeah roots Jonadab within the broader family dynamics of David's lineage, which is marked by both loyalty and rivalry. This context is crucial for understanding the influence Jonadab wields and the trust placed in him by Amnon.<p><b>Jonadab was a very shrewd man</b><br>The description of Jonadab as "shrewd" indicates his cunning and strategic thinking. In biblical terms, shrewdness can have both positive and negative connotations, often depending on the outcome of one's actions. Here, it foreshadows Jonadab's role in advising Amnon in a morally questionable manner. This characteristic aligns with other biblical figures who use their intelligence for manipulation, such as the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Jonadab's shrewdness is pivotal in the narrative, as it leads to the tragic events that follow, highlighting the potential dangers of misused wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The firstborn son of King David, who harbored sinful desires towards his half-sister Tamar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab.htm">Jonadab</a></b><br>A cousin of Amnon and a son of Shimeah, David's brother.

The very next sentence introduces his &#8220;friend.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Friendship is a gift, yet this scene warns how the wrong companion can steer a heart in sinful directions. <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a> cautions, &#8220;He who walks with the wise will become wise, but the companion of fools will be destroyed&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Notice Amnon&#8217;s vulnerability: rather than seeking counsel from his father or a godly advisor, he turns to someone who will validate his desires. Compare <a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a>, where Rehoboam&#8217;s peers coax him into folly.<p>&#8226; This moment invites reflection on the voices we allow near our decisions. As <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> reminds, &#8220;Do not be deceived: &#8216;Bad company corrupts good character&#8217;&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of David&#8217;s brother Shimeah</b><p>&#8226; Jonadab is family&#8212;Amnon&#8217;s cousin&#8212;giving him automatic access and influence within the royal household. Family ties can be a blessing, yet they do not guarantee spiritual wisdom; Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph&#8217;s brothers all prove this (<a href="/bsb/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>; 25; 37).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly highlights the tangled dynamics inside David&#8217;s polygamous family. Multiple wives produced half-siblings whose relationships were complicated, setting the stage for rivalry and tragedy (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>&#8217;s warning to kings).<p>&#8226; Even for us, shared blood or long history should never substitute for discernment.

In Jonadab&#8217;s case, the context shows a crafty mind unhindered by moral restraint.<p>&#8226; Jonadab quickly devises a scheme for Amnon to satisfy his lust (<a href="/2_samuel/13-4.htm">2 Samuel 13:4-5</a>). His counsel is intelligent yet wicked&#8212;earthly &#8220;wisdom&#8221; described in <a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a> as &#8220;earthly, unspiritual, demonic.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus urged His disciples to be &#8220;shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>). Jonadab illustrates what shrewdness looks like when innocence is absent.<p>&#8226; Lessons:<p>&#8211; Talent divorced from truth becomes dangerous.<p>&#8211; Advice should be weighed not merely by brilliance but by righteousness (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p>&#8211; God grants insight to build up, never to manipulate or harm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The single verse sketches a cautionary triangle: Amnon&#8217;s vulnerable heart, Jonadab&#8217;s cunning counsel, and the close family bond that grants influence. Friendship, family, and intellect are good gifts, yet each must be governed by God&#8217;s truth. When any operate outside His boundaries, tragedy follows&#8212;as the rest of <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a> sadly confirms.
