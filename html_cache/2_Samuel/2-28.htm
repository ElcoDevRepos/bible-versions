The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, was a traditional signal in ancient Israel used for various purposes, including calling assemblies, signaling the start or end of a battle, or marking significant religious events. In this context, it signifies the cessation of hostilities. The use of the shofar is deeply rooted in Israelite culture, as seen in other biblical events such as the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>). Joab's authority to command the troops and his decision to end the pursuit reflect his leadership role and the respect he commanded among the soldiers.<p><b>and all the troops stopped;</b><br>The immediate obedience of the troops to Joab's signal indicates the discipline and order within David's army. This moment highlights the importance of leadership and the chain of command in military operations. The troops' cessation of action upon hearing the horn demonstrates their loyalty and the effectiveness of Joab's command. This obedience can be contrasted with other biblical instances where lack of discipline led to chaos, such as in the case of Saul's army in <a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-46</a>.<p><b>they no longer pursued Israel</b><br>The phrase "pursued Israel" refers to the conflict between the forces loyal to David and those loyal to Saul's house, led by Abner. This pursuit was part of the larger struggle for the throne of Israel following Saul's death. The cessation of pursuit signifies a temporary halt in the civil war, which was marked by complex loyalties and political maneuvering. This moment of pause in the conflict foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's kingship, fulfilling God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-5</a>).<p><b>or continued to fight.</b><br>The end of fighting indicates a momentary peace, though the underlying tensions between the house of Saul and the house of David remained. This cessation of hostilities allowed for a period of reflection and regrouping for both sides. Theologically, this can be seen as a step towards the fulfillment of God's plan for Israel, as David's eventual reign would bring about a united kingdom. The cessation of fighting also reflects the biblical theme of peace and reconciliation, which is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David, though often acting with personal ambition.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/ram's_horn.htm">Ram&#8217;s Horn (Shofar)</a></b><br>A traditional instrument used in ancient Israel for signaling, often in military contexts or religious ceremonies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/troops.htm">Troops</a></b><br>Refers to the soldiers under Joab's command, who were engaged in battle against the forces of Israel led by Abner.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>In this context, the forces loyal to Saul's house, specifically under the leadership of Abner, Saul's cousin and commander.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between the forces of David and those loyal to Saul, representing the struggle for kingship over Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_leadership.htm">The Power of Leadership</a></b><br>Joab's decision to blow the ram's horn demonstrates the influence a leader has over their followers.

The troops respect Joab&#8217;s signal because it represents divinely appointed structure (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), even on a battlefield.<p>&#8226; Their halt also fulfills Abner&#8217;s earlier request for restraint, showing how a single act of leadership can reverse escalating violence (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they no longer pursued Israel</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they no longer pursued Israel&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>c)<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s men&#8212;though loyal to David&#8212;recognize that the opposing troops are still fellow Israelites.

Family conflict must be restrained before it destroys everyone involved (<a href="/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The choice to cease pursuit mirrors God&#8217;s heart for reconciliation among His people (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or continued to fight</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or continued to fight.&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>d)<p>&#8226; Hostilities end entirely&#8212;no sporadic skirmishes, no lingering vendettas.
