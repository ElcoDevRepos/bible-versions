"LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and sovereignty. The title "God of Israel" underscores His special relationship with the nation of Israel, chosen as His people. This reflects the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His people throughout history.<p><b>have revealed this to Your servant</b><br>The term "revealed" indicates divine communication, often through prophecy or direct revelation. In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, God reveals His covenant with David through the prophet Nathan. This revelation is significant as it establishes the Davidic Covenant, promising that David's lineage will endure forever. The use of "Your servant" reflects David's humility and submission to God's will, recognizing his role in God's divine plan.<p><b>when You said, &#8216;I will build a house for you.&#8217;</b><br>The promise to "build a house" for David is a play on words, as David initially intended to build a physical temple for God. Instead, God promises to establish a "house" or dynasty for David. This covenantal promise is foundational for the messianic hope in Israel, as it foretells the coming of a future king from David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The concept of a "house" also signifies stability, continuity, and divine blessing.<p><b>Therefore Your servant has found the courage to offer this prayer to You.</b><br>David's response to God's promise is one of gratitude and boldness in prayer. The assurance of God's covenant gives David the confidence to approach God with his petitions. This reflects a deep trust in God's faithfulness and an understanding of the privilege of prayer. The courage to pray is rooted in the certainty of God's promises and His unchanging nature, encouraging believers to approach God with confidence and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who desires to build a temple for God but is instead promised an everlasting dynasty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_of_hosts.htm">LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>Acknowledges God&#8217;s covenant relationship with the nation of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God&#8217;s message to David regarding the establishment of his house.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/davidic_covenant.htm">Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise that God makes to David, ensuring that his lineage will endure forever.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God&#8217;s promises are sure and steadfast.
