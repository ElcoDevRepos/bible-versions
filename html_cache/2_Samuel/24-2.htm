Joab is a significant figure in David's reign, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions. This phrase highlights the hierarchical structure of ancient Israel, where the king had authority over military leaders. Joab's presence with David indicates his trusted position, despite their complex relationship. This moment reflects the centralized power of the monarchy in Israel, contrasting with the earlier tribal confederation during the time of the Judges.<p><b>Go now throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba</b><br>The phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" is a common biblical expression denoting the entire land of Israel, from its northernmost city, Dan, to its southernmost city, Beersheba. This indicates a comprehensive survey of the nation. Dan, located near the modern-day Golan Heights, and Beersheba, in the Negev desert, mark the traditional boundaries of Israelite territory. This command to survey the tribes underscores the unity of the nation under David's rule, a significant development from the tribal divisions seen earlier in Israel's history.<p><b>and register the troops</b><br>David's command to register the troops involves taking a census of the fighting men. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, censuses were often conducted for military or taxation purposes. This action, however, is controversial within the biblical narrative, as it suggests a reliance on military strength rather than trust in God. The act of counting the troops can be seen as a lack of faith, as Israel's victories were traditionally attributed to divine intervention rather than numerical superiority.<p><b>so that I may know their number</b><br>David's desire to know the number of his troops reflects a king's practical need for military preparedness. However, this desire is also seen as a potential act of pride or self-reliance, which contrasts with the biblical theme of dependence on God. The census becomes a pivotal moment in the narrative, leading to divine displeasure and subsequent consequences for Israel. This phrase invites reflection on the tension between human initiative and divine sovereignty, a recurring theme in the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who orders the census of the troops.

Believers are reminded to place their trust in God rather than in their own abilities or resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>The census is an act of pride, and it leads to severe consequences for David and Israel. This serves as a warning against pride and self-reliance, encouraging humility and dependence on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_accountability.htm">Leadership and Accountability</a></b><br>As a leader, David's actions have significant repercussions for the entire nation.

David gives no such instruction here.<p>&#8226; The target group is &#8220;the troops,&#8221; suggesting a military census meant to gauge national strength. <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a> cautions, &#8220;He takes no pleasure in the strength of the horse,&#8221; yet David seems bent on quantifying power.<p>&#8226; Joab himself senses the danger and protests (<a href="/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a>), highlighting that even hard-nosed Joab knows God&#8217;s hand, not headcount, secures victory (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that I may know their number</b><p>&#8226; The motive surfaces: &#8220;that I may know.&#8221; Trust shifts from the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to human statistics. <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a> warns, &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pride lurks beneath the request. Earlier, David refused to count those under twenty (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a>) because he trusted God&#8217;s promise of innumerable offspring; now he craves exact figures.<p>&#8226; The desire to &#8220;know&#8221; foreshadows the disaster that follows: 70,000 die (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>). Numbers gained by distrust end up demonstrating that safety rests only in obedience (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David commands Joab to conduct a nationwide military census, covering every tribe, driven by a personal need to quantify power rather than rely on God&#8217;s promise. The verse exposes a moment when a righteous king leans on statistics instead of the Sovereign Lord, illustrating how prideful self-reliance invites judgment and how even legitimate authority must remain submitted to God&#8217;s revealed will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the king said;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and the king said.</span> David's command was not the cause of Jehovah's auger, but the result of his having himself given way to ambition; and, as he yielded to the temptation, it so far became an act of Satan, in that it led to sin; but in its final result it led to good, in that the chastisement cured the people of their thirst for war. And as Satan can act only so far as the Divine will permits, the temptation was most truly the doing of Jehovah (but see note on 1 Samuel 26:19). <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the host, which was with him.</span> There is a good deal of difficulty about this passage, as the word for "host" is not that elsewhere used, and the last phrase is somewhat meaningless. In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a> we find "David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people." Without the concurrence of these rulers, who were the princes of the tribes, the census could not have been taken. But as the ancient versions confirm the reading of the Hebrew here, no change of the text is admissible. <span class="cmt_word">Number ye.</span> This is distinctly the war word, for which see note on 2 Samuel 18:1. It proves that the census was taken for military reasons. Even this in itself was not wrong (<a href="/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>), but it is indicative of David's purpose. When, moreover, Moses numbered the people, the census was taken by the priests (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1, 2</a>), and from the payment of the half shekel to the sanctuary, it appears that it was to some extent a religious ceremony. All this David neglects, and the employment of Joab goes far to prove that what David wanted was an examination of the military resources of his kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
