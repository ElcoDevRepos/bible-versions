The victory, which should have been a cause for celebration, became a time of mourning. This reflects the deep personal conflict within David, as he grieved the loss of his son despite the political victory. The people, who had fought for David, shared in his sorrow, highlighting the communal nature of grief in ancient Israel. This situation underscores the complexity of leadership and the personal sacrifices that often accompany it.<p><b>because on that day they were told</b><br>The communication of the king's grief to the people indicates the importance of information dissemination in the ancient world. The phrase suggests a formal announcement or widespread knowledge of the king's emotional state. This reflects the hierarchical structure of communication in a monarchy, where the king's emotions and decisions directly impacted the morale and actions of the people. It also shows the interconnectedness of the king's personal life with the public life of the nation.<p><b>&#8220;The king is grieving over his son.&#8221;</b><br>David's grief over Absalom is a poignant moment that reveals his deep paternal love, despite Absalom's rebellion. This reflects the biblical theme of forgiveness and unconditional love, reminiscent of the parable of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>. David's mourning can also be seen as a type of Christ's sorrow over Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>), where Jesus laments the city's rejection of Him. The king's grief serves as a reminder of the personal cost of sin and rebellion, and the heartache it brings to relationships, even within a royal family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of his son Absalom.

Leadership carries profound influence: David&#8217;s personal mourning shaped national emotion, reminding us that our private responses have public impact (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/19-2.htm">2 Samuel 19:2</a> records how a military victory instantly became a day of communal mourning because the people learned that their king was devastated over Absalom&#8217;s death. The verse teaches that shared life with godly leadership means victories and sorrows are felt together, that the heart of a leader can set the tone for an entire community, and that God&#8217;s people are called to enter into one another&#8217;s joys and griefs with genuine compassion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The victory</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">the salvation</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that day was</span> turned <span class="cmt_word">into mourning.</span> Naturally, the people did not understand the poignant emotions caused by the activity of David's conscience, and were pained at this seeming ingratitude to them for their brave exertions in his behalf, and at what they must have regarded as indifference to the welfare of the nation. Nor would it be easy for us to understand his conduct during the flight from Jerusalem, and in bearing Shimei's imprecations so tamely, did we not find in the psalms written at this time that David was suffering extreme and even excessive self-reproach and mental anguish at his past sin. It was a relief to bear Shimei's rudeness, for God might remember it for good. Racked thus with self-reproach, he had urged upon his generals to spare the young man (<a href="/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>), whose sin was part of a web which he had himself begun to spin, and in terror he waited for the result. Mentally it would have been better for him if he had gone to the battle instead of sitting in gloomy self-reproach between the gates. His eager inquiries, "Is the lad safe? meant - Has the hand of justice again smitten me? and when he found that a second blow had fallen, his self control gave way. Joab, more statesmanlike, and with his personal feelings unmoved, notices the fresh wrong that David is committing, and is vexed at seeing his brave warriors slink into Mahanaim ashamed, instead of being welcomed with deserved praise. But their conduct in being so depressed at David's sorrow is a proof of their affection for him, and it was plainly his duty to master his feelings, and to think of making a due return for the great service they had rendered him. The Hebrew word "salvation," that is, deliverance, gives the better side of the idea, while "victory" is a coarser word, taken from the language of a people whose trade was war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
