The establishment of Israel as a nation is rooted in the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), where God promised Abraham that his descendants would become a great nation. This covenant was reaffirmed to Isaac and Jacob, and it is through Jacob's twelve sons that the tribes of Israel were formed. The establishment of Israel is not merely a political or ethnic identity but a divine act of setting apart a people for God's purposes. This is further emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a holy people chosen by God.<p><b>as Your very own forever</b><br>The phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's covenant with Israel. Despite Israel's repeated disobedience and the subsequent exiles, the promise of being God's people remains. This eternal aspect is seen in the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The concept of "forever" points to the ultimate fulfillment in the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is from the line of David and whose kingdom is everlasting (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). This eternal relationship is also echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>, where God assures that Israel will never cease to be a nation before Him.<p><b>and You, O LORD, have become their God</b><br>This phrase signifies the reciprocal relationship between God and Israel. It is not only that Israel is God's people, but God is also their God, indicating a mutual commitment. This relationship is central to the Mosaic Covenant, where God declares, "I will take you as My people, and I will be your God" (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). The acknowledgment of God as their God involves worship, obedience, and a distinct way of life as outlined in the Law given at Sinai. This relationship is a type of the New Covenant, where believers in Christ are called to be God's people, and He is their God (<a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>). The phrase also reflects the personal and communal aspect of faith, where God is not just a distant deity but intimately involved in the lives of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desires to build a house for God, but God instead makes a covenant with him, promising that his lineage will endure forever.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He has established as His own forever, signifying a perpetual covenant relationship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who establishes His people and promises to be their God eternally.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to David regarding the establishment of his kingdom and the future of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise made by God to David, ensuring the establishment of his throne and kingdom forever.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's establishment of Israel as His people demonstrates His unwavering faithfulness to His promises.

Understanding who we are in God shapes our purpose and direction in life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>The promise of an eternal relationship with God encourages believers to live with an eternal perspective, focusing on the things of God rather than temporary worldly concerns.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_prophets.htm">Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Nathan's role in delivering God's message to David highlights the importance of listening to God's messengers.

This plainly refers to [he settlement in Canaan, now at last completed by David's victories, and not to the deliverance from Egypt. In the words that follow David recognizes the spiritual importance, not only of the permanent continuance of his house, but also of the empire given unto him. For Israel is now to be <span class="cmt_word">a people forever: and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</span> It is very necessary to retain here the personal name, Jehovah, as it is in the Hebrew, and not dilute it down to the <span class="accented">Lord</span> of the Septuagint. For now, to David's mind, the covenant seemed complete, and ratified forever. Israel is to have an everlasting existence - a promise belonging to it in its full sense only spiritually. For as long as the world lasts, it is against the spiritual Israel that the gates of hell shall never prevail. And next, first as the theocratic people, and then as the Church, it is to hold a unique relation to Jehovah, who is to be its God. For Israel, that is, the Jewish and the Christian Church, worships, not the God of nature, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, but <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the God of grace; and they learn his attributes, not from philosophy, nor by metaphysical inquiry, but from his own revealed will, in which he teaches us what he is, what we are, and how we are to become one with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For You have established</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
