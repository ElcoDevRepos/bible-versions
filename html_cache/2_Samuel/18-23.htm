His determination reflects a sense of duty and loyalty. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, messengers played a crucial role in communication, especially during times of war. Ahimaaz's insistence may also indicate his desire to bring good news, as he had previously been a trusted messenger (<a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17-21</a>). His eagerness can be seen as a metaphor for the zeal believers should have in sharing the gospel.<p><b>&#8220;Then run!&#8221; Joab told him.</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, grants Ahimaaz permission to run, despite having already sent the Cushite. Joab's decision may reflect his understanding of Ahimaaz's capabilities and his relationship with David. Joab's role as a military leader often involved making strategic decisions, and his interactions with messengers were part of his duties. This moment highlights the importance of obedience and the chain of command, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><b>So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain</b><br>Ahimaaz chooses a route that allows him to run swiftly, indicating his knowledge of the terrain. The plain likely refers to the Jordan Valley, a flat area conducive to fast travel. This geographical insight underscores the strategic considerations in ancient warfare and communication. The choice of route can also symbolize the path of righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26-27</a>, where believers are encouraged to choose the straight path.<p><b>and outran the Cushite.</b><br>Ahimaaz's ability to outrun the Cushite demonstrates his physical prowess and determination. The Cushite, likely an Ethiopian, represents a foreigner in David's service, highlighting the diverse makeup of his army. This detail reflects the historical context of David's reign, where alliances and diverse personnel were common. Ahimaaz's success in outrunning the Cushite can be seen as a type of Christ, who surpasses all others in bringing the message of salvation, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, where believers are encouraged to run the race with endurance, looking to Jesus as the ultimate example.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>The son of Zadok the priest, known for his swiftness and eagerness to deliver messages.

The large slaughter of twenty thousand men (ver. 7) proves that the defeated rebels were vigorously followed. In carrying the news he evidently went back by the route which the troops had followed; while Ahimaaz took a longer course to the west, but one that avoided the tangles and the deep defiles of the forest. Strictly, the Kikkar, as we have seen, was the name of the Jordan valley near Jericho; but it was probably applicable also to the same sort of formation further north. On approaching Mahanaim, Ahimaaz would strike inland, and the two routes would join one another; and one reason which made Ahimaaz go more to the west was that he did net wish the Cushite to know that he had a rival. He would thus go at a steady pace, picking his way through the forest, while Ahimaaz was using his utmost speed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;No matter what,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I want to run!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7323.htm">Strong's 7323: </a> </span><span class="str2">To run</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he replied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
