This location is significant as it was a common crossing point, indicating a return to normalcy after the upheaval of Absalom's rebellion. The Jordan River often symbolizes transitions and new beginnings in the Bible, such as the Israelites entering the Promised Land (Joshua 3).<p><b>to carry over the king&#8217;s household</b><br>David's household included his family, servants, and loyal followers. This act of carrying them over signifies the restoration of David's reign and the re-establishment of his authority. It reflects the loyalty and support of those who remained faithful to him during Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>and to do what was good in his sight</b><br>This phrase indicates a willingness to serve and please the king, highlighting the loyalty and submission of David's followers. It reflects the biblical principle of serving leaders as unto the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>) and the importance of aligning actions with the will of God-appointed authority.<p><b>When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan</b><br>Shimei, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, had previously cursed David during his flight from Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). His crossing of the Jordan to meet David signifies a change in attitude, possibly motivated by fear or genuine repentance. This act is a fulfillment of the biblical theme of reconciliation and forgiveness.<p><b>he fell down before the king</b><br>Shimei's act of falling down before David is a gesture of submission and repentance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, prostration was a common way to show respect and seek mercy from a superior. This act parallels the biblical theme of humbling oneself before God and seeking forgiveness, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, returning to Jerusalem after Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>Son of Gera, a Benjamite who previously cursed David but now seeks forgiveness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>The river that David and his household are crossing as they return to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>The event that led to David's temporary exile from Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_household.htm">The King's Household</a></b><br>Refers to David's family and servants who are returning with him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mercy_over_judgment.htm">Mercy Over Judgment</a></b><br>David's response to Shimei highlights the importance of showing mercy, even to those who have wronged us.

Some commentators do take this view, but it is contradicted by the latter part of ver. 17. Really the Hebrew words signify no more than "at his crossing the Jordan," that is, at some time or other during the passage. Shimei's course was not only the boldest, but also the wisest. For, in the first place, his prompt surrender would commend itself to David's generosity; and, secondly, had Abishai's counsel been taken, it would have offended the thousand Benjamites who formed his escort, and also all the warriors present there from Israel (see ver. 40). Trouble and discontent would certainly have followed upon any attempt on David's part to punish any of his enemies, and there might even have been armed resistance to his crossing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and crossed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
