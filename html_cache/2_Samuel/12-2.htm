This parable, told by the prophet Nathan, is a metaphor for David's actions regarding Bathsheba and Uriah. The rich man's wealth symbolizes David's power and resources as king. In biblical times, wealth was often measured by livestock, which were essential for food, clothing, and sacrifices. This imagery highlights the disparity between David's abundance and Uriah's limited resources.<p><b>had a great number of sheep and cattle</b><br>Sheep and cattle were significant assets in ancient Israel, representing wealth and prosperity. The mention of a "great number" emphasizes the extent of the rich man's resources, contrasting with the poor man's single ewe lamb in the parable. This abundance is symbolic of David's many blessings and privileges as king. In a broader biblical context, sheep often symbolize God's people (<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>), and cattle can represent material wealth (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>). The rich man's possession of many sheep and cattle underscores his responsibility to use his resources justly and compassionately, a responsibility David failed to uphold in his dealings with Uriah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich_man.htm">Rich Man</a></b><br>Represents those with abundance and wealth.
