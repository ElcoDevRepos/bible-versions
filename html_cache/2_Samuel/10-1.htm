Scripture often uses similar wording to move the story forward, as in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a> (&#8220;Some time later, David defeated the Philistines,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By linking chapters 9 and 10, the Spirit highlights how David&#8217;s consistent mercy&#8212;first toward Saul&#8217;s grandson, then toward a foreign nation&#8212;reflects the LORD&#8217;s covenant heart (compare <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative shift signals that the peace David had secured (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6, 14</a>) is about to be tested. God&#8217;s people should expect new challenges even after seasons of blessing (see <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king of the Ammonites died</b><p>&#8226; The king is Nahash, mentioned earlier for attacking Jabesh-gilead (<a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a>). Though hostile then, he later showed kindness to David (implied by <a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His death removes a stabilizing figure; <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a> notes, &#8220;When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan&#8221;. The Ammonites soon feel the tension of uncertain leadership.<p>&#8226; For Israel, Nahash&#8217;s passing reopens a relationship that had rested on personal goodwill rather than treaty law. It illustrates how the fate of nations often turns on the character of rulers (compare <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was succeeded by his son Hanun</b><p>&#8226; Hereditary succession was normal among the surrounding peoples (<a href="/1_kings/16-22.htm">1 Kings 16:22</a>). Yet a son&#8217;s reign did not guarantee continuity of the father&#8217;s policies; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a> laments that a successor may be &#8220;foolish&#8221; with an inherited kingdom.<p>&#8226; Hanun&#8217;s choices in verses 2-4 reveal a fear-driven insecurity, contrasting with David&#8217;s sincere overture of comfort. Where David acts out of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-2.htm">1 Chronicles 19:2</a>), Hanun listens to suspicious counselors&#8212;echoing Rehoboam&#8217;s later mistake (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift underscores <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>: a king&#8217;s success hinges on humility before the LORD. Hanun&#8217;s failure will draw his nation into devastating conflict (<a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1</a> sets the stage for a clash of kindness and paranoia. After a peaceful interval, the death of Nahash removes a friendly link to David. Hanun&#8217;s accession introduces untested leadership, reminding us that a single change in authority can alter the course of nations. The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s sovereignty over political transitions and to model steadfast mercy, knowing that leadership grounded in covenant faithfulness brings blessing, while fear-based rule courts disaster.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The king.</span>--His name is given in the next verse and in <a href="/1_chronicles/19-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.">1Chronicles 19:1</a>, as Nahash. He was probably a son or grandson of the Nahash whom Saul conquered (1 Samuel 11), as more than fifty years must have passed away since that event. The kindness he had shown to David is not recorded, but may have been some friendly help during his wanderings, or merely a congratulatory embassy on his accession.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king of the children of Ammon died.</span> This war is very briefly referred to in <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>; but we have now entered upon a narrative, the interest of which is altogether unlike all that has gone before. There we saw David crowned with earthly glory, and made the monarch of a vast empire; he is also a prophet, and, as such, not only restores, but enriches and enlarges, the worship of the sanctuary; and, as prophet and king, he becomes not only the type, but the ancestor of the Messiah. In this narrative he is a sinner, punished with terrible, though merited, severity, and must henceforth walk humbly and sorrowfully as a penitent before God. From <a href="/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1</a> we learn that the king's name was Nahash; but whether he was the same as the Nahash mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a> is uncertain. There was an interval of more than forty years between, but Nahash was probably a young man, just seated on the throne, when he attacked Jabesh-Gilead; and Saul, who repelled him, might have been still alive but for the battle of Gilbea. The name means a "serpent," and is used in Job 26:18 of the constellation Draco. It may thus have been a name assumed by several Ammonite kings, the dragon representing majesty and power, and being the symbol on their seal, just as it is the Chinese imperial emblem now. The phrase, "It came to pass after this," has no chronological significance either here or in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. It is simply a form of transition from one subject to another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Some time later,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Ammonites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">died</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
