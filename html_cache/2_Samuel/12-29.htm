This phrase indicates his role as a military leader and his ability to mobilize the entire army. The assembling of troops signifies a united effort, reflecting the unity of Israel under David's leadership. This action follows Nathan's confrontation with David over his sin with Bathsheba, showing David's return to his kingly duties. The gathering of troops also highlights the importance of collective action in achieving victory, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the battles led by Joshua.<p><b>and went to Rabbah;</b><br>Rabbah was the capital city of the Ammonites, located in present-day Amman, Jordan. It was a significant city due to its strategic location and resources. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, and their relationship with Israel was often contentious. David's campaign against Rabbah was part of a larger conflict with the Ammonites, which began in <a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>. The city was well-fortified, making its capture a notable military achievement. This action also fulfilled God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>.<p><b>and he fought against it</b><br>David's direct involvement in the battle underscores his commitment to his role as king and warrior. This phrase indicates that David was not just a distant commander but actively participated in the military campaign. His presence would have been a morale booster for the troops. The act of fighting against Rabbah can be seen as a form of divine justice, as the Ammonites had previously humiliated David's envoys (<a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-5</a>). This engagement also reflects the biblical principle of confronting and overcoming evil, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>and captured it.</b><br>The capture of Rabbah marked a significant victory for Israel and demonstrated God's favor upon David despite his previous sins. This victory secured Israel's dominance over the Ammonites and expanded its territory. The capture of the city also fulfilled the prophetic words of Nathan, who had assured David of God's continued support (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). In a typological sense, David's victory can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as Christ is often depicted as a conquering king in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his leadership, military prowess, and his heart for God.
