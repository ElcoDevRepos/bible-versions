Travelers relied on the generosity of others for food and shelter. The rich man in this parable represents those with abundant resources, highlighting the expectation that he would provide for the traveler. This scenario sets the stage for a moral lesson, as the rich man's actions are contrasted with the expected norms of hospitality and generosity.<p><b>who refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle</b><br>The rich man's decision not to use his own resources underscores his selfishness and greed. In biblical times, livestock was a sign of wealth and prosperity. The refusal to use his own sheep or cattle, despite having plenty, reveals a heart that is unwilling to sacrifice for others. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God calls His people to be generous and to care for the needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>.<p><b>to prepare for the traveler who had come to him</b><br>The preparation of a meal for a guest was a customary act of hospitality. The rich man's failure to use his own resources for this purpose highlights a moral failing. This act of preparation is symbolic of the spiritual and moral preparation expected of God's people, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where readiness and proper preparation are emphasized.<p><b>Instead, he took the poor man&#8217;s lamb</b><br>The poor man's lamb represents innocence and vulnerability. In the context of the parable, this act is a grave injustice, as the lamb was not only the poor man's possession but also a cherished part of his household. This mirrors the biblical theme of the exploitation of the weak by the powerful, a sin condemned by prophets like Amos (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>). The lamb can also be seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for the sins of humanity.<p><b>and prepared it for his guest.</b><br>The preparation of the poor man's lamb for the guest is the culmination of the rich man's selfishness and lack of compassion. This act of taking what little the poor man had and using it for his own purposes is a direct violation of the biblical call to love one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). It serves as a powerful illustration of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance, as later seen in David's own repentance in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and Uriah.

Thus Rashi explains it of covetousness, which comes at first as a mere "passer by," the literal meaning of the word rendered "traveller." But, if admitted, it grows into "a wayfaring man," who comes and goes on business, and stays a longer time. Finally it changes into "one who has come to him," and remains permanently. Such allegorical interpretations are common in the Fathers, and thus Augustine compares the three stages of sin to our Lord's three miracles of raising the dead. The sinner is at first like Jairus's daughter, just dead, and repentance can restore him immediately to life; but, if sin be persisted in, he becomes like the son of the widow of Nain, carried away to burial; and finally like Lazarus, given over to corruption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a traveler</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1982.htm">Strong's 1982: </a> </span><span class="str2">A journey, a wayfarer, a flowing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
