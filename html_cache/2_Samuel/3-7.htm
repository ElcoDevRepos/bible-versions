Rizpah, as a concubine of Saul, would have been under his protection and part of his legacy. Her father, Aiah, is mentioned, indicating her family background, which was often significant in establishing social status. Rizpah's story later in <a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8-14</a> highlights her loyalty and the tragic events surrounding her sons, showing her as a figure of maternal devotion and grief.<p><b>So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner,</b><br>Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was a weak king, often manipulated by Abner, the commander of Saul's army. This questioning indicates a power struggle and insecurity in Ish-bosheth's reign. Abner's role was crucial as he held military power and influence, often acting independently. This tension foreshadows the eventual shift of power to David, as Abner's loyalty wavers.<p><b>&#8220;Why did you sleep with my father&#8217;s concubine?&#8221;</b><br>Sleeping with a king's concubine was seen as a claim to the throne, as it symbolized taking over the king's harem and, by extension, his authority. This act was not just personal but political, suggesting Abner's possible ambitions or a challenge to Ish-bosheth's rule. This accusation reflects the instability and intrigue within Saul's house, contrasting with David's rise to power.

A royal concubine, a suspicious king, and an ambitious general collide, setting in motion the collapse of Ish-bosheth&#8217;s reign. By treating Saul&#8217;s concubine as his own, Abner appears to assert royal rights, prompting Ish-bosheth&#8217;s fearful question. The incident illustrates how God sovereignly uses even flawed human actions to advance His declared plan&#8212;moving the throne from Saul&#8217;s house to David&#8217;s, just as He had spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Rizpah.</span>--The name of this woman is associated with her strong and tender grief over the loss of her sons, recorded in <a href="/context/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8-11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Wherefore hast thou gone in?</span>--The harem of an Eastern monarch was considered as the property of his successor, and therefore the taking of a woman belonging to it as the assertion of a claim to the throne. (See <a href="/2_samuel/12-8.htm" title="And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to you such and such things.">2Samuel 12:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.">2Samuel 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm" title="And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.">1Kings 2:22</a>.) It is not probable that Abner had any such design, since he was exerting himself to maintain Ish-bosheth on the throne. But the king appears to have so regarded the act, as it is this implied charge of treachery that so greatly rouses the anger of Abner.
