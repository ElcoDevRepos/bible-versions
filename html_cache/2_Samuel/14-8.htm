The directive to "go home" suggests a temporary dismissal, indicating that the king needs time to consider her request. This reflects the cultural practice of deliberation in ancient Israel, where decisions, especially those involving justice, were not made hastily. The phrase also implies a level of assurance that the king is taking her plea seriously.<p><b>the king said to the woman,</b><br>The king here is David, who is known for his wisdom and justice, yet also for his personal failings. The woman is a wise figure, orchestrated by Joab to influence David's decision regarding Absalom. This interaction highlights the role of women in biblical narratives as instruments of divine or political intervention, similar to Abigail in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>. The use of a parable by the woman is reminiscent of Nathan's approach to David in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>, showing the power of storytelling in conveying truth.<p><b>&#8220;and I will give orders on your behalf.&#8221;</b><br>David's promise to give orders signifies his authority as king to enact justice and make decrees. This reflects the biblical theme of the king as a judge, responsible for maintaining justice and righteousness in the land, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>. The phrase also foreshadows David's eventual decision to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem, illustrating the tension between justice and mercy. This tension is a recurring theme in David's reign and points to the ultimate fulfillment of perfect justice and mercy in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, known for his heart after God, yet also for his personal and familial struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman from Tekoa, instructed by Joab to present a parable to King David to influence his decision regarding Absalom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander, who orchestrates the woman's appeal to David to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who had fled to Geshur after killing his brother Amnon, and whose return to Jerusalem is the subject of the woman's plea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tekoa.htm">Tekoa</a></b><br>A town in Judah, known for its wise inhabitants, including the prophet Amos.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_parables.htm">The Power of Parables</a></b><br>Parables can be a powerful tool to reveal truth and prompt reflection.

David concludes the initial interaction by sending the woman away, signaling that he has heard enough to act (cf. <a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a> where Jacob waits for an answer).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Home&#8221; represents a place of waiting in faith; the matter is now in the king&#8217;s hands (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>, &#8220;Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do it&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The directive also protects her anonymity, ensuring the parable can work without public scrutiny, just as Nathan&#8217;s earlier approach to David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;7</a> was discreet yet effective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king said to the woman,</b><p>&#8226; The focus shifts to the king&#8217;s sovereign voice. In Israel, a royal word carried binding authority (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>, &#8220;For the king&#8217;s word is supreme&#8221;).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s personal engagement models righteous leadership&#8212;he listens before ruling (cf. <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing &#8220;the woman,&#8221; David acknowledges her dignity, reflecting the biblical principle that all who seek justice are worthy of a hearing (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and I will give orders on your behalf.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David promises specific action: he will &#8220;give orders,&#8221; showing that true justice moves from hearing to decisive command (cf. <a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>, where Solomon&#8217;s verdict establishes justice).<p>&#8226; The commitment &#8220;on your behalf&#8221; reveals advocacy&#8212;an earthly picture of Christ&#8217;s mediating role (cf. <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, &#8220;He always lives to intercede for them&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Practically, David intends to tell Joab and the court to protect the woman&#8217;s son in the parable, which in reality prepares the ground for Absalom&#8217;s restoration (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-8.htm">2 Samuel 14:8</a> captures David&#8217;s just and compassionate response: he hears the plea, dismisses the petitioner to rest in confidence, and pledges authoritative intervention.
