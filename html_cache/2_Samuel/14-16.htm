In ancient Israel, the king was seen as God's representative on earth, responsible for upholding justice and righteousness (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>). The confidence in the king's ability to hear and act is rooted in the belief that he is guided by divine wisdom, as seen in Solomon's request for wisdom in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>.<p><b>and deliver his maidservant</b><br>The term "maidservant" indicates a position of humility and service. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a maidservant would have been a woman of low social standing, yet she appeals to the king for deliverance, highlighting the king's role as a protector of all his subjects, regardless of their status. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s concern for the lowly and oppressed, as seen in <a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>.<p><b>from the hand of the man</b><br>The "hand" symbolizes power and control. In biblical times, the hand was often used metaphorically to represent authority or oppression (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The plea for deliverance from "the hand of the man" suggests a situation of injustice or threat, which the king is expected to rectify.<p><b>who would cut off both me and my son</b><br>The phrase "cut off" implies a severe and permanent separation, often associated with death or exile. In the context of Israelite society, being cut off from one's people was a grave consequence, as it meant losing one's place and inheritance within the community (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). The mention of both the woman and her son emphasizes the threat to her family line and legacy.<p><b>from God&#8217;s inheritance.&#8217;</b><br>"Inheritance" in the biblical sense often refers to the land and blessings promised by God to the Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>). It also carries a spiritual connotation, representing the covenant relationship with God. The plea to be preserved in "God&#8217;s inheritance" underscores the importance of maintaining one's place within the covenant community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s faithfulness to His promises and the importance of remaining within His covenant, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his personal and familial struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman sent by Joab to speak to King David in a parable to convince him to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who orchestrates the plan to reconcile David with his estranged son, Absalom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who is in exile after killing his brother Amnon.

Cutting off a line meant erasing a family&#8217;s future, property, and name (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a>).
