His relationship with David was significant because David had made a covenant with Jonathan to show kindness to his family (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>). Mephibosheth's actions here demonstrate loyalty and respect towards King David, despite the political turmoil following Absalom's rebellion. This meeting took place as David was returning to Jerusalem after fleeing from Absalom, highlighting the restoration of David's kingship. The act of going down to meet the king signifies humility and submission, a common cultural practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies.<p><b>He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he returned safely.</b><br>This description of Mephibosheth's appearance is a sign of mourning and distress. In ancient Israel, neglecting personal grooming was a traditional expression of grief or loyalty during times of crisis (<a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11-12</a>). By not caring for his feet, trimming his mustache, or washing his clothes, Mephibosheth was publicly displaying his sorrow over David's absence and his solidarity with the king. This act can be seen as a form of protest against the usurpation of David's throne by Absalom. The mention of these specific actions underscores the depth of Mephibosheth's loyalty and the sincerity of his allegiance to David. This behavior also reflects the cultural customs of the time, where outward appearance was often used to convey inner emotions and social status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

Earlier, during David&#8217;s flight, Ziba had slandered Mephibosheth, claiming that the young man hoped to reclaim Saul&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1&#8211;4</a>). The verse now before us reveals the truth, correcting the earlier misrepresentation and highlighting Mephibosheth&#8217;s steadfast loyalty&#8212;just as Jonathan himself had once sworn covenant faithfulness to David (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mephibosheth goes down to meet the king</b><p>&#8220;Then Mephibosheth, Saul&#8217;s grandson, went down to meet the king&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The journey &#8220;down&#8221; implies submission and eagerness, similar to the way Shimei and others hurried to meet David (<a href="/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Despite his disability (<a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3</a>), Mephibosheth makes the effort personally, echoing the humility of the lame and weak who are invited to the King&#8217;s table (<a href="/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Neglected feet, mustache, and clothes&#8212;visible grief</b><p>&#8220;He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes&#8221; (19:24b).<p>&#8226; Neglecting personal grooming was a recognized sign of mourning (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16&#8211;18</a> shows the contrast with hypocritical display).<p>&#8226; Unwashed clothing mirrors David&#8217;s own barefoot, weeping ascent of the Mount of Olives during the crisis (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>).

The verse invites believers to persevere in visible, humble devotion while they await the triumphant, safe return of their King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Came down to meet.</span>--The obvious meaning of this is that Mephibosheth came down from the high land of Jerusalem to meet the king in the Jordan valley, and in this case the following verse should be translated, "And it came to pass when Jerusalem" (meaning its inhabitants, with Mephibosheth among them) "was come to meet the king." Some writers, however, prefer to keep <a href="/2_samuel/19-25.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why went not you with me, Mephibosheth?">2Samuel 19:25</a> as it is, and to suppose that during the rebellion Mephibosheth had taken refuge on his ancestral estate near the heights of Gibeah, and that he came thence to Jerusalem to meet David. In either case the signs of deep mourning used by Mephibosheth "from the day the king departed" were an evidence of his loyalty. The word for <span class= "ital">beard </span>is used only for the <span class= "ital">moustache.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mephibosheth</span>. The meeting of David and Mephibosheth possibly took place at Jerusalem (see on ver. 25), and, if so, the order of events is not chronological. Ziba certainly came to the Jordan fords, and the narrative may have been introduced here to complete the account of his doings. In neglecting his person and his dress, Mephibosheth was showing signs of heartfelt sorrow, and as he thus mourned during Absalom's tenure of power, it exposed him to the usurper's displeasure, and was a public avowal that his sympathies were with David. And his treatment was unjust; but David was in a strait. Ziba had been actively useful to him in his flight, and had also aided greatly in his recall. It was, probably, even owing to his influence that Shimei came with a thousand men of Benjamin. He deserved, therefore, a reward, but not at his master's cost. <span class="cmt_word">His beard;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the upper lip</span> (see <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>;
