Historically, Moab was located east of the Dead Sea. The defeat of the Moabites by David signifies the expansion of his kingdom and the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies. This victory also reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and Moab, which began during the Exodus (Numbers 22-24) and continued through the period of the Judges (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>).<p><b>made them lie down on the ground</b><br>This phrase indicates a position of submission and vulnerability. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, defeated enemies were often made to lie prostrate as a sign of their defeat and subjugation. This act symbolizes the complete control David had over the Moabites after their defeat.<p><b>and measured them off with a cord</b><br>Measuring with a cord was a method used to determine the fate of captives. This practice is not widely documented outside of this passage, but it suggests a systematic approach to dealing with the defeated Moabites. The use of a cord implies a deliberate and calculated decision-making process by David.<p><b>He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death</b><br>The decision to put two-thirds of the Moabite captives to death may seem harsh, but it reflects the brutal realities of ancient warfare. This act served as a deterrent to rebellion and ensured the security of David's kingdom. It also highlights the seriousness with which David approached the consolidation of his rule.<p><b>and with one length those to be spared</b><br>The sparing of one-third of the Moabites demonstrates a measure of mercy and pragmatism. By allowing some to live, David ensured that there would be a population left to serve and pay tribute, thus maintaining the economic stability of the region. This act of sparing also aligns with the biblical theme of mercy amidst judgment.<p><b>So the Moabites became subject to David</b><br>The subjugation of the Moabites under David's rule fulfilled the divine mandate for Israel to have dominion over its enemies. This subjugation is a precursor to the peace and prosperity that characterized David's reign and foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, who will have dominion over all nations.<p><b>and brought him tribute</b><br>Tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, where defeated nations paid goods or money to their conquerors as a sign of submission and allegiance. The tribute from the Moabites not only enriched David's kingdom but also demonstrated the fulfillment of God's promise to bless Israel and establish David's throne. This act of bringing tribute can be seen as a type of the homage that all nations will one day bring to Christ, the ultimate King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and leadership, who is central to this passage as he subdues the Moabites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with Israel.

The cause of his entire change of bearing towards them is not certainly known, but according to Jewish tradition the Moabites had proved false to their trust, and had put to death David's father and mother. This is not unlikely, as his parents are never mentioned again after they were left in Moab. Others think that the Moabites had been guilty of some treachery towards David in his war with the Syrians and Ammonites. The two suppositions are quite consistent, and both may have been true. Many writers see in this conquest at least a partial fulfilment of the prophecy in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">With two lines.</span>--This expression with the "one full line" of the next clause is equivalent to saying that David measured off the bodies of his prostrate enemies with a line divided into three equal parts. When they had been made to lie down upon the ground, side by side, the line was stretched over them. Such as were found under the two first parts of it were put to death, those under the third part were spared, thus two-thirds of all the Moabite men perished. There is no mention of this in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.">1Chronicles 18:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Brought gifts.</span>--A frequent euphemism for <span class= "ital">paid tribute. </span>(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2Samuel 8:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote Moab.</span> In the previous history we find David and Moab on such friendly terms that he entrusted his father and mother into their king's keeping (<a href="/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3, 4</a>). Now he not only subjugates them, but puts two-thirds or, according to the ancient versions, half of the captured combatants to death. Compared with the custom of the Romans, and with the attempt to destroy all the males in Edom, this was mild treatment; for we find Caesar in his Gallic wars putting all his prisoners to death, and using for their execution the mere phrase, "he counted them in the number of enemies," as if the killing of enemies was a matter of course. The customs of the Israelites in war were not so cruel, and this treatment of the Moabites seems to be mentioned as showing that they received exceptionally severe treatment. The justification of this is found by Jewish commentators, on the authority of the Midrash, in the supposed fact that the King of Moab had put David's father and mother to death. But as Philippson adds, even so it was an instance of the extreme barbarity of ancient warfare. <span class="cmt_word">Casting them down to the ground;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">making them to lie down on the ground</span>; and so the Revised Version. It is plain that those who were made to lie on the ground were combatants who had been made prisoners, and the Hebrew seems to mean that, while they were thus prostrate, they were measured off into three divisions, whereof two were put to the sword, and one permitted to live. All the versions, however, understand that only half were put to death, making the sense to be that he measured them with two cords, one to kill, and one full cord - one, that is, of larger size, to save alive. We get no help from <a href="/1_chronicles/18-2.htm">1 Chronicles 18:2</a>, where this treatment of the Moabites is omitted. It is probable that it was in this war that Benaiah slew "two lion-like men of Moab" (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>), who were its champions and perhaps members of the royal house. <span class="cmt_word">They brought gifts</span> means that they paid an annual tribute; but the phrase shows that, though now they were <span class="cmt_word">David's servants,</span> that is, <span class="accented">subjects</span>, yet that they were left in possession of their independence, and that their internal affairs were managed by native authorities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[David] also defeated</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
