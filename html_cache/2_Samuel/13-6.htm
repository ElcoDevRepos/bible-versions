This act of feigning illness is a premeditated plan to manipulate his father, King David, into granting him access to Tamar. The use of deceit here echoes the broader theme of sin and its consequences, which is prevalent throughout the narrative of David's family. This act of deception can be compared to other biblical instances where deceit leads to significant consequences, such as Jacob deceiving Isaac (Genesis 27).<p><b>When the king came to see him,</b><br>King David, as a father, shows concern for his son by visiting him. This reflects the familial relationships and responsibilities in ancient Israelite culture, where the king also acts as a father figure. David's visit indicates his unawareness of Amnon's true intentions, highlighting a recurring theme of blindness or ignorance to sin within one's own family, as seen in Eli's relationship with his sons (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-25</a>).<p><b>Amnon said, &#8220;Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight,</b><br>Amnon's request is specific and calculated, using familial terms to mask his ulterior motives. The mention of "cakes" refers to a type of bread or pastry, which in the cultural context, was a common food item. The request for Tamar to make them "in my sight" is a manipulative tactic to isolate her, setting the stage for his subsequent actions. This phrase foreshadows the violation of familial trust and the breakdown of moral order within David's house, reminiscent of the consequences of David's own sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11).<p><b>so that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</b><br>This request for Tamar to feed him directly is an intimate act, further illustrating Amnon's inappropriate intentions. In the cultural context, eating from someone's hand could signify trust and closeness, which Amnon exploits for his own desires. This act of betrayal within the family unit is a microcosm of the larger theme of sin's destructive power, as seen in the broader narrative of David's reign and its impact on his descendants. The violation of trust here parallels the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, where a close relationship is marred by treachery (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The eldest son of King David, who harbors an illicit desire for his half-sister Tamar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The daughter of King David and sister of Absalom, known for her beauty and innocence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel, father to both Amnon and Tamar, who is unwittingly drawn into Amnon's deceit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deception.htm">The Deception</a></b><br>Amnon feigns illness to manipulate his father and sister, setting the stage for his sinful actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_household.htm">The Royal Household</a></b><br>The setting is within the palace, highlighting the personal and familial nature of the events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often begins with deception, both of oneself and others.
