The "heart of a lion" symbolizes courage and strength, often associated with warriors like David himself (<a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). The imagery of a lion is used throughout Scripture to denote bravery and power (<a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>). The melting of such courage indicates the overwhelming nature of the threat posed by David and his men, reflecting the biblical principle that human strength is insufficient without divine support (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><b>because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man</b><br>David's reputation as a "mighty man" is well-established, dating back to his victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17). His military prowess and leadership are recognized throughout Israel, contributing to his legendary status. This acknowledgment of David's might serves as a reminder of God's anointing and favor upon him, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of reputation and legacy in biblical narratives, where past deeds influence present perceptions and decisions.<p><b>who has valiant men with him</b><br>David's "valiant men" refer to his loyal warriors, known as the "mighty men" or "Gibborim" (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>). These men were renowned for their bravery and skill in battle, forming an elite group that supported David throughout his reign. Their presence signifies the strength of unity and loyalty, themes prevalent in biblical accounts of Israel's history. The mention of these men also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member plays a crucial role in the mission of the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and leadership.

Lions may be fierce, but if God withdraws strength, even a lion-hearted warrior falters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will melt with fear</b><p>Fear &#8220;melting&#8221; is a familiar biblical picture of morale collapsing.<p>&#8226; Rahab reported that the Canaanites&#8217; &#8220;hearts melted&#8221; because they heard what God did at the Red Sea (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s own troops melted when Goliath taunted them (<a href="/1_samuel/17-24.htm">1 Samuel 17:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Hushai argues that Absalom&#8217;s forces will suffer the same paralysis once a single setback occurs, since fear spreads faster than courage (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man</b><p>David&#8217;s reputation is legendary and well earned.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a>) is still sung throughout Israel.<p>&#8226; His string of victories&#8212;beginning with Goliath and continuing through Moab, Edom, and the Arameans (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>)&#8212;marks him as a seasoned, divinely favored commander.<p>&#8226; By highlighting what &#8220;all Israel knows,&#8221; Hushai taps into national memory; the stories parents tell their children about David become a psychological weapon against Absalom&#8217;s army.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has valiant men with him</b><p>David is not isolated; he is surrounded by elite warriors whose loyalty is unwavering.<p>&#8226; The Three&#8212;Josheb-Basshebeth, Eleazar, and Shammah&#8212;once held their ground against hundreds (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Thirty more, including Benaiah who struck down a lion in a pit on a snowy day, form an inner circle of seasoned fighters (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Additional support arrives from every tribe (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23-40</a>), proving that numbers, experience, and devotion are all on David&#8217;s side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hushai&#8217;s statement is calculated to paralyze Absalom&#8217;s confidence.

Scripture consistently records that when God stands behind His anointed, even the bravest human strength collapses.
