This phrase indicates the urgency and importance of the message being delivered. The use of messengers is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a> when Jacob sends messengers to Esau. The act of sending a messenger underscores the hierarchical structure of command and the reliance on human intermediaries to convey critical information.<p><b>and reported to David</b><br>David, the king of Israel, is the central figure in this narrative. His role as king is significant, as he is responsible for the military and political decisions of the nation. This moment is pivotal in the story of David's moral failure with Bathsheba and the subsequent cover-up involving her husband, Uriah. The report to David is a turning point that sets the stage for the unfolding of events that lead to David's confrontation by the prophet Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>.<p><b>all that Joab had sent him to say</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, is a key figure in this narrative. His loyalty to David is evident, but his actions also reflect the complexities of military leadership and the moral compromises often involved. Joab's instructions to the messenger are part of a larger strategy to conceal the circumstances of Uriah's death, highlighting themes of deception and the abuse of power. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of accountability, as seen in the eventual divine judgment pronounced by Nathan the prophet.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is at the center of this account.

This small transitional word anchors the verse in the flow of the narrative that started when David stayed behind in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>) and culminated in Uriah&#8217;s needless death (vv. 14-17).<p>&#8226; Because Joab has just instructed the courier on exactly how to frame the news (vv. 19-21), &#8220;So&#8221; signals the immediate obedience that follows the general&#8217;s orders&#8212;much like <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, where &#8220;So Abraham rose early&#8221; reveals prompt compliance.<p>&#8226; The word also reminds us that none of these events are random; God&#8217;s sovereign storyline is always moving forward (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the messenger</b><p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights messengers as indispensable links between commanders and kings (<a href="/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19-21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithful couriers echo the role God assigns to believers: &#8220;we are ambassadors for Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This unnamed envoy stands in contrast to David, who at this point is concealing sin; the messenger&#8217;s transparency exposes David&#8217;s secrecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>set out</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores urgency. Like Abram who &#8220;departed as the LORD had instructed him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), the courier wastes no time.<p>&#8226; Obedience is evidenced by motion; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reminds us that faith without accompanying action is dead.<p>&#8226; The journey from the battlefield to Jerusalem also creates a narrative pause, intensifying the moral tension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reported</b><p>&#8226; God values truthful reporting (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>; <a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>). The verse shows that the chain of communication is intact even if the motives behind it are questionable.<p>&#8226; Faithful disclosure models the believer&#8217;s duty to &#8220;speak the truth in love&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The messenger does not edit Joab&#8217;s words; he lets the facts stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to David</b><p>&#8226; Authority matters. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> teaches that &#8220;there is no authority except from God,&#8221; and here the military courier recognizes David as the God-appointed king&#8212;even while David is walking in sin.<p>&#8226; Bringing hard news to leaders is a biblical pattern (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>; <a href="/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a>). It exposes whether those leaders will respond in humility or pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all that</b><p>&#8226; Completeness is a virtue. Paul told the Ephesian elders, &#8220;I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Partial truth often betrays; full truth liberates. The messenger&#8217;s thoroughness stands in silent rebuke to David&#8217;s partial disclosures about Bathsheba and Uriah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joab had sent him</b><p>&#8226; Delegated authority is at work (<a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>). Joab&#8217;s command shapes the courier&#8217;s mission just as the Father sent the Son (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Joab is complicit in David&#8217;s scheme, yet even compromised leaders can deliver accurate information&#8212;a sobering reminder that right data do not always indicate right hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to say</b><p>&#8226; The message is verbal, underscoring the power of words (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a> records God&#8217;s insistence: &#8220;You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.&#8221; Likewise, the courier&#8217;s duty is to verbalize exactly what was entrusted to him.<p>&#8226; Believers today carry a gospel that must be spoken, not merely lived (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a> captures a moment of simple obedience inside a complex web of sin. A nameless messenger faithfully travels, submits to authority, and delivers an unfiltered report. His integrity contrasts starkly with David&#8217;s concealment, reminding us that while human leaders may fail, God&#8217;s unfolding plan&#8212;and the call for His people to speak truth&#8212;never wavers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the messenger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
