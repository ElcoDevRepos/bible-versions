Hebron, located in the territory of Judah, was David's initial capital and the place where he was anointed king over Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). The move to Jerusalem signifies the unification of the tribes of Israel under David's rule, as Jerusalem was a neutral city not previously controlled by any single tribe. This strategic relocation also fulfilled the need for a central capital that could unite the northern and southern tribes.<p><b>David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem</b><br>The practice of taking multiple wives and concubines was common among ancient Near Eastern kings, often used to form political alliances and demonstrate wealth and power. However, this practice was contrary to the ideal set forth in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, which warned against kings multiplying wives. David's actions here foreshadow future familial and political troubles, as seen in the strife among his children. This also contrasts with the monogamous ideal seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.<p><b>and more sons and daughters were born to him</b><br>The birth of more children to David in Jerusalem highlights the expansion of his family and the establishment of his dynasty. This growth in his household is significant for the Davidic covenant, where God promises to establish David's throne forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The numerous offspring also set the stage for future narratives involving David's children, such as the rebellion of Absalom and the succession of Solomon. The mention of sons and daughters emphasizes the continuation of David's lineage, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, as noted in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God, yet also for his human failings.

David certainly came perilously near a violation of this law, although he did not, like his son Solomon, take wives and concubines in enormous number for the sake of having a great harem--an important element in the Oriental ideas of regal magnificence. Any possible ambiguity in the phrase "<span class= "ital">out of </span>Jerusalem" is removed by the expression in the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-3.htm" title="And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.">1Chronicles 14:3</a>), "<span class= "ital">at </span>Jerusalem." Altogether, here and in Chronicles, the names of nineteen sons are mentioned; those of the daughters are not given, although one, Thamar, is mentioned in the story in 2 Samuel 13.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took him more concubines.</span> Thus with increase of power came also the increased gratification of David's weakness and sin. Well for him would it have been if, like Saul, he had been content with one wife. But this enlargement of his harem was gradual, and the list includes all the sons born at Jerusalem. Of these four, namely, Shammuah, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. were his children by Bathsheba (see <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, where the names are differently spelt). Besides a variation in the spelling, two sons are mentioned in Chronicles, Nogah and an earlier Eliphelet, whose names are not given here, perhaps because they died young. From <a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm">1 Chronicles 3:9</a> we learn that only the names of the sons of wives are given in these tables. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had arrived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
