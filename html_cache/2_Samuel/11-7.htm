His presence in David's court highlights the integration of non-Israelites into Israelite society, reflecting the diverse composition of David's army. Uriah's loyalty and integrity contrast sharply with David's actions in this narrative. This meeting sets the stage for David's attempt to cover up his sin with Bathsheba, Uriah's wife.<p><b>David asked how Joab and the troops were doing</b><br>Joab, David's nephew, was the commander of the army. His leadership in battle was crucial for David's military campaigns. The inquiry about Joab and the troops serves as a pretext for David's true intentions, which were to manipulate Uriah. This reflects the political and military concerns of a king, but also David's personal moral failings. The mention of Joab connects to his later role in David's life, including his involvement in Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>and how the war was going</b><br>The war in question was against the Ammonites, a recurring enemy of Israel. This conflict is part of the broader narrative of Israel's territorial expansion and consolidation under David's rule. The war's progress was significant for the security and prosperity of Israel. However, David's absence from the battlefield, as noted earlier in the chapter, marks a turning point in his reign, leading to personal and national consequences. This phrase underscores the tension between David's kingly duties and his personal failings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is central to this account.

These precedents remind us that royal summons were taken seriously, underscoring Uriah&#8217;s integrity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David asked how Joab</b><p>- David&#8217;s first inquiry targets Joab, his commander: &#8220;David asked how Joab &#8230; was doing&#8221; (11:7b).<p>- On the surface this sounds like normal leadership oversight, echoing David&#8217;s earlier partnership with Joab in successful campaigns (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; 10:7&#8211;14).<p>- Yet in light of David&#8217;s hidden sin (11:2&#8211;5) the question reeks of calculated courtesy. He masks sinful motives behind what looks like shepherd-king concern&#8212;an approach reminiscent of Saul&#8217;s hollow words to Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13</a>.<p>- The verse quietly contrasts Joab&#8217;s steadfast presence on the battlefield with David&#8217;s self-seeking absence, sharpening the moral tension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the troops were doing</b><p>- Next, David turns to &#8220;the troops&#8221; (11:7c). A good king should care for the welfare of his soldiers (compare <a href="/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-13.htm">1 Chronicles 19:13</a>).<p>- David&#8217;s words ring hollow because he has already endangered these very men by keeping Bathsheba&#8217;s husband from the lines. His concern is selective, aimed at covering his tracks rather than truly protecting his warriors.<p>- The passage foreshadows how far David will go&#8212;manipulating battlefield orders in 11:15&#8212;to preserve his image. <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a> speaks to this impulse: &#8220;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper&#8230;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and how the war was going</b><p>- Finally, David asks &#8220;how the war was going&#8221; (11:7d). The king who once trusted the LORD for victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>) now leverages a war report as a pretext to bring Uriah home.<p>- The contrast with <a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a> is stark: &#8220;But David remained in Jerusalem.&#8221; The king absents himself from God-given duty, then uses that same war to cloak adultery and impending murder (11:15&#8211;17).<p>- Other narratives show faithful leaders seeking real battle updates&#8212;e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24&#8211;28</a> (David awaiting news of Absalom&#8217;s revolt). Here, David&#8217;s counterfeit interest exposes a heart drifting from wholehearted obedience (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/11-7.htm">2 Samuel 11:7</a> pictures a king staging a pastoral interview to hide personal sin. Uriah&#8217;s quick compliance highlights his loyalty, while David&#8217;s polite questions about Joab, the troops, and the war serve as a smokescreen. The verse reminds us how easily outward concern can camouflage inward compromise, calling every believer to transparent obedience before the God who sees all (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Uriah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#363;&#183;r&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_223.htm">Strong's 223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Uriah -- 'flame of Yah', the name of a Hittite and of two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
