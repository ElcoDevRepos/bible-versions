His position as commander of the entire army of Israel highlights his significant influence and authority. Joab's leadership is marked by both loyalty and ruthlessness, as seen in his actions throughout 2 Samuel. His role is crucial in maintaining the stability of David's kingdom, especially during times of internal strife and rebellion. Joab's military prowess is evident in his successful campaigns and strategic acumen. His complex character is further explored in his interactions with David, Absalom, and other key figures, reflecting the challenges of leadership in a turbulent period of Israel's history.<p><b>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;</b><br>Benaiah, a valiant warrior and loyal supporter of David, is noted for his bravery and leadership. As the son of Jehoiada, he comes from a priestly lineage, which may have contributed to his sense of duty and honor. Benaiah's command over the Cherethites and Pelethites, who served as David's personal bodyguards, underscores his trusted position within the king's inner circle. These groups, possibly of foreign origin, were elite troops known for their loyalty and effectiveness. Benaiah's later role as commander of the army under Solomon further attests to his enduring legacy and the respect he garnered throughout his life.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s provision of ordered authority, the value of faithful service, and the anticipation of a flawless, future King who will rule with perfect justice and protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Josh,</span> etc. With this list of his chief officers, the narrator closes the history of David's reign; for the remaining four chapters form a kind of appendix. A similar list closes ch. 8, where, too, there is a break in the history, the previous narra-tire having been a summary of the rapid rise of David's empire. In this section, ch. 9-20, we have a more full and detailed account of David's wars, leading on to his crime and its punishment. The rest of David's life we may trust was calm and uneventful, but it was the life of a sorrow stricken man; and the sword again woke up against his family when his end was approaching, and filled his dying hours with grief and trouble. This list is much later in date than that previously given, though most of the officers are the same. Cherethites. This is a correction of the Massorites to make the passage agree with <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. The K'tib has <span class="accented">cari</span>, a word which occurs in <a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>, where in the Authorized Version it is translated "captains," but in the Revised Version <span class="accented">Carites</span>, which here appears only in the margin. But there is no reason why the place of the Cherethites should not have been taken by Carian mercenaries later on in David's reign, though really we know too little about such matters to be able to form a judgment. Some commentators translate <span class="accented">cari</span> "digger," and suppose that it means executioner; but why a digger should have such a meaning is inexplicable. It may be interesting to add that the Caftans were famous in old times as mercenaries. During the reign of Manasseh, Psammetichus won the throne of all Egypt by the aid of Caftans, and from that period they took a leading part in all Egyptian wars. The age of David is much more antique, but as there was constant communication between Phoenicia and Asia Minor and Greece, there is nothing improbable in David taking Caftans into his service in place of the Philistine Cherethites. His connection with them would soon cease after he left Ziklag. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1429;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
