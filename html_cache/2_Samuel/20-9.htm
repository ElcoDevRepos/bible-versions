Joab's use of "my brother" indicates a sense of kinship or camaraderie, though it is likely insincere given the context. In the ancient Near East, such greetings were common and often served as a prelude to more serious discussions or actions. The use of familial language can be seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/29-4.htm">Genesis 29:4</a>, where Jacob addresses shepherds as "my brothers." This greeting sets the stage for Joab's deceptive intentions, reminiscent of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus with a kiss in <a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>.<p><b>And with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him.</b><br>Grabbing the beard was a gesture that could signify respect or affection, as beards were considered symbols of manhood and dignity in ancient Israelite culture. However, Joab's action is a prelude to treachery, as he uses this gesture to draw Amasa close under the guise of friendship. The right hand is often associated with power and authority in biblical texts, as seen in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at God's right hand. Joab's use of his right hand here underscores the betrayal, as he exploits a position of strength to commit murder. This act of deception parallels other biblical accounts of betrayal, such as Absalom's deceitful behavior in <a href="/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5-6</a>, and foreshadows the ultimate betrayal of Christ by Judas.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and political cunning.

David is working to consolidate his kingdom, and Joab sees Amasa as a threat to his position.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deception.htm">The Deception</a></b><br>Joab's act of taking Amasa by the beard to kiss him is a cultural gesture of greeting and respect, which he uses deceitfully to lower Amasa's guard.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deception.htm">The Danger of Deception</a></b><br>Joab's actions remind us of the destructive power of deceit.
