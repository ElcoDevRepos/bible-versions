After Saul's death, his household would have been in a precarious position, as the transition of power to David, who was from a different tribe, could have led to the elimination of Saul's family and associates. Ziba's role as a servant indicates he was likely responsible for managing the affairs of Saul's estate. This context highlights the political and social dynamics of the time, where loyalty to a former king could be dangerous. The mention of Ziba by name suggests his importance in the narrative, as he becomes a key figure in the story of Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson.<p><b>They summoned him to David,</b><br>David's summoning of Ziba indicates his intention to show kindness to the house of Saul, fulfilling his covenant with Jonathan, Saul's son, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>. This act of summoning also reflects the authority David held as king, able to call individuals to his presence. It demonstrates David's desire to maintain justice and mercy, key themes in his reign. The summoning of Ziba sets the stage for the unfolding of David's grace towards Mephibosheth, which is a reflection of God's grace towards humanity.<p><b>and the king inquired, &#8220;Are you Ziba?&#8221;</b><br>David's inquiry shows his personal involvement and attention to detail in matters of state and personal promises. It reflects the importance of identity and recognition in the ancient Near Eastern culture, where knowing someone's name and status was crucial for social and political interactions. This question also serves to confirm Ziba's identity, ensuring that David is speaking to the correct person who can provide information about Saul's descendants.<p><b>&#8220;I am your servant,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Ziba's response indicates his acknowledgment of David's authority and his willingness to serve the new king. This phrase reflects the cultural norms of the time, where servants were expected to show loyalty and submission to their masters. Ziba's declaration of servitude is significant, as it sets the tone for his future actions and interactions with David and Mephibosheth. It also highlights the theme of servanthood, which is prevalent throughout the Bible and is exemplified in the life of Jesus Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God and his covenant with Jonathan, Saul's son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>A servant from the house of Saul, who plays a crucial role in connecting David to Mephibosheth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_saul.htm">House of Saul</a></b><br>The former royal family of Israel, now largely fallen from power after Saul's death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, he is the son of Jonathan and the grandson of Saul, whom David seeks to show kindness to for Jonathan's sake.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns as king and where this event takes place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>David's inquiry about the house of Saul demonstrates his commitment to the covenant he made with Jonathan.

This echoes David&#8217;s earlier resolve: &#8220;Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan&#8217;s sake?&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s summons underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;David is actively seeking opportunities to keep covenant, just as the Lord seeks and saves (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It also bridges the long conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>), signaling a move from rivalry to mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the king inquired, &#8220;Are you Ziba?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David personally verifies Ziba&#8217;s identity, showing that covenant kindness is directed, deliberate, and grounded in truth (compare <a href="/1_samuel/17-58.htm">1 Samuel 17:58</a>, where Saul confirms David&#8217;s lineage).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s question models responsible stewardship&#8212;he will bless the rightful individual, not an imposter (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3&#8211;4</a>, where the shepherd calls his own sheep by name).<p>&#8226; This careful inquiry highlights David&#8217;s justice as well as his mercy, reflecting the balanced character God desires in leaders (<a href="/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am your servant,&#8221; he replied</b><p>&#8226; Ziba&#8217;s response is immediate: &#8220;I am your servant.&#8221; Such words acknowledge David&#8217;s God-given authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His declaration of servanthood mirrors Mephibosheth&#8217;s later humility (<a href="/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>) and foreshadows the ultimate Servant-King, Jesus, who &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also reveals how God can reposition people from the previous regime into rightful submission under His chosen king, demonstrating His sovereign power to reorder allegiances (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/9-2.htm">2 Samuel 9:2</a> literally records a moment of covenant kindness in motion.

The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s preservation of individuals like Ziba for His purposes.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s faithfulness to covenant promises.<p>&#8226; The rightful submission owed to God-appointed authority.<p>In a single sentence, Scripture opens the door for the grace that will soon be extended to Mephibosheth, illustrating that the Lord delights to honor His word through tangible acts of mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A servant whose name was Ziba.</span> It is evident from this that David was not certain that Jonathan had left behind him a son; but not because of the change of name from Meribbaal (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>); for <span class="accented">Baal</span> retained its innocent meaning of "lord" until the time of Jezebel. It then became the title of the Phoenician sun god; and Jezebel's shameless worship of this deity, and her cruelty to Jehovah's prophets, made the people henceforth change the name Baal into Bosheth, "the shameful thing" (see note on 2 Samuel 2:8). Mephibosheth had not changed his name, but had lived in obscurity in the wild region beyond Mahanaim. Meanwhile Ziba had probably taken care of Saul's property in the tribe of Benjamin. There is no reason to doubt that he had been steward there for Saul, and after his master's death had continued in possession of the estate. David, we may feel sure, would not interfere with it, and Ziba would hold it for Saul's heirs, who could not themselves take possession. To him David now sends, not because he expected to hear of a son of his dear friend Jonathan, but because he was ready to show kindness to any representative of the fallen monarch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And there was a servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1433;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Saul&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">family</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
