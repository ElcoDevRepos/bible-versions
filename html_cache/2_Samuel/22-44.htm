Historically, David faced significant strife from his own people, including Saul's pursuit and the rebellion of his son Absalom. The term "strife" indicates not just physical battles but also political and familial discord. This deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced rejection and conflict from His own people, yet was ultimately victorious. The deliverance signifies God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to David, paralleling the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<p><b>You have preserved me as the head of nations;</b><br>David's role as "head of nations" points to his leadership and influence beyond Israel. After consolidating his kingdom, David extended his rule over surrounding nations, such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Edomites. This preservation as a leader is a testament to God's covenant with David, promising him a lasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). It also foreshadows the messianic reign of Christ, who is the ultimate "head of nations," ruling with justice and righteousness. The phrase underscores the theme of divine preservation and the establishment of God's chosen leaders.<p><b>a people I had not known shall serve me.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the expansion of David's influence to foreign nations, which he had not previously encountered. It signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to make David's name great and his kingdom expansive. This can be seen as a prophetic glimpse of the inclusion of Gentiles into the kingdom of God, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel to all nations. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's plan for all peoples to come under His sovereign rule, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Christ, who draws all nations to Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance and faithfulness throughout his life, particularly in his role as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David was anointed king, often facing internal strife and external threats.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding peoples and kingdoms that David subdued or influenced during his reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in David's song, acknowledged as the source of deliverance and strength.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/strife_of_my_people.htm">Strife of My People</a></b><br>Refers to the internal conflicts and challenges David faced within Israel, including opposition from Saul and later from his own son, Absalom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Recognize that God is our deliverer in times of internal and external conflict.

Each could have shattered Israel from within, yet God &#8220;delivered&#8221; him every time.<p>&#8226; The verse is echoed in <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>, underscoring its importance in David&#8217;s personal worship.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve unity among His chosen people is a recurring theme: see <a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1&#8211;15</a>, where Moses is vindicated against Miriam and Aaron; and <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1&#8211;7</a>, where early church strife is solved by divine wisdom.<p>&#8226; The deliverance is literal&#8212;real battles, flesh-and-blood threats&#8212;showing that God intervenes in tangible circumstances, not merely psychological ones.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have preserved me as the head of nations</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;You have preserved me as the head of nations&#8221;<p>&#8226; Once internal strife was subdued, external prominence followed. <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> records David subduing Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Arameans, and others, placing garrisons and collecting tribute.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD will make you the head and not the tail&#8221;&#8212;finds a specific fulfillment in David&#8217;s reign.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;preserved me&#8221; implies ongoing protection, not just a one-time promotion. God fortified David&#8217;s throne despite constant foreign threats (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The heading role foreshadows Messiah&#8217;s universal kingship (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>) and affirms God&#8217;s pattern: He exalts His chosen leader for the blessing of many nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a people I had not known shall serve me</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;A people I had not known shall serve me&#8221;<p>&#8226; David experienced voluntary submission from foreign peoples who previously had no covenant tie with him&#8212;Hiram of Tyre (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), Toi of Hamath (<a href="/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9-10</a>), and others.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a> notes, &#8220;The fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations&#8221;. The service offered was often tribute, alliance, or labor, but always under God&#8217;s overruling hand.<p>&#8226; This anticipates the gospel age when Gentiles, people &#8220;not known&#8221; in the Old Covenant sense, gladly serve the Son of David (<a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>; <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s testimony assures believers that God can bring unexpected allies and open doors outside familiar circles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God personally rescued David from internal discord, elevated him to international leadership, and drew unfamiliar peoples into willing service. The verse captures a progression: peace within, authority without, influence beyond. It showcases the Lord&#8217;s power to deliver, preserve, and expand His servant&#8217;s reach, pointing ultimately to the reigning Christ who unites, governs, and gathers all nations to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-46.</span> - <p><span class="accented">"And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my people;<br />Thou hast protected me that I might be head of the nations.<br />A people whom! knew not have become my servants;<br />Children of strangers have submitted themselves to me;<br />At the hearing of the ear they obeyed me.<br />The children of the strangers faded away;<br />They fled trembling out of their fastnesses."</span> <span class="cmt_word">People</span>, in the singular, means the Jewish people as opposed to the nations, that is, the heathen world. <span class="cmt_word">The strivings</span> here referred to are the long dissensions which followed Ishbosheth's death, and delayed for many the appointment of David as king of Israel. He now feels that the watchful which had protected him during that dangerous period had a higher purpose than the union of the twelve tribes under one head. He was to be the founder also of that empire over the nations which symbolized the gift of the heathen world to Christ. And this empire had been extended to people previously unknown to David. Such might be the case with Hadarezer, King of Zobah, but it more especially referred to Toi, and the Hittite kingdom of Hamath (<a href="/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>). It was not from force of arms, but from the hearing of the ear, that is, from the wide extended fame of David's conquests, that Toi sent ambassadors to offer allegiance and presents. <span class="cmt_word">They fled trembling.</span> This is certainly the sense in <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>, where, however, there is a transposition of letters. Probably it is the sense here. But if we might go to the cognate languages for an explanation of a rare word, it would mean "came limping out of their fastnesses," as men worn out with fatigue and exhaustion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have delivered me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1496;&#1461;&#1428;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;p&#772;al&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
