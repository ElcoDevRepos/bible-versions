The pursuit of enemies signifies a relentless and determined effort to defeat those who opposed Israel. This mirrors the divine mandate given to Israel to conquer the Promised Land and eliminate idolatrous influences. Theologically, it can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual warfare believers face, where they are called to pursue and overcome sin and evil through the power of God. The destruction of enemies also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</a>, where Christ is said to reign until all His enemies are under His feet.<p><b>I did not turn back until they were consumed.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes David's perseverance and complete victory over his adversaries. It highlights the thoroughness of his campaigns, ensuring that the threat was entirely eliminated. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of total warfare, where victory was not just about winning battles but ensuring the enemy could not rise again. Spiritually, it can be seen as an encouragement for believers to persist in their faith and not retreat in the face of spiritual battles. The concept of not turning back is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to press on toward the goal (<a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>) and to stand firm in the faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>). This perseverance is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who did not turn back from His mission to redeem humanity, culminating in His declaration on the cross, "It is finished" (<a

Mean</div><b>I pursued my enemies</b><p>&#8211; David&#8217;s language is active, intentional, and personal. The king does not wait for opposition to fade; he goes after it.<p>&#8211; Cross references reinforce this God&#8211;given boldness: <a href="/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a> &#8220;pursue your enemies and attack them from the rear,&#8221; and <a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a> where David &#8220;ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The pursuit rests on God&#8217;s promise of victory (<a href="/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>), not on self-reliance. David&#8217;s confidence flows from knowing the LORD &#8220;trains my hands for battle&#8221; (v. 35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and destroyed them</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Destroyed&#8221; signals decisive triumph, not a partial win. The phrase echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>, &#8220;the LORD your God&#8230; to give you victory.&#8221;<p>&#8211; David is describing military success granted by God, yet it foreshadows spiritual warfare for believers today (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>). We fight with truth, righteousness, and faith until evil strongholds fall.<p>&#8211; Modern application: persistent obedience&#8212;under God&#8217;s authority&#8212;breaks chains of sin and falsehood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I did not turn back</b><p>&#8211; Perseverance marks true faith. David refuses to retreat mid-battle, mirroring <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a> &#8220;Do not turn from it to the right or to the left.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The king&#8217;s endurance models <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm">Hebrews 10:39</a>, &#8220;we are not of those who shrink back.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Practical take-away: finish what God assigns&#8212;parenting, ministry, repentance&#8212;without quitting when resistance intensifies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until they were consumed</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Consumed&#8221; communicates completion; there is nothing left of the threat. <a href="/psalms/18-37.htm">Psalm 18:37-38</a> (the parallel song) repeats the line, underscoring totality.<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s justice is thorough: evil cannot coexist indefinitely with His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20-21</a>).<p>&#8211; For the believer, Christ&#8217;s victory at the cross has already &#8220;disarmed the powers and authorities&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). We live out that finished work while awaiting its visible culmination.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David testifies that, by God&#8217;s empowering, he chased, struck down, persevered, and eradicated his foes. The verse illustrates courageous pursuit, decisive action, unwavering endurance, and complete victory&#8212;all grounded in the LORD&#8217;s faithfulness. It invites us to trust the same God for strength to confront sin and opposition until His triumph is fully displayed in our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Destroyed them.</span>--In the psalm, "overtaken them," an expression intended to suggest the same thing as the plain expression here. The second clauses are identical in the original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-40.</span> - <p><span class="accented">"I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them;<br />Neither did I turn again until I had consumed them.<br />And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, and they arose not;<br />Yea, they fell under my feet.<br />For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;<br />Thou hast made them that rose against me to bow under me."</span> In the Psalms, for <span class="cmt_word">destroyed</span> we find "overtaken," and the second "I have consumed them" is omitted. This exultation of David at the result of his wars is in accordance with the harsh treatment inflicted by him upon the vanquished. His enemies were God's enemies, whom he must consume. The "new commandment" of Christianity forbids and condemns this delight in conquest. Vers. 41-43. - <p><span class="accented">"And mine enemies thou hast made to turn upon me their back,<br />Even those that hate me; and have utterly destroyed them.<br />They looked, but there was none to save,<br />Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.<br />And I beat them small as the dust of the earth;<br />As the mire of the streets I stamped upon them, I trode them down."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Those that hate me.</span> The sentence is to be completed from the previous clause, "my haters" and "my enemies" being equivalent. There are several small variations between the text here and in <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, such as "they cried" for they looked; and "I emptied them out" for I stamped upon them, the difference in both cases consisting in a single letter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I pursued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;er&#183;d&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7291.htm">Strong's 7291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pursue, chase, persecute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my enemies</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7687;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124;
