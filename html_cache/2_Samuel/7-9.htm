It reflects the covenant relationship between God and David, similar to God's promise to be with the patriarchs like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>). This divine accompaniment signifies God's favor and protection, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of Jesus' presence with His followers (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>and I have cut off all your enemies from before you</b><br>This statement highlights God's active role in securing victories for David against his adversaries. Historically, David faced numerous enemies, including the Philistines, Amalekites, and internal threats like Saul. God's intervention in these battles underscores His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. This divine protection and victory are reminiscent of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt and their enemies in the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a>).<p><b>Now I will make for you a name like that of the greatest in the land</b><br>Here, God promises to elevate David's reputation and legacy, aligning with His covenant to establish David's dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This promise is not only about personal fame but also about establishing a lasting kingdom, which finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The phrase connects to God's promise to Abraham to make his name great (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>) and points to the eternal kingdom of Christ, who is the greatest in the land and beyond (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God for his heart and leadership.

The same God who was &#8220;with Joseph&#8221; in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2, 21</a>) and who promised Joshua, &#8220;I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>) has consistently accompanied David from shepherd fields to royal throne.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence is not abstract; it is active. When Saul pursued David, &#8220;the LORD was with David&#8221; and &#8220;protected him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14, 28</a>). David&#8217;s triumphs over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>) and in countless battles (<a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>) were expressions of the covenant promise that God would personally shepherd His servant.<p>&#8226; For believers today, Jesus echoes the same assurance: &#8220;I am with you always, to the very end of the age&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The permanence of divine companionship anchors faith in every circumstance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I have cut off all your enemies from before you</b><p>&#8226; The Lord alone dismantled David&#8217;s opposition. From defeating Philistine giants (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18-25</a>) to silencing internal foes like Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>), God decisively cleared the path.<p>&#8226; This mirrors earlier covenant language: &#8220;The LORD your God will drive out those nations before you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>). David&#8217;s story proves God&#8217;s track record of fighting for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights both protection and judgment. Enemies were &#8220;cut off&#8221; because they opposed the Lord&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-6</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness includes safeguarding His redemptive plan, ultimately fulfilled in the greater Son of David, Christ (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-71</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now I will make for you a name like that of the greatest in the land</b><p>&#8226; Having reaffirmed past grace, God unveils future grace: a promise of enduring renown. This is more than personal fame; it anticipates an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The pledge parallels God&#8217;s word to Abraham, &#8220;I will make your name great&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). David stands in that covenant line, showing continuity in God&#8217;s redemptive agenda.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s &#8220;great name&#8221; ultimately blossoms in the Messiah. Jesus is hailed as &#8220;the root and the offspring of David&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>), and every knee will bow to Him (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). God&#8217;s commitment to glorify His servant&#8217;s name finds its fullest expression in the exaltation of Christ, bringing eternal honor to David&#8217;s house and universal blessing to all who believe (<a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a> traces a gracious timeline: past presence, past victories, and future honor. The Lord personally guided David, defeated his enemies, and now pledges an enduring legacy that culminates in the Messiah. The verse showcases God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness&#8212;He stays, He fights, He exalts&#8212;inviting every believer to trust His unchanging promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thee a great name.</span> The widespread conquests of David, and his great empire, were not for the sake of mere earthly dominion. It was, first of all, a type of Messiah's reign, to whom God has premised the heathen for his inheritance, and that his gospel shall be carried to the ends of the earth. But, secondly, if Messiah was to be "David's Son," it was necessary that that king should hold a special place in the hearts of all Israelites. In the fables and tales of the Arabs, it is Solomon who holds the foremost place. Just as our forefathers showed the native qualities of the race by making Arthur's court the abode of prowess and chivalrous bravery; so the Arabs made Solomon's court the representative of that dazzling splendor and magnificence which they so admired; and invested him with superhuman knowledge and magical power, such as made janns and ifreets the humble slaves of his will. In the Old Testament no king is "Jehovah's servant" but David; no king is ever connected with Messiah but David. The religious fervent of the people may gather round a Hezekiah or a Josiah, and prophets may encourage them in their work; but no prophet sees in either of them the ancestor of Christ. It is, however, in the Psalms that we learn the full meaning of Nathan's words. Here a veil is partly drawn over them. But it would be a wilful closing of the eyes to read this message and not bear in mind the clear light with which every word is illumined by the inspired outpouring of David's own heart. He thoroughly understood the fulness and blessedness of God's revelation, and has taught us that it all looked onward to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have been</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eh&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
