It symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel. The Levites were designated to carry the Ark, emphasizing the holiness and reverence required in handling it. This event follows the earlier incident where Uzzah was struck dead for touching the Ark, highlighting the need for obedience to God's instructions (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>had advanced six paces</b><br>The number six may symbolize incompleteness or human effort, as it falls short of the divine number seven, which represents completion and perfection. The careful advancement of only six steps before stopping suggests a deliberate act of reverence and caution, acknowledging the holiness of the Ark and the presence of God. This act contrasts with the previous attempt to transport the Ark on a cart, which was not in accordance with God's instructions (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13-15</a>).<p><b>he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement, thanksgiving, and dedication to God. The ox and fattened calf represent significant offerings, indicating the importance of the occasion. Sacrifices were a way to honor God and seek His favor, and in this context, they underscore the joy and reverence of bringing the Ark to Jerusalem. This act of sacrifice can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is leading the procession to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

The work was begun and ended with solemn sacrifice. It is quite unnecessary to suppose that offerings were made at each six steps of the way, for although this might have been possible, it is not recorded. Of course, David offered these sacrifices, like all Israel" in <a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm" title="And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.">1Kings 8:62</a>, through the ministration of the priests whom he had called together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six, paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">an ox and a fatling.</span> Many suppose that David sacrificed an ox and a fatling every six paces along the whole way from the house of Obed-Edom, which was probably near or even in Jerusalem, unto the tent prepared for the ark in Zion. "Evidently the way to the holy city was a way of blood. The stained streets of Zion, the rivers of blood, the slaughtered heaps and the blaze of altar fires formed a strange contrast to the dancing, the singing, and the harping of the multitudes who crowded the city" (Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 288). It is not necessary to suppose, with some objectors, that the ark waited till each sacrifice was completed, or that the road thus lined with victims was many miles in length. The ark did not remain at Perez-Uzzah, but was carried in silent awe to the house of a Levite; and such a house probably was not to be found until they were inside the city walls. There were no country houses in a region lately twice ravaged by the Philistines. But there is an objection to this view, namely, that it is not the sense of the Hebrew. What is there said is that at starting, after stepping six paces, David sacrificed an ox and a fatling (by the hands, of course, of the priests), to ask a blessing upon the removal of the ark, and avert all misfortune. In Chronicles we read nothing of this, but of a sacrifice of seven bullocks and seven rams, offered by the Levites. The one was David's offering made at the beginning, to consecrate the removal; the other was made at the end, and was a thank offering of the Levites, because they had carried the ark safely (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a>). The Vulgate has a remarkable addition to ver. 12, taken doubtless by Jerome from manuscripts which existed in his day. It is as follows: "There were with David seven choruses and a calf as victim." The fact is not in itself improbable, and means that the musicians and dancers were divided into bands which mutually relieved one another. And as a sacrifice was also a feast, each band had a calf provided for it.
