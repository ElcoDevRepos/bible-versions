The act of grabbing the opponent by the head signifies close-quarters combat, which was common in battles of this era. This encounter is part of a larger conflict between the forces of David and Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, highlighting the division within Israel after Saul's death. The personal nature of this combat can be seen as a microcosm of the larger civil strife within the nation.<p><b>and thrust his sword into his opponent&#8217;s side</b><br>The use of swords in this context underscores the lethal and decisive nature of the encounter. Swords were a primary weapon in ancient Israelite warfare, often signifying power and authority. This act of mutual destruction reflects the futility and tragedy of civil war, where brother fights against brother. The imagery of the sword piercing the side can also evoke the later crucifixion of Jesus Christ, where His side was pierced, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice and the end of enmity.<p><b>and they all fell together</b><br>This phrase indicates the simultaneous death of the combatants, emphasizing the senseless loss of life in internal conflict. The collective fall of these men serves as a somber reminder of the cost of division and strife within God's chosen people. It also foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David, as the futility of such conflicts becomes apparent.<p><b>So this place, which is in Gibeon, is called Helkath-hazzurim</b><br>Gibeon was a significant city in the tribal territory of Benjamin, known for its strategic importance. The naming of the place as Helkath-hazzurim, meaning "Field of Swords" or "Field of Strong Men," memorializes the tragic event. This location becomes a testament to the destructive power of internal conflict and serves as a historical marker for future generations. The naming of places after significant events is a common biblical motif, often serving as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the consequences of human actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>- The commander of David's forces, representing the tribe of Judah and David's interests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>- The commander of Saul's army, representing the northern tribes of Israel and the house of Saul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>- A significant city in the territory of Benjamin, serving as the setting for this confrontation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/helkath-hazzurim.htm">Helkath-hazzurim</a></b><br>- The name given to the field where the battle took place, meaning "Field of Swords" or "Field of Strong Men."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_duel.htm">The Duel</a></b><br>- A deadly contest between twelve men from each side, representing the larger conflict between the house of David and the house of Saul.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_violence.htm">The Futility of Violence</a></b><br>The mutual destruction in this passage underscores the tragic consequences of violence and the cycle of retribution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Leaders like Joab and Abner bear responsibility for the actions and outcomes of their followers, reminding us of the weight of leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_division.htm">The Cost of Division</a></b><br>The conflict between the houses of David and Saul illustrates the destructive nature of division within God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_conflict.htm">God's Sovereignty in Conflict</a></b><br>Despite human conflict, God's purposes prevail, as seen in the eventual unification of Israel under David.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reconciliation.htm">The Importance of Reconciliation</a></b><br>This passage invites reflection on the need for reconciliation and peace-making efforts within communities and families.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_2_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_2_16_Brethren_conflict_nature.htm">What does 2 Samuel 2:16 reveal about the nature of conflict among brethren?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Apply_2_Samuel_2_16_to_modern_disputes.htm">How can we apply the lessons from 2 Samuel 2:16 to resolve disputes today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/What_does_this_teach_about_pride.htm">What does "each man grabbed his opponent" teach about human pride and rivalry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_2_16_vs_Jesus_on_peace.htm">How does 2 Samuel 2:16 connect to Jesus' teachings on peace and reconciliation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_foster_unity_in_our_church.htm">In what ways can we promote unity in our church, avoiding conflicts like 2 Samuel 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_2_Samuel_2_16_battle_important.htm">What is the significance of the battle described in 2 Samuel 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_2_16_s_link_to_Israel-Judah_war.htm">How does 2 Samuel 2:16 reflect the broader conflict between Israel and Judah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_head-grabbing_in_2_Sam_2_16.htm">What does the phrase "each man grabbed his opponent by the head" symbolize in 2 Samuel 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/any_historical_proof_for_2_samuel_16.htm">(2 Samuel 16) Are there any independent historical or archaeological records confirming these specific events and people mentioned in this chapter?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_2_samuel_2_12-16_historically_plausible.htm">In 2 Samuel 2:12&#8211;16, is the description of men killing each other simultaneously around the pool of Gibeon historically plausible or exaggerated? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_killed_saul__himself_or_amalekite.htm">Who killed Saul?

Most modern expositors understand it as meaning "the field of sharp edges."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His sword in his fellow's side.</span> The absence of the verb in the original sets powerfully before us the rapidity of the whole action. But what an action! Twenty-four experienced men each take the other by the head, and, without any attempt at self-defence, thrust their swords into their opponents' side, and leave their own sides exposed to a similar thrust. Were they, then, unskilful in the use of weapons? Impossible. Were they blinded by hatred of one another? But no rancour would make a man forget his skill in defence. Here there is no variety, no checkered fortune of the combatants, but all twenty-four do and suffer just the same; and it is remarkable that they had swords only, and no shields. With shields on their arms, they could not have seized one another by the hair. It seems certain, therefore, that this mutual butchery was the "play;" nor can we conceive of a more murderous and savage proceeding. Abner, at the head of his fierce Benjamites, thought, perhaps, that Joab had no men among his followers willing to throw life away in so senseless a manner. But Joab was as ready as Abner, and possibly some code of false honour, such as used to make men practise duelling, required the acceptance of the challenge. And so, with their appetite for blood whetted by the sight of twenty-four murders, they hastened to begin the fight. <span class="cmt_word">Helkath-hazzurim.</span> Literally this means "the field of flints;" but as the flint is constantly used for any hard rock (<a href="/psalms/78-20.htm">Psalm 78:20</a>), the Authorized Version has admitted into the margin a paraphrase taken from the Vulgate, which supposes that by flints are meant "strong men," and renders, "the field of strong men." So in <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a> "the flint," or rock, "of ages," is even translated "everlasting strength." Flints, however, were constantly used by the Israelites for knives whenever extreme sharpness was required. Thus for the circumcising of Israel, Jehovah commanded Joshua to prepare knives of flint (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>); and in course of time the sharp or whetted edge of a weapon was called its flint. Thus in <a href="/psalms/89-43.htm">Psalm 89:43</a> we read, "Thou hast turned back the flint of his sword." The name therefore probably means "the field of the sharp knives" (see margin of the Revised Version), and refers to the short swords with which they murdered one another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then each man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;
