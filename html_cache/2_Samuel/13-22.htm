In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family honor and reputation were paramount, and Absalom's silence may have been a way to avoid public scandal while he plotted his revenge. The lack of communication between Absalom and Amnon suggests a deep-seated animosity and a calculated restraint. This silence is reminiscent of other biblical instances where silence precedes significant action, such as Jesus before His accusers (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>).<p><b>because he hated Amnon</b><br>Hatred in biblical terms often leads to severe consequences, as seen in the stories of Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>) and Joseph and his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>). Absalom's hatred is rooted in a sense of justice and familial duty, as Amnon's actions brought disgrace upon their family. This hatred foreshadows the eventual violent outcome, aligning with the biblical principle that unchecked hatred can lead to sin (1 <a href="/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a>).<p><b>for violating his sister Tamar</b><br>The violation of Tamar is a pivotal event that sets off a chain reaction of familial discord and tragedy. In the historical and cultural context, Tamar's violation was not only a personal affront but also a severe breach of social and religious norms. The law of Moses explicitly condemned such acts (<a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-25.htm">Deuteronomy 22:25-27</a>), and the lack of immediate justice for Tamar reflects the complexities of royal family dynamics.

Like Joseph&#8217;s brothers who &#8220;could not speak peaceably to him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>), Absalom withholds speech to conceal his intentions.<p>- Proverbs warns that &#8220;He who conceals hatred has lying lips&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>). Absalom&#8217;s silence masks a simmering plan for revenge that will surface two years later (<a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23&#8211;29</a>).<p>- His wordless stance also echoes <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart&#8221;&#8212;revealing how outward quiet can hide inward hostility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>either good or bad</b><p>- The total absence of any comment (&#8220;good or bad&#8221;) underscores a posture of complete disengagement. Elijah challenged wavering Israel, &#8220;How long will you hesitate between two opinions?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>); Absalom chooses neither blessing nor confrontation.<p>- Jesus rebukes lukewarm neutrality (<a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15&#8211;16</a>), yet Absalom&#8217;s neutrality is not peaceable&#8212;it is strategic indifference that allows bitterness to harden.<p>- <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a> instructs, &#8220;Detest evil; cling to what is good.&#8221; Absalom clings to neither, creating a vacuum where resentment thrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he hated Amnon</b><p>- Hatred, if unaddressed, matures into murder (<a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>). Absalom nurses his grudge for two years, illustrating <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26&#8211;27</a>: &#8220;Do not let the sun set upon your anger, and do not give the devil a foothold.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a> commands, &#8220;You must not harbor hatred against your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor directly, so you will not incur guilt.&#8221; Absalom ignores this, choosing secrecy over confrontation.<p>- Jesus equates anger with killing in the heart (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21&#8211;22</a>), showing that Absalom&#8217;s hatred is already spiritual murder long before the physical act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for violating his sister Tamar</b><p>- The cause of Absalom&#8217;s hatred is clear: Amnon&#8217;s assault on Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1&#8211;14</a>). Mosaic Law treated such violation as a capital offense (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-25.htm">Deuteronomy 22:25&#8211;27</a>), so Absalom views Amnon&#8217;s crime as deserving death.<p>- David&#8217;s failure to bring justice (<a href="/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21</a>) fuels Absalom&#8217;s outrage. The earlier prophecy that &#8220;the sword will never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>) unfolds as familial sin begets further violence.<p>- Tamar remains desolate in Absalom&#8217;s house (<a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm">2 Samuel 13:20</a>), a living testimony that wrongs left unaddressed can fracture families for generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Absalom&#8217;s silence toward Amnon is not peace but premeditation. By withholding &#8220;any word, good or bad,&#8221; he cultivates concealed hatred, in direct contradiction to God&#8217;s call for open, righteous confrontation. Rooted in the unresolved violation of Tamar and David&#8217;s passive leadership, Absalom&#8217;s smoldering anger foreshadows bloodshed that will scar the kingdom. The verse warns that silence can be sin, neutrality can mask malice, and unchecked hatred will inevitably seek violent resolution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom spake...neither good nor bad.</span> (On this phrase, see <a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>.)
