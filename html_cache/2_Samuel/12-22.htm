This moment follows the death of his child, born from his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba. David's response is significant as it reflects his understanding of God's sovereignty and his own repentance. His answer is a window into his heart, showing a man who, despite his failures, seeks after God.<p><b>While the child was alive</b><br>This phrase indicates the period of intense intercession by David. The child, a result of David's sin with Bathsheba, was struck with illness as a consequence of David's actions. The life of the child represents a time of hope and potential divine intervention. David's actions during this time reflect the Jewish practice of seeking God's mercy through prayer and fasting.<p><b>I fasted and wept</b><br>Fasting and weeping are traditional expressions of mourning and repentance in Jewish culture. David's fasting is an act of humility and supplication, seeking God's favor. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Esther (<a href="/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3</a>) and the repentance of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). It demonstrates a deep reliance on God and a desire for His intervention.<p><b>for I said, &#8216;Who knows?</b><br>This phrase captures David's hope and uncertainty. It reflects a common biblical theme where humans, limited in understanding, appeal to God's mercy. Similar sentiments are expressed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>, where the prophet calls for repentance with the hope that God may relent and leave a blessing.<p><b>The LORD may be gracious to me</b><br>David appeals to the character of God, who is known for His grace and mercy. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God is often described as compassionate and gracious (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). David's hope is rooted in the possibility of divine grace, a theme that runs throughout the Bible and is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and let him live.&#8217;</b><br>David's plea is for the life of his child, hoping for a reversal of the judgment pronounced by the prophet Nathan. This reflects the biblical principle that God holds the power over life and death. While the child does not survive, this moment foreshadows the ultimate hope of resurrection and eternal life found in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and offers life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrating the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who became pregnant by David, leading to a series of tragic events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>God's messenger who confronted David about his sin, leading to David's repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The son born to David and Bathsheba, who became ill and died as a consequence of David's sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_consequences.htm">The Reality of Consequences</a></b><br>Sin has real and often painful consequences, even for those who are forgiven.
