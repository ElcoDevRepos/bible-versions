This war followed the death of Saul, Israel's first king, and the anointing of David as king over Judah. The term "protracted" indicates a lengthy and drawn-out conflict, which reflects the deep divisions within the nation. The house of Saul, led by Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, sought to maintain control over Israel, while David, anointed by God through the prophet Samuel, was destined to unify the kingdom. This prolonged struggle can be seen as a test of faith and patience for David, who had been promised the throne but had to wait for God's timing. The conflict also highlights the consequences of Saul's disobedience to God, as his house gradually loses power and influence.<p><b>And David grew stronger and stronger,</b><br>David's increasing strength is both a physical and spiritual reality. Militarily, David's forces were gaining victories and consolidating power, as seen in his successful campaigns and the loyalty of his mighty men. Spiritually, David's strength is attributed to his reliance on God and his anointing as king. This growth in strength is a fulfillment of God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, where the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. David's rise is also a type of Christ, who, despite opposition, grows in influence and ultimately establishes His kingdom. The phrase underscores the divine favor upon David, contrasting with the decline of Saul's house.<p><b>while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</b><br>The decline of Saul's house is a direct result of Saul's disobedience and rejection by God, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>. The weakening of Saul's house is evident in the loss of key battles, defections to David's side, and internal strife, such as the murder of Abner, Saul's former commander. This decline serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of turning away from God's commands. The weakening of Saul's house also sets the stage for the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule, fulfilling God's covenant promise to establish David's lineage, which ultimately leads to the coming of Jesus Christ, the eternal King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed king of Israel, David is growing stronger in his leadership and influence.

During this time Ish-bosheth was too weak to carry on actual war, and David was content to abide the fulfilment of the promises of the Lord in His own good time.<p><span class= "bld">Waxed stronger.</span>--Time was working in David's favour, partly, doubtless, on account of Ish-bosheth's manifest incompetence, partly from a growing appreciation of the character and prowess of David, and a fuller realisation that he was the divinely appointed sovereign. In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-19.htm" title="And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.">1Chronicles 12:19-22</a> there is an account of an important accession to David from the tribe of Manasseh on the eve of Saul's last battle, and a further mention of continued accessions to him "day by day." As the necessary result of this constant transference of strength to David, "the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was long war.</span> As Ishbosheth reigned only two years, and as "the house of Saul" is the phrase used, it seems probable that after Ishbosheth's murder, during the five years before David's election to the throne of all Israel, the house of Saul had some puppet representative at Mahanaim, and some commander in Abner's place. But after the death of this able man matters would go from bad to worse, and, though David probably remained on the defensive, yet the contrast between the peace and good government of Judah and the misery in Israel made all the tribes wish to put an end to a harassing civil war. It is plain, too, that the Philistines, repelled at first by Abner's skill, had again gained the ascendant, and regarded themselves so completely as the rulers of the country, that they resented immediately with summary violence the bold act of the northern tribes in choosing David to be their common king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The war</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mil&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
