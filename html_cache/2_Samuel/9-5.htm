David's actions reflect his covenant loyalty to Jonathan, Saul's son, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>. David's kindness to Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, is a demonstration of God's grace and mercy, prefiguring the grace offered through Jesus Christ. David's kingship is a type of Christ's eternal kingship, showing compassion and fulfilling promises.<p><b>from the house of Machir son of Ammiel</b><br>Machir was a man of influence and wealth, as indicated by his ability to provide refuge for Mephibosheth. This setting underscores the vulnerability of Mephibosheth, who was dependent on the kindness of others. Machir later supports David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>), indicating his loyalty to David. The mention of Machir's lineage, "son of Ammiel," provides historical context and authenticity to the narrative, grounding it in real familial ties.<p><b>in Lo-debar</b><br>Lo-debar was a town east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead. The name Lo-debar means "no pasture" or "no word," suggesting a place of desolation or obscurity. This location emphasizes Mephibosheth's lowly status and separation from the royal court. Theologically, it symbolizes humanity's spiritual barrenness before being brought into the presence of the King, akin to the redemption and restoration found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his leadership.
