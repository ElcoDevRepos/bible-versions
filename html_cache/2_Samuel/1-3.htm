This question is significant as it sets the stage for the revelation of Saul and Jonathan's deaths. In biblical narratives, questions often lead to pivotal moments of revelation or decision. David's inquiry also demonstrates his leadership and responsibility, as he seeks to understand the situation fully before responding. This moment foreshadows David's eventual role as king, where discernment and inquiry will be crucial.<p><b>David asked.</b><br>David, at this point, is not yet king but is recognized as a leader. His actions and questions are indicative of his character, which is often portrayed as seeking God's will and understanding the circumstances before acting. This reflects the biblical theme of seeking wisdom and guidance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trust in the Lord and acknowledgment of Him are emphasized for direction.<p><b>"I have escaped from the Israelite camp," he replied.</b><br>The messenger's response indicates a recent and significant event, as he has fled from the battlefield where the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines. This escape suggests urgency and the gravity of the situation. Historically, the Israelites were often in conflict with the Philistines, who were a significant threat during Saul's reign. The mention of the Israelite camp connects to the broader narrative of Israel's struggle for survival and identity in the Promised Land. This escape also foreshadows the transition of leadership from Saul to David, as the defeat marks the end of Saul's reign and the beginning of David's rise to power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

He certainly here claims to have been a part of the "camp of Israel." He tells David the general facts of the defeat, and the death of Saul and Jonathan, as they really occurred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span> Non-combatants would hang about the army, watching, as soon as the battle had begun, the fortunes of the day, and immediately that they saw the impending defeat of their own side, would think chiefly of their personal safety. But for an active young man the opportunity would then have come for booty. The Philistines, in pursuit of the enemy, would soon leave the battlefield in their rear, and multitudes would quickly prowl about it to plunder the dead. While so busied, the Amalekite falsely represents himself as having come by chance upon the wounded, but still living, Saul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_335.htm">Strong's 335: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where?, how?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have you come from?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
