Saul's pursuit of David and his eventual downfall created a legacy of enmity between their houses. In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was common for new dynasties to eliminate the previous ruling family to secure their own reign. The speaker acknowledges that, by the customs of the time, David had the right to execute Saul's descendants to prevent any claims to the throne. This reflects the historical context of royal succession and the potential threat posed by surviving members of a former king's family.<p><b>yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table</b><br>This phrase highlights David's mercy and grace, as he chose to show kindness to Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, by allowing him to eat at the king's table. This act of generosity is significant in the cultural context, as sharing a meal was a sign of acceptance and favor. It also reflects David's covenant with Jonathan, Saul's son and Mephibosheth's father, to show kindness to his family (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>). This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who extends grace and fellowship to those who might otherwise be considered enemies or outsiders.<p><b>What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?</b><br>Here, Mephibosheth expresses humility and gratitude, recognizing that he has already received more than he deserves. This reflects a biblical theme of unmerited favor, where individuals acknowledge their unworthiness in light of the grace they have received. It also underscores the idea of contentment and trust in the king's justice and mercy. This attitude can be connected to other scriptural teachings on humility and reliance on God's provision, such as in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>, where Paul speaks of being content in all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul, Mephibosheth was crippled in both feet.

This reflects God's grace towards us, who, like Mephibosheth, are undeserving.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_gratitude.htm">Humility and Gratitude</a></b><br>Mephibosheth's response to David is marked by humility and gratitude. He acknowledges his unworthiness and the king's generosity.

In ancient Near Eastern practice, a new dynasty routinely eliminated rivals (<a href="/2_samuel/21-5.htm">2 Samuel 21:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s relentless pursuit of David made that verdict just (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17&#8211;20</a>; 26:18).<p>&#8226; By acknowledging this, Mephibosheth confesses both personal unworthiness and the justice of the king&#8217;s authority&#8212;much like Isaiah&#8217;s &#8220;Woe is me&#8221; before the holy Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement prepares the ground for grace; when guilt is owned, mercy can be magnified (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table</b><p>&#8226; Grace now takes center stage. David had already pledged covenant kindness to Jonathan&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14&#8211;17</a>) and fulfilled it in <a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>,13: &#8220;So Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s table like one of the king&#8217;s sons&#8221;.<p>&#8226; To &#8220;eat at the king&#8217;s table&#8221; pictures full acceptance, protection, and provision&#8212;echoes of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> and a faint preview of the Lord&#8217;s Table where sinners sit reconciled (<a href="/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s mercy contrasts sharply with the expected justice, mirroring God&#8217;s treatment of us in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?</b><p>&#8226; Having received undeserved favor, Mephibosheth relinquishes any claim to more.

Rather than pressing for personal advantage after Ziba&#8217;s accusations (<a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1&#8211;4</a>), Mephibosheth yields to the king&#8217;s decision (19:30).<p>&#8226; True gratitude silences entitlement; it shifts focus from rights to relationship&#8212;a pattern Paul commends (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Mephibosheth&#8217;s words trace a gospel arc: he acknowledges deserved judgment, marvels at unmerited kindness, and responds with humble surrender.
