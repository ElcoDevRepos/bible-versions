In the context of Absalom's rebellion, Hushai was sent back to Jerusalem by David to act as a spy and counter the counsel of Ahithophel, Absalom's advisor. Zadok and Abiathar were the high priests during David's reign, and their involvement highlights the intertwining of religious and political roles in ancient Israel. Their presence signifies the importance of divine guidance and support in the political affairs of the kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel</b><br>Ahithophel was known for his wise counsel, and his advice was highly regarded, almost as if one were consulting the word of God. His support for Absalom was a significant blow to David, as Ahithophel's counsel was often seen as infallible. The elders of Israel, representing the tribal leaders and influential figures, were crucial in legitimizing Absalom's claim to the throne. This phrase underscores the gravity of the situation David faced, as Absalom had the backing of both a trusted advisor and the nation's leaders.<p><b>and this is what I have advised.</b><br>Hushai's role was to provide alternative counsel to Absalom, thereby creating confusion and buying time for David. His advice was designed to appeal to Absalom's vanity and ambition, contrasting with Ahithophel's more direct and strategic approach. This phrase highlights the theme of divine providence, as God used Hushai's counsel to thwart Ahithophel's plans, ultimately preserving David's kingship. It also reflects the biblical motif of God using seemingly weak or unlikely individuals to achieve His purposes, a theme seen throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai.htm">Hushai</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David, who acts as a spy to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel and protect David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_and_abiathar.htm">Zadok and Abiathar</a></b><br>Priests who remain loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion, serving as messengers and intermediaries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A former counselor to David who defects to Absalom, known for his wise but ultimately flawed counsel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son who rebels against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_israel.htm">The Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders who are swayed by the counsel of Ahithophel and Hushai during Absalom's rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite human wisdom and planning, God's purposes will ultimately prevail.
