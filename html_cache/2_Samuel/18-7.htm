The "people of Israel" here indicates the factions that supported Absalom's rebellion against his father, King David. This internal conflict highlights the division within the nation of Israel during this period. David's "servants" refers to his loyal military forces, led by commanders such as Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. This victory underscores God's continued favor upon David, despite his personal failings, and fulfills the prophecy of Nathan that the sword would not depart from David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>). The defeat of Absalom's forces can be seen as a divine intervention to restore the rightful king, David, to his throne.<p><b>and the slaughter was great that day&#8212;twenty thousand men</b><br>The phrase "the slaughter was great" emphasizes the severity and scale of the battle. The loss of twenty thousand men indicates a significant and devastating defeat for Absalom's forces. This large number reflects the intense and brutal nature of ancient warfare, where battles often resulted in high casualties. The forest of Ephraim, where the battle took place, may have contributed to the high number of casualties, as the terrain would have been difficult to navigate and could have led to additional deaths beyond the combat itself. This event serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of rebellion and civil war, and it highlights the cost of Absalom's ambition and the resulting strife within the nation. Theologically, it underscores the theme of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's purposes through the restoration of David's rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, anointed by God, who is leading his forces against the rebellion led by his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has declared himself king and is leading a rebellion against his father.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_servants.htm">David&#8217;s Servants</a></b><br>The loyal soldiers and commanders who remain faithful to David and fight on his behalf.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the forces aligned with Absalom in the civil conflict against David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>A significant conflict in the forest of Ephraim where David's forces achieve a decisive victory over Absalom's army.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_conflict.htm">God's Sovereignty in Conflict</a></b><br>Despite the chaos of civil war, God&#8217;s sovereign plan prevails.
