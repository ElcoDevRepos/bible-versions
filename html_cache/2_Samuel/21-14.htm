Saul, the first king of Israel, and Jonathan, his son and David's close friend, had died in battle against the Philistines. Their bodies were initially desecrated by the Philistines, but the men of Jabesh-gilead retrieved them. This act of burial is a fulfillment of honoring the dead, a significant cultural practice in ancient Israel, reflecting the importance of proper burial rites.<p><b>in Zela in the land of Benjamin</b><br>Zela was a town within the tribal territory of Benjamin, Saul's own tribe. This location is significant as it represents a return to their ancestral roots. The land of Benjamin is situated in the central highlands of Israel, a region that held historical and strategic importance. The burial in their tribal land underscores the restoration of honor to Saul's lineage and the reconciliation of past conflicts.<p><b>in the tomb of Saul&#8217;s father Kish</b><br>Burying Saul and Jonathan in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father, emphasizes the restoration of family honor and lineage. Kish was a Benjamite of some standing, and this burial site would have been a place of familial significance. This act also symbolizes the continuity of the family line and the respect for one's ancestors, a deeply held value in Israelite culture.<p><b>After they had done everything the king had commanded</b><br>This phrase indicates obedience to King David's orders, reflecting the importance of following the king's directives in ancient Israel. David's command to bury Saul and Jonathan properly was part of his efforts to bring peace and healing to the nation after a period of famine, which was believed to be a divine judgment related to Saul's actions against the Gibeonites.<p><b>God answered their prayers for the land</b><br>The resolution of the famine following the burial suggests divine approval and the restoration of favor. In the biblical narrative, the land's prosperity is often linked to the people's faithfulness and obedience to God. This outcome highlights the belief in a covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessing. The act of burying Saul and Jonathan can be seen as a step towards national reconciliation and divine blessing, aligning with the biblical theme of repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose disobedience to God led to his downfall and the eventual transfer of kingship to David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, known for his loyalty and bravery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who sought to honor Saul and Jonathan by giving them a proper burial.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zela.htm">Zela</a></b><br>A town in the land of Benjamin where Saul and Jonathan were buried.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kish.htm">Kish</a></b><br>Saul's father, whose tomb became the final resting place for Saul and Jonathan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_dead.htm">Respect for the Dead</a></b><br>The burial of Saul and Jonathan underscores the importance of honoring those who have passed, regardless of past conflicts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_authority.htm">Obedience to Authority</a></b><br>The people followed King David's command, demonstrating the biblical principle of respecting and obeying God-ordained leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation_and_peace.htm">Reconciliation and Peace</a></b><br>David's actions reflect a heart of reconciliation, seeking to make peace with Saul's legacy and family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_response_to_righteous_actions.htm">God's Response to Righteous Actions</a></b><br>After the burial, God answered prayers for the land, illustrating that God honors righteous actions and intentions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_honor.htm">Legacy and Honor</a></b><br>The burial in the family tomb signifies the importance of family legacy and the honor due to one's ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_21_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_21_14_Honor_past_commitments.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:14 emphasize the importance of honoring past commitments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_obedience_in_2_Sam_21_14.htm">What role does obedience play in resolving conflicts, as seen in 2 Samuel 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_prayer_s_power_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of "God was moved by prayer" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_honor_God_s_covenant.htm">In what ways does this verse connect to honoring God's covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_passage_guide_us_in_trials.htm">How does this passage encourage us to seek God's guidance in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_relocate_Saul_and_Jonathan_s_bones.htm">Why did David move Saul and Jonathan's bones in 2 Samuel 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_21_14_burial_s_significance.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:14 reflect on the importance of burial practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/David_s_character_in_2_Samuel_21_14.htm">What does 2 Samuel 21:14 reveal about David's character and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_2_samuel_21_events.htm">In 2 Samuel 21, where is the historical or archaeological evidence to validate or challenge the reported famine and the Gibeonite retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_punish_all_for_saul's_sin.htm">In 2 Samuel 21:1, how can a just God hold an entire nation accountable with famine for Saul&#8217;s sin?

It has not been identified, but was probably near Gibeah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bones of Saul and Jonathan.</span> The Septuagint adds, "and the bones of them that were hanged." As it is expressly said in ver. 13 that these bones were collected, we cannot doubt but that the remains of the seven grandsons were interred with those of Saul and Jonathan, in the tomb of Kish, their common ancestor. But whether the Septuagint has preserved words that have dropped out of the Hebrew text, or has added them to make the fact plain, is more than we can answer. <span class="cmt_word">Zelah</span>. Nothing more is known of this place than that it was in the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they buried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
