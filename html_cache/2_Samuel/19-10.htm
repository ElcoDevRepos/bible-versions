The anointing of Absalom signifies a significant shift in loyalty, reflecting the people's desire for change and perhaps dissatisfaction with David's rule. This act of anointing parallels the earlier anointing of Saul and David, indicating a formal recognition of leadership. Theologically, it underscores the human tendency to seek leaders who align with immediate desires rather than divine will, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5-7</a> when Israel demanded a king.<p><b>has died in battle.</b><br>Absalom's death marks the end of his rebellion and serves as a divine judgment against his usurpation. His demise in battle fulfills the prophecy of Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God declared that the sword would never depart from David's house due to his sin with Bathsheba. Absalom's death also echoes the fate of other rebellious figures in Scripture, such as Korah in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, emphasizing the consequences of opposing God's anointed.<p><b>So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the people of Israel to consider their silence regarding David's return to power. It reflects a moment of introspection and decision, urging the tribes to realign with God's chosen king. The call to restore David can be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate restoration and reign of Jesus, the King of Kings, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>. The people's hesitation may also reflect fear of retribution or uncertainty about David's response, highlighting the complexities of political and personal reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who led a rebellion against his father.

The verse calls God&#8217;s people to reject false allegiances, repent without delay, and restore the rightful King to His place of honor in their lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">We anointed over us.</span>--There is no other mention of the anointing of Absalom, and it certainly would not have been performed by the high-priests.

It is under these circumstances that David shows that politic power which had so often before stood him in good stead. The LXX. very unnecessarily places at the end of this verse the clause which is found at the end of <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm" title="And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.">2Samuel 19:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom, whom we anointed over us.</span> It is evident from these words that there had been some solemn anointing and appointment of Absalom, and this accounts for the manner in which his partisans are always described as "Israel," while David's men are simply "his servants." With this anointment there must also have been a formal renunciation of David's rule, and, being thus dethroned, he does not attempt to return until the nation summons him back. As the flight of David narrated in ch. 16. was extremely hurried, the conspirators must have kept their counsel well, and whatever rumours reached him apparently he disregarded. But meanwhile representatives of the tribes secretly convened at Hebron had claimed to act in the name of Israel, and, chosen a new king. The words certainly imply that, had Absalom lived, the Israelites would have considered themselves bound to obey him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Absalom,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
