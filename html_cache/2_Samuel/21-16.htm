The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, often at war with them. Giants in the Bible, such as Goliath, are often seen as formidable foes, representing challenges that God's people must overcome. Ishbi-benob's presence in the narrative highlights the ongoing threat from the Philistines even after David's earlier victories.<p><b>a descendant of Rapha</b><br>Rapha is often associated with the Rephaim, a group of ancient giants mentioned in the Old Testament. The Rephaim were considered mighty and fearsome warriors. This lineage emphasizes the physical and symbolic threat posed by Ishbi-benob, as he comes from a line of formidable adversaries. The mention of his ancestry underscores the persistent nature of Israel's enemies.<p><b>whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels</b><br>The weight of Ishbi-benob's spear, approximately 7.5 pounds or 3.4 kilograms, signifies his strength and the threat he posed. Bronze was a common material for weapons in the ancient Near East, and the mention of its weight indicates the formidable nature of his armament. This detail parallels the description of Goliath's weaponry, drawing a connection between the two giants and the challenges they represent.<p><b>and who was bearing a new sword</b><br>The mention of a "new sword" suggests that Ishbi-benob was well-equipped and prepared for battle. In ancient warfare, having new or superior weapons could provide a significant advantage. This detail highlights the seriousness of the threat to David, as Ishbi-benob was not only strong but also well-armed.<p><b>resolved to kill David</b><br>Ishbi-benob's intention to kill David underscores the ongoing danger faced by the king, despite his past victories. David, as the anointed king of Israel, often faced threats from both external enemies and internal strife. This moment reflects the spiritual and physical battles that David encountered throughout his life. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's chosen leaders over their adversaries, a theme that resonates with the messianic hope found in the lineage of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishbi-benob.htm">Ishbi-benob</a></b><br>A Philistine warrior, described as a descendant of Rapha, indicating he was a giant.

Scripture places us in a real battlefield where David, now older (<a href="/2_samuel/21-15.htm">2 Samuel 21:15</a>), is vulnerable.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Ishbi-benob&#8221; is introduced without prior mention, highlighting that new threats can arise even late in life. Just as David once surprised Israel as a youthful champion (<a href="/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32-37</a>), so an unexpected enemy now targets him.<p>&#8226; The historical setting is affirmed elsewhere when the same list of giant-killings appears in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, underscoring that this is reliable history, not legend.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a descendant of Rapha</b><p>&#8226; The phrase links Ishbi-benob to the Rephaim, a group of unusually large warriors (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Goliath is called &#8220;the champion&#8230;from Gath&#8221; and described as a giant (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>). Now another of that lineage challenges David, showing the ongoing spiritual and physical battle Israel faced with the Philistines (<a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past victories over the Rephaim (<a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; 13:12) assure us He remains sovereign over present dangers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels</b><p>&#8226; Three hundred shekels (about 7&#8211;8 pounds) signals exceptional strength, though still lighter than Goliath&#8217;s 600-shekel spear (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture uses weapon weight to draw a stark contrast between human might and divine deliverance. David&#8217;s earlier triumph with only a sling (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>) reminds us that victory depends on the Lord, not on impressive armaments (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and who was bearing a new sword</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;new&#8221; sword pictures Ishbi-benob as freshly equipped and confident. Technological or tactical advantages never unsettle God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, the sword theme circles back to David: he once used Goliath&#8217;s own sword (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>; 21:9). Here the enemy&#8217;s blade threatens him, but God again proves faithful (<a href="/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>resolved to kill David</b><p>&#8226; The verb stresses deliberate intention. Decades earlier Saul &#8220;sought to pin David to the wall&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a>); now a Philistine giant takes up the same murderous resolve. Satanic opposition to God&#8217;s anointed persists across generations (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s exhaustion (<a href="/2_samuel/21-15.htm">2 Samuel 21:15</a>) sets the stage for Abishai&#8217;s rescue (21:17), illustrating the body of believers rallying to protect their leader (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode foreshadows the ultimate preservation of the Messiah&#8217;s line, ensuring the promise of <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> cannot fail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16</a> records a fresh giant, formidable weapons, and a focused intent to end David&#8217;s life.

But surely the man's name would not be Hebrew; he was a Raphah, and we shall not be able to explain his name until we know the language of the Rephaim. <span class="cmt_word">Of the sons of the giant;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">of the children of the Raphah</span>; that is, he belonged to the race of the Rephaim, the word not signifying "sons," but the members of a stock. It is translated "children" in <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22, 28</a>, etc. (For the Rephaim, see note on 2 Samuel 5:18.) "The Raphah" may be the mythic progenitor of the Rephaim, but more probably it is simply the singular of "Rephaim," and "children of the Raphah" a more poetic way of describing the race. <span class="cmt_word">Three hundred</span> shekels. It weighed, therefore, about eight pounds; the spearhead of Goliath was just twice as heavy (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Girded with a new.</span> The Vulgate supplies "sword," which the Authorized Version has adopted. The Septuagint reads a "mace" instead of "new;" others think that he had a new suit of armour. If the narrator had thought it of sufficient importance to let us know that the article was new, he would scarcely have left the thing itself unspecified. It is evident, however, that the Septuagint did not read <span class="accented">hadasha</span>, "new," but the name of some strange warlike instrument, which being unknown to the scribes, they substituted for it a word which they did know, but which makes no sense. We cannot, however, depend upon the translation of the Septuagint, "mace." The want of special knowledge on the part of the translators of the Septuagint, though partly accounted for by the long absence from Palestine of its authors, and their having to depend entirely upon such knowledge of their language as survived at Alexandria, is more than we should have expected or can quite understand. Here, however, there is nothing remarkable in their not knowing the exact meaning of this carious weapon of the Rephaite; but plainly it could not be a mace, but must have been something that could be gift upon him. The Authorized Version, moreover, gives a look of probability to the insertion of "sword," which is wanting in the Hebrew; for it does not connect his purpose of killing David with the hadasha. The Hebrew is, "And Ishbo-benob, who was a Rephaite, and whose spear weighed three hundred shekels, and who was girt with an hadasha; and he thought to smite David." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Ishbi-benob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
