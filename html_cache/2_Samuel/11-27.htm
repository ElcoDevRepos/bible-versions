Bathsheba mourned for her husband Uriah, who was killed in battle. This period reflects the cultural and religious practices of the time, emphasizing the importance of honoring the deceased.<p><b>David had her brought to his house</b><br>David's actions here reflect his authority as king, but also his attempt to legitimize his relationship with Bathsheba after the death of her husband. This act can be seen as a political move to cover up the sin of adultery and the orchestrated death of Uriah. It highlights the misuse of power and the moral decline in David's kingship.<p><b>and she became his wife and bore him a son</b><br>Bathsheba becoming David's wife and bearing him a son signifies the continuation of David's lineage, which is crucial in the biblical narrative. However, this union was born out of sin, and the child conceived in this context would later die, as a consequence of David's actions (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>). This event foreshadows the future turmoil in David's family and kingdom.<p><b>But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual evaluation of David's actions. Despite being a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), David's sin is clearly condemned by God. This highlights the biblical theme that no one is above God's law, and even the anointed king is accountable to divine standards. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance, which David eventually demonstrates in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman with whom David committed adultery; she became pregnant and later married David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>Bathsheba's husband, a loyal soldier in David's army, whom David had killed to cover up his sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who was displeased with David's actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the capital of Israel and the location of David's palace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, even when hidden from others, is never hidden from God.

Divine holiness sees, judges, and eventually exposes every deed, calling sinners&#8212;like David, and like us&#8212;to humble repentance and wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Bare him a son.</span>--Several months must have passed since the beginning of David's course of sin, and as yet his conscience had not brought him to a sense of what he had done, nor had the prophet Nathan been sent to him. It is to be remembered that during all this time David was not only the civil ruler of his people, but also the head of the theocracy, the great upholder of the worship and the service of God, and his psalms were used as the vehicle of the people's devotion. If it be asked why he should have been left so long without being brought to a conviction of his sin, one obvious reason is, that this sin might be openly fastened upon him beyond all possibility of denial by the birth of the child. But besides this, however hardened David may appear to have been in passing from one crime to another in the effort to conceal his guilt, yet it is scarcely possible that his conscience should not have been meantime at work and oppressing him with that sense of unconfessed and unforgiven sin which prepared him at last for the visit of Nathan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She... bare him a son.</span> This would be the child whose death is recorded in the next chapter. Afterwards she bare David four sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>), of whom one was Solomon, and another Nathan, the ancestor of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">The thing... displeased the Lord.</span> It was probably during the time of David's victories that success began to work in him its usual results. Too commonly men who have conquered kingdoms have been vanquished by their own strong passions; and David had always evinced a keen appetite for sensuous pleasures. Even at Hebron he had multiplied unto himself wives, and now, raised by repeated victory to be the lord of a vast empire, he ceased to be "base in his own sight" (<a href="/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>), and lost his self control. And, as was to be expected in a man of such strong qualities, his fall was terrible. But this declaration of the inspired narrator is not made solely for ethical reasons, but is the key to all that follows up to the end of ch. 20. In this chapter we have had the history of David's sin; a year's respite succeeds, as if God would wait and see whether the sinner's own conscience would waken up, and bring him to repentance; but it slumbers on. Then comes the message of reproof, fellowed by earnest penitence, and severe punishment. It was, perhaps, during this year of hardened persistence in crime that Amnon and his cousin Jonadab also gave the reins to their passions, and prepared the way for the first of the series of crimes that polluted David's home. An early repentance might have saved the son; but the absence of paternal discipline, the loss of respect for his father, and the evil influence of that father's bad example, all urged on the son to the commission of his abominable crime. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when the [time of] mourning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
