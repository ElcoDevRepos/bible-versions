This act symbolized Tamar's profound grief and humiliation after being violated by her half-brother Amnon. The use of ashes as a symbol of mourning is seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as in <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, indicating a shared cultural practice of expressing sorrow and repentance.<p><b>and tore her robe</b><br>Tearing one's garments was another traditional expression of grief and despair in biblical times. Tamar's robe was significant because it was a garment worn by virgin daughters of the king, as noted earlier in the chapter. By tearing it, Tamar was not only expressing her personal anguish but also signifying the loss of her status and purity. This act of tearing garments is seen in other biblical narratives, such as when Jacob tore his clothes upon believing Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>).<p><b>And putting her hand on her head</b><br>Placing a hand on the head was a gesture of lamentation and shame. This physical expression of sorrow is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals express their grief through bodily gestures. It underscores the depth of Tamar's emotional and social devastation.<p><b>she went away crying aloud</b><br>Tamar's public lamentation highlights the severity of her situation. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's honor was closely tied to her chastity, and Tamar's loud cries would have been a public declaration of the injustice she suffered. This act of crying aloud can be seen as a call for justice, similar to the cries of the oppressed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, where the righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The daughter of King David, who was violated by her half-brother Amnon.

(<a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), Mordecai donned them over national peril (<a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1&#8211;3</a>), and Jeremiah urged Israel to &#8220;roll in the dust&#8221; over sin (<a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>).<p>- Tamar&#8217;s choice signals that what happened to her was catastrophic, not a private slight but a life-altering tragedy that required visible lament.<p>- By literally placing ashes on her royal head she also confesses that even a king&#8217;s daughter stands leveled by sin&#8217;s devastation (<a href="/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a> reminds us we are but &#8220;dust and ashes&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tore her robe</b><p>- She &#8220;tore the robe, the richly ornamented robe which was on her.&#8221; The previous verse notes that such robes identified the king&#8217;s virgin daughters (<a href="/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>).<p>- Tearing garments is a biblical language of brokenness: Reuben tore his clothes over Joseph&#8217;s apparent death (<a href="/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>), David did the same for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>), Ezra over national sin (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>).<p>- For Tamar, ripping this special robe announces the shattering of her honored status; innocence has been forcibly taken.<p>- The act also implicitly protests the crime. While <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a> calls God&#8217;s people to &#8220;rend your heart and not your garments,&#8221; Tamar&#8217;s torn robe shows her heart already pierced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hand on her head</b><p>- &#8220;She put her hand on her head.&#8221; The gesture in Scripture often marks shame and helplessness: Judah will &#8220;put their hands on their heads&#8221; when exposed (<a href="/jeremiah/2-37.htm">Jeremiah 2:37</a>); princes are told, &#8220;Bow low and sit, for your beautiful crowns have fallen from your heads&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/13-18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>).<p>- Tamar covers her head not in concealment but in sorrow&#8212;an outward sign that her dignity feels crushed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went away</b><p>- &#8220;She went away.&#8221; Moments earlier Amnon&#8217;s servant &#8220;put her out and bolted the door&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/13-17.htm">2 Samuel 13:17&#8211;18</a>). Now she must walk the path of rejection.<p>- The language parallels other painful departures: Hagar fleeing from Sarai (<a href="/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>); David leaving Jerusalem weeping (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>).<p>- Tamar&#8217;s exit underscores that victims are often forced from the very spaces where wrong was done, compounding the hurt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Crying aloud</b><p>- She went &#8220;crying aloud as she went.&#8221; Her continual outcry is both lament and testimony.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a> expected a violated woman to cry out; Tamar&#8217;s voice affirms the assault&#8217;s reality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a> urges tears to run &#8220;like a river day and night&#8221;; Tamar embodies such unrestrained grief.<p>- By refusing silence, she exposes sin, invites witnesses, and confronts a community tempted to hide family shame.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every movement in <a href="/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a> is literal history and lasting instruction.

If David had foreseen this sad sight when giving way to his passion for Bathsheba, he would have felt that sin is indeed "folly," and that its pleasure is followed by shame and bitter anguish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Tamar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8559.htm">Strong's 8559: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tamar -- daughter-in-law of Judah, also two Israelite women, also a place South of the Dead Sea </span><br /><br /><span class="word">put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
