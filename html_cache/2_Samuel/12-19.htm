The whispering of his servants indicated that they were discussing something of great importance and likely distressing. In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants often communicated sensitive information discreetly to avoid causing public alarm or distress to their masters. This behavior reflects the cultural norms of the time, where direct communication of bad news was often avoided to prevent immediate emotional reactions.<p><b>he perceived that the child was dead</b><br>David's perception indicates his awareness and understanding of the situation. This perception was likely influenced by the context of the preceding events, where the prophet Nathan had pronounced judgment on David for his sin with Bathsheba, stating that the child born to them would die (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>). David's understanding of the gravity of his actions and the consequences foretold by Nathan would have made him sensitive to any signs indicating the child's fate.<p><b>So he asked his servants, &#8220;Is the child dead?&#8221;</b><br>David's direct question to his servants shows his readiness to confront the reality of the situation. In the cultural and historical context, it was not uncommon for kings to seek confirmation of events from their servants or advisors. This moment also reflects David's acceptance of the divine judgment pronounced by Nathan, as he seeks to confirm what he already suspects.<p><b>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; they replied</b><br>The servants' confirmation of the child's death fulfills Nathan's prophecy and marks a pivotal moment in David's life. This event is a turning point, leading to David's repentance and subsequent actions. The death of the child can be seen as a type of Christ in that it represents the innocent suffering for the sins of another, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the sins of humanity. This moment also connects to the broader biblical theme of sin, judgment, and redemption, illustrating the consequences of sin and the possibility of restoration through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrating the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_david.htm">Servants of David</a></b><br>Individuals in David's court who were aware of the child's illness and death, and who communicated this to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The son born to David and Bathsheba, who became ill and died as a consequence of David's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who became David's wife after Uriah's death and the mother of the child who died.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Nathan plays a crucial role in the preceding account by confronting David about his sin and pronouncing God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has real and often painful consequences, not only for the sinner but also for those around them.
