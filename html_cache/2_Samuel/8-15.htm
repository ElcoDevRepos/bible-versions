This period marks a significant transition from the tribal confederation of the Judges to a centralized monarchy. David's leadership is seen as a type of Christ, who unites all believers under His spiritual reign (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>). The phrase also highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, promising a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><b>and administered justice and righteousness</b><br>David's administration of justice and righteousness reflects the ideal kingly role in Israel, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that true leadership involves upholding God's laws and ensuring fairness and equity. David's commitment to justice prefigures the Messianic reign of Christ, who will establish perfect justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). The Hebrew terms for justice (mishpat) and righteousness (tsedaqah) often appear together in the Old Testament, emphasizing God's character and His expectations for leaders (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p><b>for all his people</b><br>David's governance extended to all his people, indicating inclusivity and impartiality in his rule. This phrase suggests that David's justice was not limited to a select group but was intended for the entire nation of Israel. It reflects the biblical ideal of a shepherd-king who cares for all his flock, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The phrase also points to the unity and peace that characterized David's reign, a foreshadowing of the peace Christ brings to His people (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership qualities.

The verse affirms that godly authority, just decisions, and inclusive care belong together&#8212;ultimately revealing the character of the coming King who will reign forever in perfect justice and righteousness for all who are His.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David executed judgment and justice.</span> There was very little real truth in Absalom's fault finding with the administration of justice (<a href="/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>), unless we suppose - what is only too probable - that David, after his terrible crimes of murder and adultery, became lax in the discharge of his judicial duties. Here, at this period of his life, he was a zealous judge at home, as well as a brave and skilful general. He was one of those many sided characters who are great in a multitude of ways. Like Julius Caesar and our own Alfred, he was as distinguished in the arts of peace as in those of war. And thus, while his first care was for the establishment of religion, and while even the singing in the sanctuary was not beneath his notice, he also, even in the midst of dangerous wars, gave careful attention to the orderly government of his kingdom and the maintenance of right and law. We have already seen with what consummate skill he selected a capital immediately that he was made king of all Israel. Saul had done much in war. Though finally defeated at Gilboa, he had taught the Israelites their strength, and laid the foundations of David's empire; but he had done nothing to consolidate the tribes, or provide tribunals for the settlement of disputed legal rights or the punishment of crimes. Israel was as loose an aggregate of discordant atoms at his death as it was at his appointment; and the maintenance of order was left to the caprice of local sheiks. Samuel had done far more for the internal development and consolidation of the people than Saul; but it was David who made them into a nation. The continuance of his work was frustrated by the extravagance of Solomon, the folly of Rehoboam, and the ambition of the restless tribe of Ephraim; but the two parts into which his realm was broken at least held together, and there never again was danger of such anarchy and threatened disintegration as existed in the times of the judges. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reigned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;l&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
