Their father, Rimmon, was from Beeroth, one of the Gibeonite cities (<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). The Gibeonites were a group that had made a treaty with Israel during Joshua's conquest of Canaan, which later led to complex relations with Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>). The mention of their lineage highlights the mixed heritage and complex political alliances in Israel at the time.<p><b>set out and arrived at the house of Ish-bosheth</b><br>Ish-bosheth was the son of Saul and was made king over Israel by Abner, Saul's military commander, after Saul's death (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-10</a>). His reign was marked by instability and conflict with David, who was anointed king over Judah. The house of Ish-bosheth signifies his royal residence, likely in Mahanaim, a city east of the Jordan River, which served as his capital during the civil war with David (<a href="/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>).<p><b>in the heat of the day</b><br>This phrase indicates the time of day, which was typically the hottest and often a time for rest in the ancient Near East.

This detail underscores the vulnerability of Ish-bosheth, as he was resting and unguarded. It also reflects the cultural norm of the time, where leaders and common people alike would pause their activities during the hottest part of the day.
