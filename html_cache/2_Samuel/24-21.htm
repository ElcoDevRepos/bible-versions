The Jebusites were the original inhabitants of Jerusalem before David conquered the city (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). Araunah's question reflects the cultural norms of hospitality and deference to royalty. His use of "my lord" and "his servant" indicates a hierarchical relationship, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. This encounter occurs after David's census of Israel, which led to a divine judgment in the form of a plague (<a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24:1-15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;To buy your threshing floor,&#8221; David replied,</b><br>David's intention to purchase the threshing floor highlights the importance of this location. Threshing floors were open, flat areas used for separating grain from chaff, often situated on elevated ground to catch the wind. This particular site would later become the location of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), making it a significant place in biblical history. David's insistence on buying the land, rather than accepting it as a gift, underscores the principle of sacrifice; he would not offer to God something that cost him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p><b>&#8220;that I may build an altar to the LORD,&#8221;</b><br>Building an altar signifies an act of worship and atonement. In the Old Testament, altars were places where sacrifices were made to God, symbolizing repentance and seeking divine favor. David's desire to build an altar here is a response to the plague, seeking to appease God's wrath. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who would atone for the sins of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p><b>&#8220;so that the plague upon the people may be halted.&#8221;</b><br>The plague was a direct consequence of David's sin in conducting a census, which was seen as an act of pride and reliance on military strength rather than on God (<a href="/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1-7</a>). The cessation of the plague upon the building of the altar and offering of sacrifices demonstrates God's mercy and the power of intercessory acts. This event foreshadows the concept of Christ as the mediator who halts the plague of sin through His sacrifice (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who seeks to build an altar to the LORD to stop a plague affecting his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah.htm">Araunah</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owns the threshing floor that David wishes to purchase for building the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The location owned by Araunah, which David intends to buy to construct an altar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom David seeks to appease by building an altar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment affecting Israel, which David aims to halt through sacrifice and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_true_worship.htm">The Cost of True Worship</a></b><br>True worship often requires personal sacrifice.

By purchasing the threshing floor, building an altar, and offering sacrifice, David embraces accountability, honors rightful ownership, and seeks God&#8217;s mercy for his nation. The verse showcases a ruler&#8217;s humility, a servant&#8217;s reverence, and the Lord&#8217;s provision of atonement&#8212;pointing ahead to the ultimate sacrifice that forever halts the plague of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mad&#183;d&#363;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4069.htm">Strong's 4069: </a> </span><span class="str2">Why? for what reason?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has my lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
