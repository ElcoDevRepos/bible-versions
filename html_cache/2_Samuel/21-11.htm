In the context of ancient Israel, the king was often informed of significant events by messengers or advisors. This reflects the hierarchical structure of the monarchy, where information was crucial for decision-making. David, as a king, was responsible for maintaining justice and order, and being informed was essential for his role.<p><b>what Saul&#8217;s concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done,</b><br>Rizpah was a concubine of Saul, Israel's first king, which places her within the royal household, though with a lower status than a wife. Her actions, which involved a public display of mourning and protection of the bodies of her sons, highlight the cultural practices of mourning and the importance of burial rites in ancient Israel. Rizpah's lineage as the daughter of Aiah may indicate her noble or significant family background, which could have added weight to her actions. Her story is a poignant example of maternal devotion and has been seen as a type of intercession, reflecting themes of sacrifice and advocacy. This event connects to the broader narrative of Saul's house and the consequences of his actions, as well as the fulfillment of justice and the restoration of order under David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership.

Now fresh news presses him to finish the work of national repentance.<p>&#8211; A true shepherd-king does not ignore grief among his people; he moves toward it, just as the Good Shepherd later &#8220;saw the crowds and had compassion on them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what Saul&#8217;s concubine</b><p>&#8211; The mention of &#8220;Saul&#8217;s concubine&#8221; recalls the lingering tension between the old dynasty and the new (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>; 16:21-22).<p>&#8211; Concubines in royal households symbolized dynasty and inheritance (<a href="/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-21.htm">1 Kings 2:21-22</a>). By honoring one of Saul&#8217;s, David publicly affirms that the former king&#8217;s household still matters before God.<p>&#8211; In God&#8217;s economy, covenant mercy reaches backward as well as forward; unfinished wrongs must be set right (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rizpah, daughter of Aiah,</b><p>&#8211; Scripture lingers on her name twice in this chapter (21:8, 10), spotlighting a mother who will not abandon her sons.<p>&#8211; Her vigil mirrors earlier acts of covenant love:<p>&#8226; Jabesh-gilead&#8217;s rescue of Saul&#8217;s body (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Hannah&#8217;s yearly journeys for Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary standing near her crucified Son (<a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>).<p>&#8211; Such faithfulness shines whether or not the world notices&#8212;and in God&#8217;s timing it always reaches the king&#8217;s ears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had done</b><p>&#8211; Rizpah &#8220;took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock&#8230; she did not allow the birds of the air&#8230; or the beasts of the field&#8221; (21:10).<p>&#8211; Her actions preach several truths:<p>&#8226; Respect for the dead accords with God&#8217;s law not to leave a body exposed overnight (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Persistent intercession&#8212;day and night&#8212;moves heaven and earth (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine repentance must be matched by tangible righteousness; David responds by retrieving the bones of Saul and Jonathan for honorable burial (21:12-13).<p>&#8211; The result? &#8220;After that, God answered prayer for the land&#8221; (21:14).

A grieving mother&#8217;s steadfast love is reported to a godly king, and he acts. David&#8217;s response unites mercy with justice, heals a national wound, and opens the way for God to lift the famine. The verse reminds us that God sees every hidden act of faithfulness and often uses the quiet courage of the overlooked to spur leaders toward righteousness and to pour out blessing on the land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun -
