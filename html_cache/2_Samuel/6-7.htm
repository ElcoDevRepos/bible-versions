The Ark of the Covenant was a symbol of God's presence and holiness. In <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>, God commanded that only the Levites, specifically the Kohathites, were to carry the Ark, and they were not to touch it directly. Uzzah's action, though seemingly well-intentioned, violated these divine instructions, demonstrating a lack of reverence for God's holiness. This incident underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences of disregarding them.<p><b>and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence</b><br>The immediate judgment upon Uzzah serves as a stark reminder of God's holiness and justice. The term "irreverence" indicates a failure to respect the sanctity of the Ark. This event parallels other instances in Scripture where God's holiness is emphasized, such as the deaths of Nadab and Abihu in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, who offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. It illustrates that God's presence demands reverence and that His instructions are not to be taken lightly.<p><b>and he died there beside the ark of God</b><br>Uzzah's death beside the Ark signifies the gravity of his transgression. The Ark, representing God's covenant and presence, was central to Israel's worship and identity. This event occurred during King David's attempt to bring the Ark to Jerusalem, a significant moment in Israel's history. The location of Uzzah's death, beside the Ark, serves as a poignant reminder of the need for holiness and reverence in approaching God. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity, embodying both reverence and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A man who was struck down by God for touching the Ark of the Covenant.

The episode teaches that reverence is expressed through precise obedience, that God&#8217;s standards do not bend to circumstance, and that His presence brings either blessing or judgment depending on our response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">For his error.</span>--The original is hero very obscure: <a href="/1_chronicles/13-10.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.">1Chronicles 13:10</a> has "because he put his hand to the ark." (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19</a>.) Especial sacredness was by the law attached to the ark, and it was strictly commanded, that when it was to be moved it should be first covered by the priests, and then borne by the Levites by means of its staves; but until it was covered, the Levites might not look upon it, and might not touch it, upon pain of death (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm" title="And when the camp sets forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of testimony with it:">Numbers 4:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm" title="And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/4-19.htm" title="But thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:">Numbers 4:19-20</a>). Uzzah was probably a Levite, or, at any rate, had been so long in the house with the ark that he ought to have made himself familiar with the law in regard to it. What may seem, at first thought, an exceeding severe penalty for a well-meaning, though unlawful act, is seen on reflection to have been a very necessary manifestation of the Divine displeasure; for this act involved not only a violation of the letter of the law (of which David also was guilty), but a want of reverence for the majesty of God as symbolised by the ark, and showed a disposition to profane familiarity with sacred things. "Uzzah was a type of all who, with good intentions, humanly speaking, yet with unsanctified minds, interfere in the affairs of the kingdom of God, from the notion that they are in danger, and with the hope of saving them" (O. von Gerlach). Judgments of this kind were, however, temporal, and give in themselves no indication of the treatment of the offender beyond the grave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Error</span>.
