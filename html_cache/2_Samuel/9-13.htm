This location signifies a place of honor and protection under King David's reign. Jerusalem, known as the City of David, was the capital established by David, symbolizing unity and God's covenant with Israel. Mephibosheth's presence there reflects David's commitment to his covenant with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>), showcasing the king's loyalty and mercy.<p><b>because he always ate at the king&#8217;s table</b><br>Eating at the king's table was a privilege reserved for those in the king's favor, signifying acceptance, provision, and status. This act of kindness by David fulfills his promise to Jonathan and demonstrates the king's grace and generosity. It also prefigures the Messianic banquet, where believers are invited to dine with Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). This gesture highlights the theme of covenant faithfulness and the restoration of honor to Mephibosheth despite his grandfather Saul's enmity with David.<p><b>and he was lame in both feet</b><br>Mephibosheth's physical condition is a reminder of his vulnerability and dependence. His lameness resulted from an accident during his childhood (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), symbolizing human frailty and the consequences of a fallen world. Despite his disability, David's acceptance of Mephibosheth at his table illustrates God's grace, which is extended to all, regardless of their weaknesses or past. This mirrors the Christian belief in spiritual restoration and inclusion in God's family, regardless of one's condition or background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

Despite Mephibosheth's potential threat to the throne, David honors his covenant with Jonathan and extends kindness. This reflects God's grace towards us, not based on our merit but on His love and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusion_and_acceptance.htm">Inclusion and Acceptance</a></b><br>Mephibosheth's place at the king's table symbolizes acceptance and inclusion. In Christ, we are invited to God's table, regardless of our past or our "lameness."<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>David's actions were motivated by his covenant with Jonathan.
