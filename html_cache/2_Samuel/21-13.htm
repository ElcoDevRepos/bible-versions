This act of retrieving their bones signifies honoring the former king and his son, who was also David's close friend. The retrieval from Jabesh-gilead, where the bodies were initially taken by the valiant men of Jabesh after Saul and Jonathan's death in battle, underscores the loyalty and bravery of these men. This act also fulfills a cultural and religious duty to ensure proper burial, which was significant in ancient Israelite society. The respect for the dead and the importance of burial are themes seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>, where Joseph makes the Israelites swear to carry his bones out of Egypt.<p><b>and they also gathered the bones of those who had been hanged</b><br>This refers to the seven descendants of Saul who were executed by the Gibeonites as a form of atonement for Saul's breach of Israel's covenant with them. The hanging of these men was a public display of justice and retribution, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. By gathering their bones, David is ensuring that they too receive a proper burial, which aligns with Deuteronomic law that dictates the removal of bodies from public display by evening (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>). This act of gathering and burying the bones can be seen as a move towards reconciliation and healing for the nation, as it seeks to restore God's favor by addressing past wrongs. The theme of atonement and reconciliation is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is seen as the ultimate act of atonement for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, who seeks to honor the deceased Saul and Jonathan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first King of Israel, whose reign ended in tragedy and whose remains are being honored posthumously.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, known for his loyalty and covenant with David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group who had a covenant with Israel, whose grievances led to the exposure of the bones.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>The place from which David retrieved the bones of Saul and Jonathan, showing respect and closure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_dead.htm">Respect for the Dead</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate the importance of honoring those who have passed, reflecting a biblical principle of respect and dignity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_loyalty.htm">Covenant Loyalty</a></b><br>David's retrieval of Jonathan's bones underscores the value of keeping promises and honoring relationships, even after death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation_and_justice.htm">Reconciliation and Justice</a></b><br>The act of gathering the bones can be seen as a step towards reconciliation and justice, addressing past grievances and restoring honor.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>David's initiative in this matter shows the role of a leader in addressing unresolved issues and setting a moral example.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_remembrance.htm">Legacy and Remembrance</a></b><br>The passage encourages reflection on how we remember and honor those who have gone before us, impacting our own legacy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_21_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 21:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_21_13_David_s_respect_for_Saul.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:13 demonstrate David's respect for Saul and Jonathan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/David_s_action_honoring_commitments.htm">What does David's action in 2 Samuel 21:13 teach about honoring commitments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_the_dead_like_David.htm">How can we apply David's example of honoring the dead in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_2_Sam_21_13_to_honoring_parents.htm">What scriptural connections exist between 2 Samuel 21:13 and honoring one's parents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/David_s_bone_retrieval_leadership.htm">How does David's retrieval of bones reflect on his leadership qualities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_collect_Saul_s_bones_2.htm">Why did David retrieve the bones of Saul and Jonathan in 2 Samuel 21:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_reburial_important_in_2_Sam_21_13.htm">What is the significance of reburial in 2 Samuel 21:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_21_13_David_s_character.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:13 reflect on David's character and leadership?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/ark_to_jerusalem__before_or_after_philistines.htm">When did David bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem?
