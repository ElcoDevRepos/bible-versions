His message of "All is well" was intended to bring peace and assurance to King David. In the context of ancient Israel, messengers often brought news of victory or defeat from the battlefield. The phrase "All is well" signifies a positive outcome, reflecting the cultural importance of messengers in delivering crucial news. This moment is reminiscent of the role of messengers in other biblical narratives, such as the announcement of victory in <a href="/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a>.<p><b>And he bowed facedown before the king.</b><br>Bowing facedown was a common act of respect and submission in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It demonstrated humility and recognition of the king's authority. This act by Ahimaaz underscores the hierarchical social structure of the time, where the king was seen as God's appointed ruler. The gesture also reflects the biblical principle of honoring those in authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>.<p><b>He continued, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD your God!</b><br>Ahimaaz attributes the victory to the LORD, acknowledging God's sovereignty and intervention in the affairs of Israel. This reflects the biblical theme of divine providence, where God is seen as the ultimate source of deliverance and blessing. The phrase "Blessed be the LORD" is a common expression of praise found throughout the Psalms and other scriptures, emphasizing the importance of giving glory to God for successes and victories.<p><b>He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "delivered up" indicates God's active role in ensuring David's triumph over his enemies. The men who "raised their hands" against David were those who supported Absalom's rebellion. This highlights the biblical theme of God's justice and protection of His anointed ones, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48-50</a>. The deliverance of David can also be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate victory of Jesus over His enemies, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>The son of Zadok the priest, Ahimaaz was a swift runner and a loyal messenger for King David.
