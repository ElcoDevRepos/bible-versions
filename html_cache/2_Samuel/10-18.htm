Their flight signifies a decisive victory for Israel, showcasing God's favor upon David's leadership. This event is part of a series of military campaigns where David consolidates his kingdom, fulfilling God's promise to establish Israel as a dominant nation (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>). The Arameans' retreat highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel, where He promised to give them victory over their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p><b>and David killed seven hundred charioteers</b><br>Chariots were a formidable military asset in ancient warfare, often determining the outcome of battles. The destruction of seven hundred charioteers indicates a significant blow to the Aramean military capabilities. This victory underscores David's strategic prowess and God's providence in granting Israel success. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, suggesting a total victory.<p><b>and forty thousand foot soldiers</b><br>The large number of foot soldiers killed emphasizes the scale of the battle and the magnitude of Israel's triumph. This victory further establishes David's reputation as a warrior king and consolidates his rule over Israel. The defeat of such a vast army demonstrates God's power working through David, reminiscent of other biblical victories where God intervenes on behalf of His people (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>).<p><b>He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, who died there</b><br>Shobach's death signifies the complete dismantling of the Aramean military leadership, ensuring that the threat from this coalition is neutralized. The defeat of a commander often leads to the disarray and demoralization of the troops, contributing to the comprehensive nature of Israel's victory. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where the defeat of enemy leaders leads to the collapse of their forces (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21-22</a>).

It is impossible to reconcile these conflicting numbers, but as David had no cavalry, the numbers in <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> are the more probable, namely, seventeen hundred cavalry and chariots, and twenty thousand infantry.
