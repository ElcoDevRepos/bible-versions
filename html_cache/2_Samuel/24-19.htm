Despite his previous sin of conducting a census, David demonstrates repentance by following God's directive. This act of going up is significant, as it often symbolizes moving towards God or a place of worship. In biblical narratives, "going up" frequently indicates a journey to a higher spiritual or physical place, such as Jerusalem or a mountain where God is worshiped.<p><b>at the word of Gad</b><br>Gad was a prophet during David's reign, serving as a divine messenger. Prophets in Israel were crucial for conveying God's will to the king and the people. Gad's role here underscores the importance of prophetic guidance in the life of Israel's leaders. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God communicating through chosen individuals, as seen with other prophets like Samuel and Nathan.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority of God's command and the necessity of obedience to His will. It reflects the biblical principle that true worship and service to God require adherence to His instructions. The LORD's command here is a direct response to David's earlier disobedience, showing God's mercy in providing a way for atonement. This obedience is a precursor to the establishment of the altar on the threshing floor of Araunah, which later becomes the site of Solomon's Temple, a central place of worship for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, who is responding to God's command through the prophet Gad.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord who delivers God's message to David.
