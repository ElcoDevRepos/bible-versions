They had made a treaty with Israel during the time of Joshua by deceiving the Israelites into believing they were from a distant land (Joshua 9). This treaty was sworn in the name of the Lord, making it binding. The context of this passage is a famine during King David's reign, which was revealed to be a result of Saul's breach of this treaty by attempting to annihilate the Gibeonites. This highlights the importance of covenant faithfulness in the biblical narrative.<p><b>&#8220;We need no silver or gold from Saul or his house&#8221;</b><br>The Gibeonites' refusal of monetary compensation underscores the gravity of Saul's offense against them. In ancient Near Eastern culture, blood vengeance and retributive justice were common, and financial compensation was often used to settle disputes. However, the Gibeonites sought justice rather than material gain, indicating the depth of their grievance and the inadequacy of wealth to atone for Saul's actions.<p><b>nor should you put to death anyone in Israel for us.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the Gibeonites' desire for justice specifically directed at Saul's house rather than indiscriminate vengeance against the Israelites. It also shows a measure of restraint and a focus on rectifying the specific wrongs committed by Saul. This aligns with the biblical principle of individual responsibility for sin, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where it is stated that the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father.<p><b>&#8220;Whatever you ask, I will do for you,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>David's response demonstrates his commitment to justice and his role as a mediator between the Gibeonites and Israel. It reflects his desire to restore the nation's relationship with God by addressing the cause of the famine. This willingness to fulfill the Gibeonites' request can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills the demands of justice on behalf of humanity. David's role here prefigures the ultimate reconciliation brought by Jesus, who satisfies divine justice and restores peace between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people who lived in the land of Canaan.

David appreciates the fairness of their view of the matter, and promises beforehand to do whatever they shall require.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No silver nor gold.</span> It is a common practice in most semi-civilized nations for a fine to be accepted as compensation for the shedding of blood. As no distinction was drawn between murder and homicide, and as the nearest relative was bound in every case to revenge the blood shed, the custom of receiving a money compensation gradually grew up to prevent the tribe or nation being torn to pieces by interminable revenge. The Arabs still retain this usage, but it was forbidden by the Levitical Law (<a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>), and rightly so, because a distinction was there made between murder and accidental bloodshed, and precautions taken for the rescue of one who had not acted with malice. <span class="cmt_word">Neither for us shalt thou kill any turn in Israel.</span> The singular is used at the beginning of their answer, in the same way as in <a href="/2_samuel/19-42.htm">2 Samuel 19:42, 43</a>. Literally their words are, <span class="accented">It is not to me a matter of silver and gold with Saul and his house, nor is it for us to put to death any one in Israel</span>; that is, "We refuse a money compensation, and it is beyond our power to exact the blood penalty which would gratify our anger." They make it quite plain that they do want blood, while the Authorized Version makes them say that they do not. The Revised Version more correctly translates, "Neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Gibeonites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;gi&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
