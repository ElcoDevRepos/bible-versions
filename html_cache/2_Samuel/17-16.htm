In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/17.htm">2 Samuel 17</a>, Ahithophel's counsel to Absalom posed a significant threat to David. The urgency reflects the imminent danger David faced. The use of messengers in ancient times was crucial for communication, especially in times of war or political intrigue. This reflects the importance of swift communication in the preservation of David's life and kingship.<p><b>&#8216;Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness</b><br>The "fords of the wilderness" refers to shallow parts of a river where it can be crossed. In this context, it likely refers to the Jordan River, a significant geographical feature in Israel. The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing or danger in the Bible, as seen in the Israelites' wanderings and Jesus' temptation. The advice not to spend the night there underscores the vulnerability of David and his followers in such a location, where they could be easily ambushed.<p><b>but be sure to cross over</b><br>Crossing over the Jordan River would provide a strategic advantage, offering a natural barrier against Absalom's forces. This action is reminiscent of the Israelites crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land under Joshua, symbolizing a transition to safety and divine provision. It also reflects the need for decisive action in the face of danger, a recurring theme in David's life.<p><b>Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up</b><br>The phrase "swallowed up" conveys the total destruction that awaited David and his followers if they did not heed the warning. This imagery is reminiscent of the earth swallowing Korah and his followers in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, symbolizing divine judgment. The reference to "the king" emphasizes David's legitimate rule, despite Absalom's rebellion. This highlights the covenantal promise God made to David, ensuring the continuation of his lineage, which ultimately points to the messianic prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, currently in a precarious situation due to Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has usurped the throne and is seeking to solidify his power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai.htm">Hushai</a></b><br>David's loyal friend and spy, who provides counsel to Absalom to thwart Ahithophel's advice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A former counselor of David, now advising Absalom, known for his wise counsel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fords_of_the_wilderness.htm">The Fords of the Wilderness</a></b><br>A strategic location where David and his followers are vulnerable to attack.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>Despite human schemes, God's purposes prevail.

Hushai knows Absalom&#8217;s forces could move at any moment, so he presses Jonathan and Ahimaaz to act without delay (<a href="/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs faith with swift obedience&#8212;think of Joseph fleeing to Egypt the very night he was warned (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13&#8211;14</a>) or David himself escaping Saul at once when warned by Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-35.htm">1 Samuel 20:35&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence supplies the warning, yet human agents must move; &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell David</b><p>&#8226; The king is God&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).

Hushai&#8217;s message passes through multiple servants, mirroring how the Church safeguards and relays the gospel (2 <a href="/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The Jordan fords look defensible, yet lingering there would expose the weary fugitives to a night assault (<a href="/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>; <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; What seems a safe stop can prove deadly; Lot hesitated in Sodom and nearly perished (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15&#8211;17</a>). God&#8217;s wisdom often tells us to move past our comfort zones before danger closes in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but be sure to cross over</b><p>&#8226; Crossing the Jordan places David on the eastern side, buying time and space (<a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>).<p>&#8226; The command echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier crossing under Joshua (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3&#8211;4</a>). There, stepping into the water signified trust; here, David must likewise act in faith that God is still with him despite exile.<p>&#8226; Obedience sometimes involves decisive, even risky steps&#8212;Peter had to get out of the boat to walk on water (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Otherwise the king and all the people with him</b><p>&#8226; Hushai&#8217;s warning stresses corporate consequence.
