Nathan, a prophet, is sent by God to confront King David. This reflects the role of prophets in Israel as God's messengers, often tasked with delivering difficult truths. Nathan's mission underscores the seriousness of David's sin with Bathsheba and Uriah, as recorded in the previous chapter. Prophets like Nathan were crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel, often calling leaders and the people back to righteousness.<p><b>and when he arrived, he said</b><br>Nathan's arrival signifies the beginning of a divine confrontation. The use of a parable to address David is strategic, allowing David to judge the situation objectively before realizing his own guilt. This method is reminiscent of Jesus' use of parables in the New Testament to reveal deeper truths and convict the heart. Nathan's approach is both wise and compassionate, aiming to lead David to repentance rather than immediate condemnation.<p><b>&#8220;There were two men in a certain city</b><br>The introduction of two men in a parable sets the stage for a moral lesson. The "certain city" is unspecified, making the story universally applicable. This narrative technique draws the listener into the story, encouraging them to focus on the moral implications rather than the specifics of location or identity. The use of parables is a common biblical method to convey spiritual truths, as seen in the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>one rich and the other poor</b><br>The contrast between the rich and poor man is central to the parable's message. This dichotomy highlights issues of justice, power, and exploitation, themes prevalent throughout the Bible. The rich man's abundance and the poor man's lack serve as a metaphor for David's actions against Uriah, where David, despite having much, took the little that Uriah had. This mirrors the biblical principle that those with power have a responsibility to act justly and protect the vulnerable, as seen in laws and teachings throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who initiates the confrontation of David's sin by sending Nathan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet of God who serves as His messenger, tasked with delivering a message of conviction to King David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who has sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrating the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_certain_city.htm">A Certain City</a></b><br>The unspecified location in Nathan's parable, representing the setting for the moral lesson he is about to deliver.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_men.htm">Two Men</a></b><br>Characters in Nathan's parable, symbolizing the disparity between David (the rich man) and Uriah (the poor man).<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_messengers.htm">The Role of Prophets and Messengers</a></b><br>God uses individuals to deliver His messages, often calling them to confront sin with courage and wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_accountability.htm">The Importance of Accountability</a></b><br>Nathan's confrontation of David underscores the necessity of accountability in the life of believers, especially leaders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_pursuit_of_repentance.htm">God's Pursuit of Repentance</a></b><br>God's sending of Nathan demonstrates His desire for repentance and restoration rather than punishment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_parables.htm">The Power of Parables</a></b><br>Nathan's use of a parable to reveal David's sin shows the effectiveness of accounttelling in conveying truth and prompting self-reflection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_conviction.htm">Responding to Conviction</a></b><br>David's eventual repentance highlights the appropriate response to being confronted with one's sin&#8212;humility and a plea for forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_12_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 12:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nathan_s_approach_in_confronting_sin.htm">How does Nathan's approach in 2 Samuel 12:1 guide us in confronting sin?
