His betrayal by siding with Absalom is significant, as it reflects the deep political and personal turmoil within David's reign. Ahithophel's advice was highly regarded, almost as if one were consulting the word of God (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Sleep with your father&#8217;s concubines</b><br>This advice was not only a political move but also a deeply personal affront to King David. In the ancient Near Eastern context, taking possession of a king's concubines was a declaration of taking over his throne and authority. This act would publicly humiliate David and assert Absalom's claim to kingship. It echoes Nathan's prophecy to David after his sin with Bathsheba, where God declared that David's own household would rise against him (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>).<p><b>whom he has left to take care of the palace.</b><br>David left ten concubines to manage the palace when he fled Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/15-16.htm">2 Samuel 15:16</a>). This decision reflects the trust and responsibility placed upon them, as well as the vulnerability of those left behind during political upheaval. The concubines' role was both domestic and symbolic, representing the king's household and authority.<p><b>When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father,</b><br>The phrase "become a stench" indicates a complete breakdown in the relationship between Absalom and David. It suggests a public scandal that would turn the people against David and solidify Absalom's rebellion. This act was meant to demonstrate Absalom's resolve and irreversibility in his conflict with David, making reconciliation impossible.<p><b>then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.&#8221;</b><br>Ahithophel's strategy was to embolden Absalom's followers by showing decisive action against David. In ancient warfare and politics, morale was crucial, and a bold move like this would rally Absalom's supporters. It was intended to consolidate Absalom's power and encourage those who were hesitant to fully commit to his cause. This reflects the broader theme of loyalty and betrayal that runs throughout the narrative of David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to King David, known for his wisdom.

The counsel fulfills Nathan&#8217;s prophecy, displays the devastating ripple effects of David&#8217;s earlier sin, and illustrates how human schemes, even when politically astute, cannot overturn God&#8217;s sovereign purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And Ahithophel said.</span>--The counsel of Ahithophel was in effect that Absalom should make the breach between him and his father absolute and irreconcilable. His followers would thus be assured of the impossibility of his securing a pardon for himself while they were left to their fate. After adopting this course, he must necessarily persist to the end. The taking of the harem of his predecessor by the incoming monarch was an Oriental custom, to the enormity of which the mind was blunted by the practice of polygamy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahithophel said.</span> Ahithophel's counsel was utterly abominable, even though the deed would not be regarded by any of the Israelites as incestuous. A king inherited his predecessor's harem, and Absalom's act was a coarse and rude assertion that David's rights were at an end, and that crown and lands and property, even to his wives, now all belonged to the usurper. But, while polygamy had thus degraded the wives and concubines into mere chattels, the harem was the property most jealously guarded by its owner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>); and Absalom's act was an outrage which David could never have pardoned. And this was what Ahithophel wanted. He was afraid that if Absalom's cause began to decline, he might come to terms with his father, who would readily forgive a son if he submitted, but would certainly punish Ahithophel. For his own selfish purposes, therefore, he led Absalom on to a crime which rendered a reconciliation with David impossible, and pledged all the conspirators to carry out the matter to the bitter end; and that end could only be the death of David if the conspiracy succeeded. But this bitterness to David would vex all moderate men, and weaken Absalom's cause. It was of advantage only to such as were deeply committed to the rebellion, and bent on killing David. To him it was terrible sorrow; for he knew that this open shame was the punishment of his own secret infamy (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11, 12</a>); and in it, again, he saw the meshes of the avenger's net tightening around him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ahithophel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1465;&#1433;&#1508;&#1462;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;p&#772;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_302.htm">Strong's 302: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahithophel -- an adviser of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
