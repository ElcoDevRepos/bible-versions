The people urging David to eat reflects the cultural practice of providing food to those in mourning, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>. This act of communal support highlights the unity and respect the people had for David, recognizing his leadership and grief. The phrase "while it was still day" indicates the urgency and immediacy of their concern, as eating during daylight was customary.<p><b>but David took an oath, saying,</b><br>David's response by taking an oath demonstrates his deep sincerity and commitment to his mourning. Oaths were serious declarations in ancient Israel, often invoking God's name as a witness to one's promise, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>. This reflects David's integrity and his desire to honor Abner's memory fully.<p><b>&#8220;May God punish me, and ever so severely,</b><br>This phrase is a common form of oath in the Old Testament, emphasizing the seriousness of the vow. It reflects the belief in divine retribution for breaking an oath, as seen in <a href="/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>. David's invocation of God's punishment underscores his earnestness and the gravity of his commitment to mourning.<p><b>if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!&#8221;</b><br>David's refusal to eat until sunset signifies his deep mourning and respect for Abner. Fasting was a common expression of grief and penitence in biblical times, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>. The mention of "before the sun sets" aligns with the Jewish understanding of a day, which begins and ends at sunset, highlighting the completeness of his mourning period. This act of fasting can also be seen as a type of Christ, who fasted and showed deep compassion and empathy for others' suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his leadership qualities.

Oaths were solemn, calling God as witness (<a href="/1_samuel/24-21.htm">1 Samuel 24:21&#8211;22</a>); David&#8217;s word had to match his actions (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p>&#8226;

While, then, others were partaking of the food that had been provided, David remained apart, and when urged by the assembled multitude to join them in their meal, he protested that he would continue fasting until sunset.
