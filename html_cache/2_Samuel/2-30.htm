This pursuit followed a battle at Gibeon, a significant location in the tribal territory of Benjamin. The pursuit highlights the ongoing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David, a central theme in the early chapters of 2 Samuel. Joab's return signifies a temporary cessation of hostilities, reflecting the complex and often personal nature of these conflicts. The pursuit of Abner also foreshadows future tensions between Joab and Abner, which will have significant implications for the kingdom of Israel.<p><b>he gathered all the troops</b><br>Joab's action of gathering the troops indicates a moment of regrouping and assessment after the battle. This reflects the military practices of the time, where commanders would take stock of their forces to evaluate losses and plan future actions. The gathering of troops also underscores Joab's leadership and organizational skills, which were crucial for David's military successes. This moment of gathering can be seen as a precursor to the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule, as it demonstrates the consolidation of his forces.<p><b>In addition to Asahel</b><br>Asahel, Joab's brother, was known for his swiftness and was one of David's mighty men. His pursuit of Abner during the battle led to his death, a pivotal event that fueled the ongoing feud between Joab and Abner. Asahel's death is significant as it sets the stage for future acts of vengeance and highlights the personal nature of the conflicts within the narrative. Asahel's role and his untimely death also serve as a reminder of the cost of war and the personal losses experienced by those involved.<p><b>nineteen of David&#8217;s servants were missing</b><br>The mention of nineteen missing servants of David provides insight into the casualties of the battle. This number, while relatively small, indicates the losses suffered by David's forces and serves as a contrast to the greater losses experienced by Abner's troops. The term "servants" reflects the loyalty and dedication of those who served David, emphasizing the personal bonds and commitments within his army. This detail also highlights the human cost of the struggle for power and the sacrifices made by those who supported David's claim to the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army and a key military leader.

Abner had killed Asahel (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>), so the pursuit involved justice for a fallen brother as well as the defense of David&#8217;s kingdom.<p>&#8226; Scripture shows leaders pursuing enemies until God&#8217;s purpose is fulfilled (<a href="/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>; <a href="/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23</a>). Joab&#8217;s return signals that the chase had ended when it no longer served God&#8217;s immediate plan&#8212;Abner&#8217;s plea and the nightfall had halted further bloodshed (<a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming back from conflict, Joab models disciplined obedience. He does not linger in vengeance; he returns to camp, reflecting <a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>: &#8220;Do not say, &#8216;I will avenge this evil!&#8217; Wait on the LORD, and He will save you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he gathered all the troops</b><p>&#8226; Good commanders account for every soldier (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2&#8211;3</a>). Joab&#8217;s first act is to muster the men, demonstrating stewardship over lives entrusted to him.<p>&#8226; Gathering also restores unity after the heat of battle. <a href="/hebrews/12-12.htm">Hebrews 12:12&#8211;13</a> urges believers to &#8220;strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.&#8221; Joab&#8217;s regrouping lets wounded hearts and bodies be cared for.<p>&#8226; This shepherd-like concern foreshadows David&#8217;s later shepherd leadership (<a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>). God values both victory and the wellbeing of His people (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12</a>, where Jesus has the leftovers gathered so none are lost).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to Asahel</b><p>&#8226; Scripture singles out Asahel because relationships matter to God. Names are not mere statistics (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, &#8220;He calls His own sheep by name&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Asahel&#8217;s death was a turning point (<a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18&#8211;23</a>). Mentioning him here underscores that personal loss accompanies national struggle.<p>&#8226; His mention also reminds the reader that even the swift (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>) fall without divine protection, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nineteen of David&#8217;s servants were missing</b><p>&#8226; The tally shows God&#8217;s restrained judgment. Compared to Abner&#8217;s losses of 360 (<a href="/2_samuel/2-31.htm">2 Samuel 2:31</a>), Israel&#8217;s casualties are minimal, reflecting divine favor on David&#8217;s house (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Counting the missing teaches realism: victory still carries cost (<a href="/luke/14-31.htm">Luke 14:31&#8211;32</a>). Faithful service may involve sacrifice, yet God records every loss (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The number nineteen, though small, represents families affected. <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a> calls believers to &#8220;weep with those who weep,&#8221; encouraging compassion toward the bereaved.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joab&#8217;s return, his gathering of troops, the naming of Asahel, and the careful count of nineteen missing men together paint a portrait of godly leadership under David. The verse reminds us that in every conflict God values justice tempered with restraint, leadership that accounts for people, personal names amid statistics, and honest recognition of sacrifice. Even in triumph, Scripture calls believers to stewardship, compassion, and trust in the Lord&#8217;s sovereign protection and purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Joab returned.</span>--He cannot be supposed to have returned that day farther than to Gibeon, since it was already sunset (<a href="/2_samuel/2-24.htm" title="Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.">2Samuel 2:24</a>) before the pursuit ended. There, doubtless, he mustered his forces, and counted and buried the slain.<p><span class= "bld">Nineteen men.</span>--It is uncertain whether these numbers include the twelve champion combatants on each side. The great disparity of numbers slain on the two sides is to be accounted for partly by the advantage given by bow and spear, the chief weapons of ancient warfare, to the pursuer over the pursued, and partly by the fact that Joab's men had been long trained under David in hardship and deeds of valour, while Abner's men were the remnants of Saul's defeated army.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nineteen men... three hundred and three score men.</span> Though David's "mighties," as they were called, excelled in the use of arms, yet the disparity of numbers is remarkable; for the Benjamites were also famous warriors. We can only account for it by the superiority of the tactics of Joab, who was a man of consummate military skill, and who knew both how to gain a victory and how to use the advantage which the pursuers have over the pursued to the full. If we sometimes wonder that David endured Joab so long, we ought to remember how much he owed to his nephew's genius, and that Joab was always faithful to himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
