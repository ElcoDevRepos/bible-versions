The two-year gap suggests a period of unresolved tension and bitterness, particularly for Absalom, Tamar's full brother, who has been harboring a desire for revenge. This delay in action reflects the cultural and familial complexities of ancient Israel, where family honor and retribution were deeply intertwined.<p><b>when Absalom&#8217;s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor</b><br>Sheepshearing was a time of festivity and celebration in ancient Israel, often accompanied by feasting and social gatherings. Baal-hazor, identified with a location near Ephraim, was likely a significant site for such activities. The mention of sheepshearers indicates a prosperous time for Absalom, as sheepshearing was associated with wealth and productivity. This setting provides a backdrop for Absalom's calculated plan, as the festive atmosphere would naturally draw many attendees, including the king's sons.<p><b>near Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim was a region in the central hill country of Israel, known for its fertile land and strategic location. The mention of Ephraim situates the narrative geographically, highlighting the distance from Jerusalem and the potential for Absalom to act with a degree of autonomy away from the immediate oversight of King David. This location also connects to the broader tribal dynamics within Israel, as Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes.<p><b>he invited all the sons of the king</b><br>Absalom's invitation to all the king's sons was a strategic move, designed to ensure the presence of Amnon, whom he intended to kill in revenge for Tamar's disgrace. This invitation underlines the familial ties and obligations that would compel the king's sons to attend such an event. It also reflects the cultural expectation of hospitality and the importance of family gatherings in maintaining social and political alliances. The invitation sets the stage for the unfolding of Absalom's plan, which would have significant repercussions for David's family and kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.

Absalom&#8217;s silence hid a slow-boiling plan for revenge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Absalom&#8217;s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim</b><p>&#8226; Sheepshearing was a festive season marked by abundance and celebration (<a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2&#8211;8</a> with Nabal; <a href="/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12&#8211;13</a> with Judah).<p>&#8226; By choosing Baal-hazor&#8212;about fifteen miles north of Jerusalem&#8212;Absalom kept the gathering outside the immediate oversight of David&#8217;s court, echoing Joab&#8217;s use of a private setting to strike Abner unawares (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The joyous backdrop of a sheepshearing feast masked Absalom&#8217;s murderous intent, paralleling <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24&#8211;26</a>, which describes how malice can be concealed beneath cheerful words.<p>&#8226; The location in Ephraim&#8217;s vicinity evokes earlier tribal conflicts (<a href="/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1&#8211;6</a>) and hints at Absalom&#8217;s broader ambitions to win support beyond Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He invited all the sons of the king</b><p>&#8226; Extending the invitation to &#8220;all the sons of the king&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a> c) created a fa&#231;ade of family unity while isolating the target, Amnon.<p>&#8226; The tactic mirrors Cain&#8217;s call to Abel, &#8220;Let us go out to the field&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>), and Joab&#8217;s private conversation with Amasa before killing him (<a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; These princes represented potential claimants to the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2&#8211;5</a>), so gathering them under his roof also showcased Absalom&#8217;s wealth and influence, foreshadowing his later bid for kingship (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s eventual reluctance to attend (<a href="/2_samuel/13-24.htm">2 Samuel 13:24&#8211;25</a>) left the sons without paternal protection, illustrating how passivity can expose others to harm (cf. <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a> marks the turning point where Absalom&#8217;s long-nursed hatred moves into action. The two-year delay reveals calculated vengeance; the festive sheepshearing at remote Baal-hazor provides cover; inviting every royal son creates the perfect stage for Amnon&#8217;s assassination and displays Absalom&#8217;s rising power. The verse warns that unresolved sin, unchecked by righteous leadership, gives bitterness time to mature into deadly schemes, and it highlights how evil often cloaks itself in ordinary celebrations and polite invitations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Absalom had sheepshearers.</span>--Absalom had now silently nourished his revenge for "two full years." No doubt he chose also to give full opportunity for his father to punish Amnon's iniquity if he would; and by this long quiet waiting he so far disarmed suspicion that he was able to carry out his purpose. Sheepshearing always was, and still is, a time of feasting. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm" title="And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.">1Samuel 25:2</a>.)
