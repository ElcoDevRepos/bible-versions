These men were renowned for their bravery and skill in battle, serving as David's most trusted and valiant soldiers. The concept of mighty men is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern tradition of warrior elites who were celebrated for their heroic deeds. In the broader biblical narrative, these men symbolize the strength and support that God provided to David, enabling him to establish and secure his kingdom.<p><b>Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite:</b><br>Josheb-basshebeth is identified as one of the foremost warriors among David's mighty men. The name "Josheb-basshebeth" is somewhat enigmatic, with variations in different manuscripts, but it is generally understood to refer to a distinguished warrior. The term "Tahchemonite" likely indicates his origin or clan, though its exact meaning is uncertain. This designation highlights the diverse backgrounds of David's warriors, who were united under his leadership.<p><b>was chief of the Three:</b><br>Josheb-basshebeth is described as the chief of the Three, a subgroup within the mighty men. The Three were the most elite and accomplished warriors, distinguished by their extraordinary feats. This hierarchical structure within the mighty men reflects the organization and discipline of David's forces, which were crucial for his military successes. The Three's exploits are celebrated in the biblical text, underscoring their pivotal role in David's reign.<p><b>He wielded his spear against eight hundred men:</b><br>This phrase recounts a remarkable feat of valor, where Josheb-basshebeth is said to have fought against eight hundred men with his spear. Such accounts of individual heroism are common in ancient military narratives, serving to inspire and exemplify the ideal warrior. The number "eight hundred" may be symbolic, representing overwhelming odds and the divine empowerment of David's warriors. This act of bravery is reminiscent of other biblical figures who achieved great victories through faith and divine assistance.<p><b>whom he killed at one time:</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the extraordinary nature of Josheb-basshebeth's achievement, suggesting a single, decisive battle or engagement. This account highlights the supernatural strength and courage attributed to David's mighty men, often seen as a reflection of God's favor and intervention. The narrative serves to glorify the accomplishments of these warriors while reinforcing the theme of divine support for David's kingdom. Such stories of individual heroism also prefigure the ultimate victory of Christ, who triumphs over sin and death through His sacrificial act.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his leadership, military prowess, and heart for God.

Josheb-basshebeth led this inner circle, much like Peter, James, and John formed Jesus&#8217; closest circle (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>; 9:2).<p>&#8226; Leadership here is based on proven faithfulness in battle, not lineage or politics (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>).<p>&#8226; God often raises one servant to inspire others&#8212;think of Gideon&#8217;s 300 (<a href="/judges/7-17.htm">Judges 7:17</a>) or Paul among the apostles (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He wielded his spear against eight hundred men</b><p>&#8220;He wielded his spear against eight hundred men &#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The number is staggering, yet the narrative presents it as straightforward fact. Such feats fulfill promises like <a href="/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, where God said one man could chase a thousand when He fought for them.<p>&#8226; Similar single-handed victories appear with Shamgar&#8217;s 600 (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>) and Jonathan&#8217;s climb against the Philistine outpost (<a href="/1_samuel/14-12.htm">1 Samuel 14:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The spear reminds us that ordinary weapons become extraordinary when yielded by someone wholly reliant on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whom he killed at one time</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; whom he killed at one time.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores a single, decisive encounter, not a lifetime tally.

His single-handed defeat of eight hundred enemies in one encounter demonstrates God&#8217;s power working through a committed servant. The verse affirms that when God is with His people, numerical odds are irrelevant, leadership is validated by faith-driven action, and decisive victories glorify the Lord who fights for His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">These be the names.</span>--Here, in the summary at the close of David's reign, is very naturally given a list of his chief heroes. A duplicate of this list, with several variations, and with sixteen more names, is given in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/11-10.htm" title="These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.">1Chronicles 11:10-47</a>, which is useful in correcting such clerical errors as have arisen in both. The list in Chronicles is given in connection with David's becoming king over all Israel; but in both cases the list is not to be understood as belonging precisely to any definite time, but rather as a catalogue of the chief heroes who distinguished themselves at any time in the life of David.<p><span class= "bld">The Tachmonite that sat in the seat.</span>--The text of this verse has undergone several alterations, which may be corrected by the parallel passage in Chronicles. This clause should read, "Jashobeam the Hachmonite," as in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>. Jashobeam came to David at Ziklag (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.">1Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-6.htm" title="Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,">1Chronicles 12:6</a>), and afterwards became the general of the first division of the army (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-2.htm" title="Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:2</a>), being immediately followed by Dodo. One of the same family was tutor to David's sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-32.htm" title="Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:">1Chronicles 27:32</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These be the names.</span> A similar list is given in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-47</a>, with several variations, and sixteen more names. It is given there in connection with David's elevation to the throne of all Israel, and the conquest of Jerusalem. Such catalogues might possibly be revised from time to time, and new names inserted as there were vacancies caused by death. And this seems to have been the case with the list in Chronicles, which contains the names of all who were admitted during David's reign into the order of the mighties. The present is the actual list of the order as it existed on the day when David, at Hebron, was anointed king over all the twelve tribes. And we can well conceive that, on so grand an occasion, David founded this, the first order of chivalry, and gave his thirty knights, as they would be now called, their special rank and high privileges. <span class="cmt_word">The Tachmonite.</span> This verse is extremely corrupt. A man could not be a Tachmonite and an Eznite at the same time. In the Revised Version the corruption is confessed in the mildest terms, but there is something painfully ludicrous in giving Josheb-basshebeth as the man's name. The reading "Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite," in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is confirmed by <a href="/1_chronicles/12-6.htm">1 Chronicles 12:6</a>, where Jashobeam is mentioned among those who joined David at Ziklag, and by <a href="/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>, where we find him appointed commander of the first brigade of twenty-four thousand men. The error in the present text arose from the scribe's eye being misled by catching sight of <span class="accented">basshebeth</span> in the line above, it being the word translated "in the same place" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">He Adino the Eznite.</span> These unmeaning words are a corruption of the right reading preserved in Chronicles, "he lifted up his spear." The number of men whom he slew at one time is there stated as having been three hundred; but, as Abishai accomplished this feat, and yet held only inferior rank, eight hundred is probably right. And possibly it is not meant that he slew them all with his own hand, though that is quite possible. He was <span class="cmt_word">chief of the captains.</span> The word for "captain," <span class="accented">shalish</span>, is derived from the numeral "three;" and probably it was the title of the three who formed the first rank of the mighties. But in course of time it seems to have been applied to the commanders of the body guard (<a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>); and we find Bidcar so styled when in personal attendance upon Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>); and Pekah used the opportunities afforded by this office for the murder of Pekahiah (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). It is not used of military officers generally. Those admitted to the list were evidently the outlaws . who had been with David in his wanderings and at Ziklag. They now received their reward, and became, moreover, the stay of David's throne. It is their past history which accounts for the strange composition of the list. A large number came from Judah, and especially from Bethlehem. Several are David's own relatives. Seven towns or families furnish sixteen out of the whole list. We find a father and his son, and pairs of brothers. There are, moreover, numerous foreigners - Hittites, Ammonites, Moabites, a Syrian from Zobah, and Gideonites, descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of the land.
