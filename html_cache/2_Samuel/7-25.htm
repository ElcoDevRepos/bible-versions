The use of "O LORD God" reflects a deep reverence and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. In the Hebrew text, "LORD" is "Yahweh," the covenant name of God, highlighting the personal and covenantal nature of the relationship. This invocation sets the tone for a prayer of faith and trust in God's promises.<p><b>confirm forever the word You have spoken</b><br>David is asking God to establish His promise permanently. The "word" refers to the covenant God made with David, often called the Davidic Covenant, which is foundational for understanding the messianic hope in the Old Testament. This covenant is detailed earlier in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, where God promises David an everlasting dynasty. The request for confirmation "forever" underscores the eternal nature of God's promises, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the eternal King.<p><b>concerning Your servant and his house.</b><br>"Your servant" refers to David, highlighting his role as a humble servant of God despite being king. The term "house" refers not only to David's physical lineage but also to his royal dynasty. This promise of a lasting dynasty is significant in the context of Israel's history, as it assures the continuation of David's line, which is crucial for the coming of the Messiah. The concept of a "house" also connects to the idea of a spiritual house or kingdom, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ and His church.<p><b>Do as You have promised,</b><br>David's request for God to act according to His promise reflects a deep faith in God's faithfulness and reliability. This phrase is a model of prayer, showing how believers can confidently ask God to fulfill His promises. The assurance that God will do as He has promised is rooted in His unchanging nature and His covenantal faithfulness. This connects to other scriptural affirmations of God's faithfulness, such as in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> and <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>, and ultimately points to the fulfillment of God's promises in Jesus, who is the "Yes" and "Amen" of all God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God, who desires to build a house for the Lord but is instead promised an everlasting dynasty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's covenant promise to David, assuring him of a lasting dynasty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who makes a promise to David regarding his lineage and kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_house.htm">David's House</a></b><br>Refers to David's dynasty, which God promises to establish forever.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns and where the temple will eventually be built by his son Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

<a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament shows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, the Son of David, whose kingdom &#8220;will never end&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word You have spoken</b><p>&#8226;
