Mourning, weeping, and fasting were traditional expressions of grief in ancient Israelite culture, signifying a profound sense of loss and respect for the deceased. Fasting until evening indicates a full day of mourning, showing the depth of their sorrow. This practice is consistent with other biblical accounts of mourning, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>, where the people of Jabesh-gilead fasted for seven days after retrieving Saul's body. The act of fasting is also a form of humbling oneself before God, seeking His comfort and guidance in times of distress.<p><b>for Saul and his son Jonathan</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, and his son Jonathan, David's close friend, were both killed in battle against the Philistines. Despite Saul's pursuit of David, David's lamentation for Saul demonstrates his respect for Saul's anointed position as king. Jonathan's death was particularly personal for David, as their friendship was marked by a covenant of loyalty and love (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). This mourning reflects the complexity of David's relationship with Saul and Jonathan, balancing personal grief with national loss.<p><b>and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel</b><br>The phrase "people of the LORD" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were in covenant with Him. The "house of Israel" signifies the collective tribes of Israel, emphasizing the national tragedy of losing their king and prince. This mourning extends beyond personal loss to encompass the broader implications for the nation. The defeat by the Philistines was not just a military loss but also a spiritual and communal crisis, as it threatened the stability and unity of Israel.<p><b>because they had fallen by the sword</b><br>This phrase indicates the cause of death&#8212;battle against the Philistines. The defeat was a significant event, marking a moment of vulnerability for Israel. The phrase "fallen by the sword" is a common biblical expression for death in battle, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-6</a>. It underscores the reality of war and its consequences, serving as a reminder of the ongoing conflict between Israel and its enemies. This loss also foreshadows the eventual rise of David as king, as he would later unite the tribes and establish a period of relative peace and prosperity for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who deeply mourns the death of Saul and Jonathan despite Saul's pursuit to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose death marks the end of his troubled reign and the beginning of David's kingship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, known for his loyalty and covenant with David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_lord.htm">The People of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who suffered a significant loss in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, which is in mourning due to the defeat and loss of their leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_grief.htm">The Depth of Grief</a></b><br>David's mourning shows that grief is a natural and profound response to loss, even when the deceased was an adversary.

Although David thus heard of the death of his persistent and mortal enemy, and of his own consequent accession to the throne, yet there is not the slightest reason to doubt the reality and earnestness of his mourning. The whole narrative shows that David not only, as a patriotic Israelite, lamented the death of the king, but also felt a personal attachment to Saul, notwithstanding his long and unreasonable hostility. But Saul did not die alone; Jonathan, David's most cherished friend, fell with him. At the same time, the whole nation over which David was hereafter to reign received a crushing defeat from their foes, and large numbers of his countrymen were slain. It has been well remarked that the only deep mourning for Saul, with the exception of the men of Jabesh-gilead, came from the man whom he had hated and persecuted as long as he lived.<p><span class= "bld">The people of the Lord.</span>--Besides his personal grief, David had both a religious and a patriotic ground for sorrow. The men who had fallen were parts of that Church of God which he so earnestly loved and served, and were also members of the commonwealth of Israel, on whose behalf he ever laboured with patriotic devotion. The LXX., overlooking this distinction, has very unnecessarily changed "people of the Lord" into "people of Judah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They mourned, and wept, and fasted.</span> The sight of Saul's royal insignia was clear proof of Israel's disaster; and this sorrow of David and his men shows how true their hearts were to their country, and how unbearable would have been their position had not the prudence of the Philistine lords extricated them from the difficulty in which they had been placed by David's want of faith. But David had other reasons besides patriotism for sorrow. Personally he had lost the truest of friends, and even Saul had a place in his heart for he would contrast with his terrible death the early glories of his reign, when all Israel honoured him as its deliverer from the crushing yoke of foreign bondage, and when David was himself one of the most trusty of his captains. Otto von Gerlach compares David thus weeping over the fall of his implacable enemy with David's Son weeping over Jerusalem, the city whose inhabitants were his bitter foes, and who not only sought his death, but delivered him up to the Romans, to be scourged and spitefully intreated, and slain upon the cross. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They mourned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
