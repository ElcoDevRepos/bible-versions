In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/19.htm">2 Samuel 19</a>, King David is mourning the death of his son Absalom, who had led a rebellion against him. This mourning is seen as inappropriate by Joab, David's military commander, because Absalom was an enemy of the state. The cultural expectation in ancient Israel was for a king to prioritize the welfare of his loyal subjects and soldiers over personal feelings, especially when those feelings were for someone who had caused so much harm. This phrase can also be seen as a reflection of the broader biblical theme of misplaced affections, where love is given to those who oppose God's will.<p><b>and hate those who love you!</b><br>Joab accuses David of neglecting those who have shown him loyalty and love, namely his commanders and soldiers who risked their lives to protect his kingdom. In the historical context, loyalty to a king was paramount, and a king's failure to reciprocate that loyalty could lead to instability and loss of morale among his followers. This phrase underscores the tension between personal grief and public duty, a recurring theme in the life of David. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing and valuing the support of those who stand by us.<p><b>For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you.</b><br>Joab's rebuke points to the visible actions and attitudes of David, which have demoralized his troops. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's relationship with his military was crucial for maintaining power and security. The commanders and soldiers were the backbone of the kingdom's defense, and their loyalty was essential. By mourning Absalom so publicly, David inadvertently communicated that their sacrifices were unappreciated. This phrase highlights the need for leaders to balance personal emotions with their responsibilities to those they lead.<p><b>I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you!</b><br>This hyperbolic statement by Joab is meant to shock David into realizing the implications of his actions. It suggests that David's grief for Absalom has overshadowed his appreciation for the lives and loyalty of his followers. Historically, this reflects the intense personal and political turmoil David faced during Absalom's rebellion. Theologically, it can be seen as a moment of correction for David, urging him to realign his priorities with God's purposes for his kingship. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the cost of divided loyalties and the importance of valuing those who stand by us in times of trial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of his son Absalom, despite Absalom's rebellion against him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander, who confronts David about his excessive mourning for Absalom, which demoralizes the troops.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who led a rebellion against his father and was killed in battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David reigns, currently experiencing internal conflict due to Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commanders_and_soldiers.htm">The Commanders and Soldiers</a></b><br>The loyal men who fought for David against Absalom's forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_misplaced_affections.htm">The Danger of Misplaced Affections</a></b><br>David's mourning for Absalom, who sought his life, illustrates the potential for misplaced affections to cloud judgment and leadership responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_leadership_responsibility.htm">The Importance of Leadership Responsibility</a></b><br>Joab's rebuke highlights the necessity for leaders to balance personal emotions with their duties to those they lead.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_accountability.htm">The Role of Accountability</a></b><br>Joab's confrontation with David serves as a reminder of the importance of having people in our lives who can speak truth to us, even when it is uncomfortable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_grief_and_duty.htm">Balancing Grief and Duty</a></b><br>While grief is natural, it must be balanced with our responsibilities, especially when others depend on us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_rebellion.htm">The Cost of Rebellion</a></b><br>Absalom's account is a cautionary tale about the consequences of rebellion against God-ordained authority.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_19_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 19:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_19_6_Loyalty_leadership_test.htm">How does 2 Samuel 19:6 challenge our understanding of loyalty and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_valuing_relationships_2_Sam_19_6.htm">What can we learn about prioritizing relationships from 2 Samuel 19:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_19_6_vs_Jesus_on_love_loyalty.htm">How does 2 Samuel 19:6 connect with Jesus' teachings on love and loyalty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_act_after_hurting_loved_ones.htm">How should we respond when our actions hurt those we should love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_2_Samuel_19_6_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the lessons of 2 Samuel 19:6 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_19_6_Loyalty_in_leadership.htm">How does 2 Samuel 19:6 challenge the concept of loyalty in leadership?

By lingering in grief and refusing to greet the troops, David appears to cherish one who &#8220;rose up against his father&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/18-31.htm">2 Samuel 18:31</a>) while slighting those who risked their lives for him. The language echoes the prophet&#8217;s rebuke to King Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). It recalls <a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>, warning that repaying good with evil brings trouble. Joab&#8217;s words are hyperbole, yet they expose how unchecked emotion can misrepresent loyalty and justice. Scripture upholds compassion (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>) but never at the cost of truth or righteousness (<a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>). David&#8217;s sorrow is understandable, yet as king he must not let private grief overshadow covenant faithfulness to those who &#8220;loved&#8221; him through obedience (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a> shows the ideal of laying down one&#8217;s life for friends).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you.</b><p>Public perception matters in leadership. David&#8217;s men had begged him to remain behind for safety (<a href="/2_samuel/18-3.htm">2 Samuel 18:3</a>), then fought fiercely while he waited. His silence when they returned turned victory into mourning (<a href="/2_samuel/19-2.htm">2 Samuel 19:2</a>). In effect, Joab says David&#8217;s behavior signals that the lives of his captains and troops carry no value. Other passages stress honoring those who serve: David himself once poured out water offered by three mighty men to honor their sacrifice (<a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15-17</a>); Paul later urges believers to &#8220;acknowledge those who labor among you&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>). Leadership includes publicly affirming the righteous and defending them against misinterpretation (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>). Joab&#8217;s bluntness forces David to see the gap between his inner sorrow and the message it is sending to the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you!</b><p>Joab&#8217;s final thrust is deliberate exaggeration, yet it shocks David into action (<a href="/2_samuel/19-7.htm">2 Samuel 19:7</a>). The statement underlines how unbalanced grief can eclipse gratitude. Scripture often contrasts proper mourning with the need to rise and fulfill duty: Joshua had to stand after Moses&#8217; death (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1-2</a>); Samuel ceased mourning for Saul to anoint David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>). David&#8217;s love for Absalom was real, but Joab reminds him that a king&#8217;s covenant responsibility includes safeguarding those under his care (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19-20</a>). By showing Absalom&#8217;s life as preferable to his army&#8217;s, David would undermine the moral order where the wicked perish and the faithful are honored (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a>). The rebuke calls David to align his outward actions with the divine standard that vindicates the righteous and judges rebellion (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joab confronts David because the king&#8217;s public grief for Absalom has sent a disastrous message: love for the rebel, indifference toward the loyal. Scripture affirms compassionate hearts, yet leaders must uphold righteousness and honor those who sacrifice for them. Joab&#8217;s stern words jolt David into correcting his course, demonstrating that fidelity to God&#8217;s order sometimes requires hard counsel and decisive action to match heartfelt conviction with public responsibility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You love</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1469;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
