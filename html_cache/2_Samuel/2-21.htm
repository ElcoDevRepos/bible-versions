His role in the narrative of 2 Samuel is pivotal as he navigates the transition of power from the house of Saul to David. This phrase indicates Abner's attempt to communicate and possibly negotiate with Asahel, reflecting his strategic mindset and desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed among fellow Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;Turn to your right or to your left</b><br>This phrase suggests a tactical maneuver, urging Asahel to abandon his pursuit. In ancient warfare, such advice would be a way to avoid direct confrontation, especially when the pursuer is at a disadvantage. It reflects Abner's awareness of the potential consequences of a direct conflict with Asahel, who was known for his speed and determination.<p><b>seize one of the young men</b><br>Abner suggests that Asahel redirect his efforts towards a less formidable opponent. This reflects the common practice in ancient battles where warriors would seek to gain honor and spoils by defeating enemy soldiers. The mention of "young men" indicates the presence of less experienced or lower-ranking soldiers, highlighting the hierarchical nature of ancient military structures.<p><b>and take his equipment for yourself.&#8221;</b><br>In the context of ancient warfare, taking an opponent's equipment was both a practical and symbolic act. It provided the victor with valuable resources and served as a trophy of victory. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, where spoils of war were often collected and redistributed. Abner's suggestion implies a way for Asahel to gain honor without risking his life against a superior opponent.<p><b>But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</b><br>Asahel's relentless pursuit of Abner demonstrates his determination and bravery, traits highly valued in the warrior culture of ancient Israel. However, it also foreshadows the tragic outcome of his persistence. Asahel's refusal to heed Abner's advice highlights the tension between personal ambition and the broader implications of inter-tribal conflict. This moment is a turning point that leads to further strife between the house of Saul and the house of David, illustrating the complexities of loyalty and power during this transitional period in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, a key military leader in Israel, and a central figure in the power struggle following Saul's death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asahel.htm">Asahel</a></b><br>The brother of Joab and a swift runner, known for his speed and determination.

Compare his appeal to the restraint urged in <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>.<p>&#8226; The statement affirms the straightforward historicity of the narrative: real men, real choices, real consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Turn to your right or to your left,</b><p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s first plea is for Asahel to change course. Turning aside was a common Hebrew idiom for altering one&#8217;s path (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Abner offers an escape from a fatal collision. This echoes God&#8217;s frequent calls to His people to turn from a destructive pursuit (<a href="/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores personal responsibility&#8212;Asahel must decide whether to heed wise counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seize one of the young men,</b><p>&#8226; Abner suggests a culturally acceptable alternative: engage a lesser combatant. Warriors commonly proved valor by defeating an equal or lower-ranked foe (<a href="/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52&#8211;54</a>).<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;young men&#8221; points to abundant targets on the field, reminding Asahel that honor could be gained without confronting the seasoned general.<p>&#8226; It shows Abner&#8217;s respect for Asahel&#8217;s courage while protecting himself and, by extension, Joab from personal loss (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and take his equipment for yourself.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Spoils of war&#8212;armor, weapons, clothing&#8212;were trophies that validated a warrior&#8217;s prowess (<a href="/1_samuel/18-27.htm">1 Samuel 18:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-21.htm">2 Samuel 23:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Abner is offering Asahel the chance for recognition without triggering a blood-feud. In doing so he mirrors the principle of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>, seeking to prevent innocent blood from being shed within Israel.<p>&#8226; The request underscores the high value placed on honor and restitution in ancient Israelite warfare.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</b><p>&#8226; Asahel&#8217;s unwavering pursuit reveals determination turned to stubbornness. Proverbs warns, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and Asahel&#8217;s fixation blinds him to danger.<p>&#8226; His refusal sets the stage for his death in the next verse (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>), igniting a cycle of vengeance that will involve Joab and Abner in later chapters (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the line cautions against ignoring godly counsel and pursuing personal ambitions at all costs (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abner&#8217;s plea combines seasoned wisdom, respect, and a desire to avert needless bloodshed. He offers Asahel an honorable exit: change direction, defeat a lesser foe, claim the spoil. Asahel&#8217;s refusal illustrates how stubborn ambition overrides caution and ultimately leads to tragedy. The verse therefore stands as a literal historical warning: heed wise counsel, value life over personal glory, and recognize that unchecked determination can become destructive pride.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
