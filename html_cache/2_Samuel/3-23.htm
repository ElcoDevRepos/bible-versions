Joab is a key figure in David's reign, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions. The arrival of Joab and his troops signifies a moment of transition and potential conflict, as Joab's loyalty to David is strong, but his personal vendettas often complicate political matters.<p><b>he was informed</b><br>This phrase indicates that Joab receives news upon his return, setting the stage for his reaction.

This meeting is a turning point in the unification of Israel under David's rule.<p><b>who sent him on his way in peace.&#8221;</b><br>David's decision to send Abner away in peace reflects his desire for reconciliation and unity within the kingdom.

In royal courts, information functions like power (cf. <a href="/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The notice is factual, yet it instantly becomes combustible in Joab&#8217;s mind because the subject is Abner, the man who killed Joab&#8217;s brother Asahel (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows how unresolved bitterness can distort perception: facts filtered through wounded pride become demands for revenge (<a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abner son of Ner came to see the king</b><p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s visit signals a major shift in the civil war: the commander of Saul&#8217;s forces is defecting to David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s willingness to meet illustrates his trust in God&#8217;s promise to unite the kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), modeling reconciliation before personal vindication (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226; For Joab, however, Abner remains the enemy. The same event that advances God&#8217;s plan provokes Joab&#8217;s fear of losing status (cf. <a href="/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a> where Herod reacts to news of a rival king).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sent him on his way in peace</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;In peace&#8221; repeats twice in this chapter (vv. 21, 23), stressing David&#8217;s sincere intent. The peace is genuine, not political theater (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s action mirrors the law&#8217;s call to make peace with a former foe when possible (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Joab will interpret the phrase as weakness, leading to Abner&#8217;s murder (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>). The verse therefore functions as a moral fulcrum: God&#8217;s anointed king extends peace, but man&#8217;s unbridled anger cancels it (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-23.htm">2 Samuel 3:23</a> captures a collision of motives: David&#8217;s kingdom-minded grace meets Joab&#8217;s personal vendetta. Joab returns, hears that Abner&#8212;the slayer of his brother&#8212;has just been granted peaceful terms by the king, and bristles. The verse sets the stage for Joab&#8217;s rash retaliation and underscores David&#8217;s innocent, peace-seeking heart. It reminds us that even within God&#8217;s people, the choice between trusting God&#8217;s reconciling plan and clinging to wounded pride always stands before us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
