David, as the anointed king, leads the nation in a significant religious event. The "house of Israel" signifies the unity of the tribes under David's leadership, emphasizing the communal aspect of worship and national identity. This event marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as the Ark of the Covenant, representing God's presence, is being brought to Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of the nation.<p><b>brought up the ark of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was a sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna. It symbolized God's covenant with Israel and His presence among them. The act of bringing up the Ark to Jerusalem signifies the establishment of Jerusalem as the religious heart of Israel. This event fulfills David's desire to make the city not only the political capital but also the spiritual center, foreshadowing the future temple built by Solomon. The Ark's journey also echoes the Israelites' earlier travels, reminding them of God's guidance and faithfulness.<p><b>with shouting</b><br>The shouting represents the people's joy and reverence as they celebrate the Ark's arrival. This expression of worship is communal and exuberant, reflecting the deep spiritual significance of the event. Shouting in biblical times often accompanied significant religious ceremonies and victories, as seen in <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a> during the fall of Jericho. It symbolizes triumph, celebration, and the acknowledgment of God's mighty acts.<p><b>and the sounding of the ram&#8217;s horn</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, was used in Israel for various purposes, including religious ceremonies, signaling, and warfare. Its sound here underscores the sacredness of the occasion and serves as a call to worship. The use of the shofar is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a> during the Year of Jubilee and in the battle of Jericho. It signifies God's presence and power, and its use in this context highlights the Ark's importance and the divine approval of the event.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is leading the procession to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

In <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> he personally leads the procession, showing that leadership in worship begins with the leader himself. Earlier he &#8220;arose and went with all the people&#8230; to bring up from there the ark of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>), underscoring a determined obedience that refused to delegate this sacred task. <a href="/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3-5</a> records his vow not to rest until the ark had a rightful place. In short, David&#8217;s presence at the front testifies that passionate, hands-on involvement in the things of God is both expected and honored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the house of Israel</b><p>This phrase widens the lens: every tribe, elder, and commoner participates. Together they form one &#8220;house,&#8221; echoing the covenant identity forged at Sinai when &#8220;all the people answered together, &#8216;We will do everything the LORD has spoken&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>). United worship cancels isolation. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a>, where &#8220;all Israel&#8221; seeks the ark, and <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where collective love for the LORD is commanded. Corporate joy here points forward to the church as &#8220;one body&#8221; rejoicing in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>brought up the ark of the LORD</b><p>The ark is no mere relic; it is the throne of the invisible God, the place where He said, &#8220;There I will meet with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). Bringing it &#8220;up&#8221; to Jerusalem indicates elevation&#8212;physically up the hills and spiritually into the national center. <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a> reminds us the ark carried &#8220;the Name, the very name of the LORD of Hosts.&#8221; After the earlier tragedy with Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-11</a>), the Levites now carry it correctly (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12-15</a>), illustrating that heartfelt zeal must align with revealed instructions. The procession proclaims that God&#8217;s presence, once central in the wilderness, must remain central in the kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with shouting</b><p>Worship is audible joy, not silent formality. The Hebrew army shouted when the ark entered camp in <a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>, and <a href="/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a> calls, &#8220;Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with a voice of triumph.&#8221; These shouts are faith&#8217;s overflow&#8212;public acknowledgment that God reigns. The volume is not empty noise but a confession that the King has come near, and His nearness demands exuberance (<a href="/psalms/100-1.htm">Psalm 100:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the sounding of the ram&#8217;s horn</b><p>The shofar announces freedom (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>), victory (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>), and kingship (<a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm">1 Kings 1:34</a>). Blowing it here blends all three: freedom from past neglect, victory over Philistine humiliation, and the enthronement of the LORD in Zion. <a href="/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a> parallels this scene: &#8220;All Israel brought up the ark&#8230; with shouting, with the sounding of horns, trumpets, and cymbals.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/98-6.htm">Psalm 98:6</a> urges, &#8220;With trumpets and the blast of the ram&#8217;s horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.&#8221; The shofar bridges earth and heaven, calling worshipers into God&#8217;s jubilant presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a> captures a pinnacle of covenant life: David personally leads, the entire nation unites, God&#8217;s dwelling is exalted, and joy erupts in shouts and trumpet blasts. It means that when God&#8217;s presence is honored according to His Word, leaders and people alike are invited&#8212;indeed compelled&#8212;to celebrate with wholehearted, audible praise, affirming that the LORD alone is King in their midst.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">while he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
