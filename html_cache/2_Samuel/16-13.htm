This journey is a humbling experience for David, reflecting the consequences of his past sins, particularly the incident with Bathsheba and Uriah. The road symbolizes the path of suffering and repentance that David must walk, reminiscent of the trials faced by God's chosen leaders throughout Scripture.<p><b>as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him</b><br>Shimei, a member of the house of Saul, represents the lingering animosity and division within Israel. His position on the ridge signifies a place of perceived superiority and judgment over David. This scene echoes the broader theme of opposition faced by God's anointed, paralleling the rejection and scorn that Jesus would later endure from those who opposed His messianic mission.<p><b>As Shimei went, he yelled curses</b><br>Shimei's curses are a manifestation of the deep-seated resentment against David, reflecting the political and personal grievances that have festered since Saul's reign. In the cultural context, cursing a king was a serious offense, yet David's restraint in not retaliating highlights his submission to God's sovereignty and justice, trusting that God will vindicate him in due time.<p><b>threw stones</b><br>The act of throwing stones is symbolic of judgment and condemnation. In biblical times, stoning was a method of execution for blasphemy and other serious offenses. Shimei's actions can be seen as an attempt to publicly shame and condemn David, yet they also foreshadow the unjust accusations and physical abuse that Jesus would face during His passion.<p><b>and flung dust at David</b><br>Flinging dust is an expression of contempt and derision, signifying the lowly state to which David has been reduced. This act underscores the humiliation and suffering that David endures, serving as a type of Christ, who bore the scorn and rejection of humanity. The imagery of dust also recalls the curse of the fall, highlighting the brokenness of the world and the need for redemption through God's chosen king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.
