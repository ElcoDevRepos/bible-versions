His inquiry reflects his desire to fulfill a covenant promise he made to Jonathan, Saul's son, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>. David's kingship is characterized by justice and kindness, aligning with the biblical ideal of a godly ruler.<p><b>&#8220;Is there anyone left of the house of Saul</b><br>The house of Saul refers to the family and descendants of Saul, the first king of Israel. After Saul's death, his house was largely decimated due to the conflict between Saul and David. This inquiry shows David's willingness to extend grace and mercy, contrasting with the common practice of eliminating rival dynasties to secure one's throne.<p><b>to whom I can show the kindness of God?&#8221;</b><br>The "kindness of God" refers to the Hebrew word "chesed," which denotes steadfast love, mercy, and covenant faithfulness. David's desire to show this kindness reflects God's own character and foreshadows the New Testament teaching of grace. This act of kindness is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where grace is extended to those who are undeserving.<p><b>Ziba answered,</b><br>Ziba is a servant from Saul's household. His role here is significant as he becomes the intermediary who connects David with the remaining member of Saul's family. Ziba's knowledge of Jonathan's son indicates his continued service and loyalty to Saul's house.<p><b>&#8220;There is still Jonathan&#8217;s son,</b><br>Jonathan was Saul's son and David's close friend. The mention of Jonathan's son highlights the enduring bond between David and Jonathan, despite the enmity between David and Saul. This connection underscores the theme of covenant loyalty and friendship.<p><b>who is lame in both feet.&#8221;</b><br>This detail about Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, is significant. His lameness is a result of an accident when he was five years old, as described in <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical disabilities often led to marginalization. David's willingness to honor and care for Mephibosheth despite his disability reflects God's inclusive love and foreshadows the gospel's message of grace to all, regardless of status or condition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his desire to show kindness to the house of Saul, despite Saul's previous attempts to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>A servant of Saul's household who informs David about the existence of Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David, who had made a covenant with David to show kindness to each other's families.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan, described as "lame in both feet," representing vulnerability and need.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_saul.htm">House of Saul</a></b><br>The former royal family of Israel, now largely fallen from power, with remaining members living in obscurity or fear.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>David's inquiry about Saul's descendants demonstrates his commitment to the covenant he made with Jonathan.
