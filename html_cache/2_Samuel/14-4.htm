It was known for its wise inhabitants, as seen in the prophet Amos, who was also from Tekoa. The woman from Tekoa was sent by Joab, David's military commander, to present a parable to King David. This reflects the use of intermediaries and parables in ancient Near Eastern cultures to convey messages to rulers. The choice of a woman from Tekoa highlights the strategic use of wisdom and diplomacy in addressing the king.<p><b>she fell facedown in homage</b><br>Falling facedown was a common gesture of respect and submission in ancient cultures, especially when approaching a king. This act of homage signifies the woman's recognition of the king's authority and her plea for his favor. It reflects the hierarchical nature of society at the time, where kings were seen as God's appointed rulers, deserving of reverence and obedience.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Help me, O king!&#8221;</b><br>The plea for help indicates a desperate situation, often used in biblical narratives to elicit compassion and action from the listener. In this context, the woman's cry for help is part of Joab's plan to persuade David to reconcile with his estranged son Absalom. This phrase echoes other biblical instances where individuals cry out to God or a king for deliverance, such as in the Psalms. It underscores the theme of seeking justice and mercy from those in power, a recurring motif in the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_from_tekoa.htm">The Woman from Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman sent by Joab to King David to present a parable that would lead to the reconciliation between David and his son Absalom.
