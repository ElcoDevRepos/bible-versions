His advanced age also highlights his long-standing loyalty and service, which would have been highly esteemed. In biblical terms, reaching such an age was often seen as a sign of God's blessing (<a href="/genesis/25-7.htm">Genesis 25:7-8</a>). The mention of his age underscores the significance of his actions and the respect he commanded.<p><b>and since he was a very wealthy man</b><br>Barzillai's wealth is indicative of God's favor and blessing, as material prosperity was often seen as a sign of divine approval in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). His wealth enabled him to support King David, reflecting the biblical principle of using one's resources to serve God's anointed. Wealth in the Bible is frequently accompanied by a responsibility to aid others, as seen in the lives of other wealthy figures like Abraham and Job.<p><b>he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim</b><br>Mahanaim was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, located east of the Jordan River. It served as a strategic location during Absalom's rebellion against David. Barzillai's provision for David during his stay there demonstrates loyalty and support during a time of political upheaval. This act of service is reminiscent of the support given to God's chosen leaders throughout Scripture, such as the support Moses received from Aaron and Hur (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>).
