The use of messengers indicates a formal and deliberate action, reflecting the king's ability to summon individuals at will. This action is set against the backdrop of David's kingship, where he was expected to uphold justice and righteousness. The sending of messengers also underscores the lack of personal interaction and the impersonal nature of the act, which contrasts with the personal and intimate nature of the sin that follows. This moment foreshadows the misuse of power that leads to further transgressions.<p><b>and when she came to him</b><br>Bathsheba's compliance in coming to David can be seen as a reflection of the societal norms and expectations of the time, where a king's request was not easily refused. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed women in a position where they had limited agency, especially in the face of royal authority. This phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding of events that lead to significant consequences for both David and Bathsheba, as well as the nation of Israel.<p><b>he slept with her</b><br>This phrase marks the pivotal moment of sin, where David's actions violate the commandments against adultery. The act of sleeping with Bathsheba is not just a personal moral failure but a breach of covenantal law, which had severe implications for David's relationship with God and his role as king. This sin sets off a chain of events that lead to personal and national turmoil, illustrating the biblical principle that sin has far-reaching consequences. The narrative here connects to other scriptures that warn against the dangers of lust and the importance of self-control.<p><b>(Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.)</b><br>This parenthetical note provides important context regarding Bathsheba's ritual purity, indicating that she had recently completed her menstrual cycle and undergone the required purification rites as outlined in Levitical law. This detail serves to clarify that Bathsheba was not pregnant prior to her encounter with David, emphasizing the certainty of David's paternity in the subsequent pregnancy. The mention of purification also highlights the contrast between ritual cleanliness and the moral impurity of the act that follows.<p><b>Then she returned home</b><br>Bathsheba's return home signifies the end of the immediate encounter but also the beginning of a series of events that will have lasting repercussions. Her return to her own house underscores the temporary and transactional nature of the encounter, lacking the covenantal commitment that marriage entails. This phrase also foreshadows the isolation and vulnerability Bathsheba will experience as the narrative progresses, as well as the eventual exposure of the sin and its consequences. The return home is a moment of transition that sets the stage for the unfolding drama of repentance, judgment, and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who falls into sin by committing adultery with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who is brought to David and becomes pregnant by him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Individuals sent by David to bring Bathsheba to him, playing a role in the unfolding of this event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, serving as the backdrop for David's moral failure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/purification.htm">Purification</a></b><br>Bathsheba had just completed a ritual purification, indicating the timing of the event and her state of ceremonial cleanliness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>David's actions lead to a series of tragic events, reminding us that sin often has far-reaching consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_accountability.htm">The Importance of Accountability</a></b><br>David's isolation as king may have contributed to his moral failure.

David's fall seems as sudden as it was complete; but we may feel sure that there had been gradual preparation for it during the previous period of great prosperity. David had always been a man of strong passions, and the large harem he had set up at Jerusalem, so far from satisfying him, only intensified his lust. And now he who had previously shown himself so chivalrous and noble stoops to robbing one of his own officers of his honour. And stern and terrible was the punishment. When he sent those messengers, who were some of the vile people who hang about great personages, ready to minister to their sins, he was preparing the way for his daughter's disgrace, for the murder of Amnon, for Absalom's rebellion and death, and for the death of Adonijah. From that day his own house was the scene of horrible crimes, feuds, scandals, and miseries of every kind; and the long interval after his repentance, between the birth of Solomon and David's death, is passed over in gloomy silence. No act of the penitent king after his restoration to the throne is deemed worthy of record. He was pardoned, but his place henceforward was not in the light of God's favour, but in shadow and retirement. Men who fall so grievously must be content to be removed into the outer court. Of Bathsheba it must be said that she remained a faithful wife, and bare David four sons besides the one who was the fruit of their adultery, and that she retained her influence over him to the last (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For she was purified from her uncleanness;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and she purified herself from her uncleanness</span>; that is, having committed an act of gross immorality, she nevertheless carefully observed the ceremonial enactment commanded in <a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>.
