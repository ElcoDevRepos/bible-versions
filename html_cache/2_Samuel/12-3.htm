The poor man's possession of only one small ewe lamb underscores his poverty and vulnerability. In ancient Israel, sheep were valuable assets, and owning even one lamb was significant for a poor man. This lamb symbolizes the man's limited wealth and deep personal attachment, as he had invested in it by purchasing it. The imagery of a lamb is also significant in biblical typology, often representing innocence and sacrifice, foreshadowing Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children.</b><br>The relationship between the man and the lamb is depicted as familial and nurturing. Raising the lamb alongside his children suggests a deep bond and affection, elevating the lamb from mere property to a beloved family member. This reflects the cultural practice of shepherding in ancient Israel, where animals were often integral to family life. The nurturing aspect can be seen as a metaphor for God's care for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd.<p><b>It shared his food and drank from his cup;</b><br>This phrase illustrates the intimacy and care the man had for the lamb, treating it as an equal rather than livestock. Sharing food and drink signifies a close relationship, akin to that of family members. In the cultural context, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and trust. This imagery can be connected to the communal aspects of the early Christian church, where believers shared meals and resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-46</a>).<p><b>it slept in his arms and was like a daughter to him.</b><br>The lamb's place in the man's arms signifies protection, love, and tenderness, akin to a parent-child relationship. This deep emotional connection emphasizes the man's affection and the lamb's importance in his life. The comparison to a daughter highlights the depth of the bond and the man's sense of responsibility and care. This can be seen as a reflection of God's love for His children, as expressed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, where God's care is likened to that of a mother for her child.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah.

The setup contrasts starkly with David&#8217;s abundance (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except one small ewe lamb that he had bought</b><p>&#8226; The lamb is the man&#8217;s single treasure&#8212;purchased, not seized. Buying reflects honest labor and rightful ownership (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;small&#8221; lamb highlights vulnerability (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) and points forward to the ultimate Lamb, Christ, who too was gentle and undefended (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He raised it</b><p>&#8226; Raising the lamb implies continual care and daily attention, mirroring how a shepherd knows each sheep (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Stewardship of God-given resources is implied: &#8220;A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it grew up with him and his children</b><p>&#8226; The lamb shares the family&#8217;s ordinary life&#8212;meals, chores, play.

The language evokes adoption (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>) and God&#8217;s pledge, &#8220;I will be a Father to you&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Nathan&#8217;s parable thus equates Bathsheba with this cherished lamb, exposing David&#8217;s sin as a heartless robbery of another man&#8217;s &#8220;daughter.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nathan stacks detail upon detail to help David sense the depth of the poor man&#8217;s attachment: total poverty, single treasure, daily nurture, shared life, intimate table fellowship, restful embrace, daughter-like love. Each phrase confronts the king with the horror of stealing what little someone cherishes most. By the time Nathan declares, &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), David&#8217;s conscience is primed for repentance. The verse reminds us that God defends the vulnerable, values faithful stewardship, and sees every secret wrong&#8212;calling His people to honor both Him and one another with pure hearts and clean hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">It grew up together.</span>--"All these circumstances are exquisitely contrived to heighten the pity of the hearer for the oppressed, and his indignation against the oppressor."--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was unto him as a daughter.</span> The Orientals are excessively fond of pet animals, and, as the dog is with them unclean, its place is taken by fawns, kids, or lambs. The description, therefore, is not overcharged, for in many an English home the dog or cat takes its place as one of the family. The Revised Version preserves the tenderness of the original in translating "it did eat of his own morsel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but the poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l, Article &#124;
