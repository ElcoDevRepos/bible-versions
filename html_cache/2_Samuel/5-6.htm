Jerusalem, a city with a strategic location, was not yet under Israelite control. The march signifies David's intention to establish a political and spiritual center for his kingdom. Jerusalem's central location in the tribal territories made it an ideal capital. This move also fulfills earlier prophecies and promises about the establishment of a unified kingdom under David's rule.<p><b>against the Jebusites who inhabited the land</b><br>The Jebusites were a Canaanite tribe that inhabited Jerusalem. Despite Israel's conquest of Canaan, the Jebusites had maintained control over this fortified city. Their presence in Jerusalem represents the incomplete conquest of the Promised Land, as described in the Book of Joshua. The Jebusites' continued occupation of Jerusalem highlights the challenges Israel faced in fully claiming the land God had promised them.<p><b>The Jebusites said to David: &#8220;You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.&#8221;</b><br>This taunt from the Jebusites reflects their confidence in the city's defenses. Jerusalem was a well-fortified city, situated on a hill, making it difficult to conquer. The Jebusites' mockery suggests that they believed their city was impregnable, even to the point that the weakest among them could defend it. This statement also underscores the spiritual blindness and arrogance of those who oppose God's anointed king, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>For they thought, &#8220;David cannot get in here.&#8221;</b><br>The Jebusites' confidence in their defenses was misplaced, as they underestimated David's military prowess and God's favor upon him. This phrase foreshadows David's eventual victory and the establishment of Jerusalem as the City of David. It also serves as a reminder of the futility of opposing God's plans. David's conquest of Jerusalem is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over spiritual strongholds, establishing His kingdom in the hearts of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel, who is leading his men to conquer Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jebusites.htm">Jebusites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem at the time, who were confident in their city's defenses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>A significant city that would become the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David's Men</a></b><br>The loyal followers and warriors of David, who played a crucial role in his military campaigns.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_and_lame.htm">The Blind and Lame</a></b><br>A metaphor used by the Jebusites to mock David, suggesting that their city was so well-defended that even the weakest could defend it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>David's conquest of Jerusalem demonstrates God's hand in establishing leaders according to His purpose.

He could not remain in Hebron, as it was too far to the south, nor would haughty tribes such as Ephraim have consented to be merged into Judah. On the other hand, he could not move far away, as Judah was his main strength. But living in its neighbourhood, he must often have noticed the remarkable position of the city of Jebus, and admired its rock girt strength (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>). Though the Jebusites had been conquered by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), and Jerusalem captured (<a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), yet, as the children of Judah did not occupy it, but "set the city on fire," it seems to have been soon repeopled by its old inhabitants, who there maintained their independence, and, owing to the impregnable nature of its site, could not be treated as Saul treated the Gibeonite inhabitants of Beeroth. Even subsequently, the Jebusite chief who possessed what probably was Mount Moriah, still bore the titular rank of king; for the words in ch. 24:23 literally are, "All this did Araunah the king give unto the king." The explanation of this long independence of the Jebusites is to be found not only in the feebleness of the tribes during the troubled times of the judges, but even mere in the conformation of the site of their stronghold. Jerusalem is situated on the edge of the precipitous wall which forms the western boundary of the valley of the Jordan, and occupies a promontory, on three sides of which are ravines so abrupt and steep that, were it not for their vast depth, they might seem to have been the work of man. On the north side alone it is open to attack, but even there, when the besieger has obtained an entrance, he finds the city divided by another ravine into two parts; whereof the western portion contains the strong citadel of Mount Zion, while the eastern and smaller portion contains the less elevated mountain of Moriah. Though actually raised above the sea level several hundred feet less than Hebron, it seems to the eye more emphatically a mountain-city; and being well nigh encircled by the valleys of Ben-Hinnom and Jehoshaphat, it seems to sit enthroned above the Jordan valley, compared with which it enjoys a cool and refreshing climate. To its inhabitants it was "beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth" (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, Revised Version); to the exiles it was "the city of God," to which their hearts ever turned; to us Christians it is the type of Christ's Church on earth, and of his kingdom in heaven. It was an act worthy of David's genius to foresee the great future of the place, and to inaugurate his kingdom by its capture. We gather from <a href="/ezekiel/16-45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a> that at the time when the Hittites were the dominant race in Syria, Jerusalem was one of their fortresses. The name is a dual, literally <span class="accented">Yerushalaim</span>, and probably the town was so called because it consisted of two parts - the upper and the lower city. <span class="accented">Shalaim</span> means the "two Salems," thus carrying our minds back to the city of Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). In <a href="/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> Salem is apparently contrasted with Zion, and so would be the lower town, containing Mount Moriah. Of the other part of the word, <span class="accented">Yeru</span>, numerous derivations are given, of which the only probable one is that which connects it with "Yehovah-yireh" - "God will see to it," the name given to the spot where Abraham on this mountain offered a vicarious sacrifice for his son. We must, however, bear in mind that towns retain the names which they bore in primitive times, and that the name of a Hittite fortress belongs probably to the language of that people. Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither. These words have been a sore puzzle to commentators, and many strange explanations have been given. Rashi says that the <span class="accented">blind</span> meant Isaac, and the <span class="accented">lame</span> Jacob, and that the words referred to an old compact by which Abraham gave Jerusalem to the Jebusites, and that Isaac and Jacob had confirmed this agreement. Unless, then, David was prepared to violate this covenant, he must abstain from the attack. We get no help from <a href="/1_chronicles/11-5.htm">1 Chronicles 11:5</a>, as the words are there omitted, probably because they were not supposed to have any important meaning. The Orientals delighted in dark sayings, and possibly there was here some local reference which the people of Jerusalem would understand, but which is lost for us. But evidently it was a boastful defiance, and may mean that the Jebusites pretended that it would be enough to post only their feeblest men, the blind and the lame, for defense, and that David would try in vain to break through them. <span class="cmt_word">Thinking</span>;
