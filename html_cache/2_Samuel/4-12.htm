Rechab and Baanah had murdered Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, expecting a reward from David. However, David's response aligns with his previous actions in <a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>, where he executed the Amalekite who claimed to have killed Saul. This demonstrates David's respect for God's anointed and his commitment to justice, regardless of personal gain.<p><b>They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron,</b><br>The mutilation of Rechab and Baanah's bodies served as a public display of justice and a deterrent against treachery. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such acts were common to shame and dishonor criminals. The pool in Hebron was a central and public location, ensuring that the message of justice was widely seen. Hebron, a significant city in Judah, was where David was first anointed king (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>), adding to the gravity of the act.<p><b>but they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in Abner&#8217;s tomb in Hebron.</b><br>The burial of Ish-bosheth's head in Abner's tomb signifies respect and honor, contrasting with the treatment of Rechab and Baanah. Abner, Saul's cousin and commander, had been a key figure in supporting Ish-bosheth's reign (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-9</a>). By burying Ish-bosheth's head with Abner, David acknowledges their connection and perhaps seeks to bring closure to the house of Saul. This act also reflects David's consistent respect for Saul's family, as seen in his lament for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his just leadership.

The hands were cut off because they had committed the murder; the feet, because they had brought the head to Hebron. Still, David was violating the spirit of the Mosaic Law. It ordered that the body of a man who had been put to death should be buried the same day (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). In the face of this humane enactment, it is wonderful that the laws of Christian countries should have allowed the mutilation of the bodies of traitors, and the hanging on gibbets of criminals convicted of smaller crimes. Remembering, therefore, the customs of our fathers, we must not blame David much for suspending the bands and feet of these murderers at the pool of Hebron, that all, when coming for water, might know of their punishment.
