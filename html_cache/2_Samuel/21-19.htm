Gob is mentioned as a location of conflict, though its exact location is uncertain. This phrase indicates the ongoing struggle between Israel and the Philistines, highlighting the persistent threat they posed. The Philistines were known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, which often put Israel at a disadvantage. This context sets the stage for the heroism and divine intervention often seen in these battles.<p><b>and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite</b><br>Elhanan is identified as the son of Jair and a Bethlehemite, linking him to Bethlehem, the same town as King David. This connection to Bethlehem is significant, as it is a town with a rich biblical history, including being the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Elhanan's lineage and hometown may suggest a connection to the Davidic line, emphasizing the importance of Bethlehem in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite</b><br>This phrase clarifies a common textual issue, as some manuscripts and translations suggest Elhanan killed Goliath himself. However, this passage specifies that Elhanan killed the brother of Goliath, maintaining consistency with <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, which names the brother as Lahmi. Goliath, the giant slain by David, was a Gittite, indicating he was from Gath, a major Philistine city. This connection to Goliath underscores the ongoing threat of the Philistines and the continued valor of Israelite warriors.<p><b>the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam</b><br>This description of the spear's shaft being like a weaver's beam emphasizes the formidable nature of the Philistine warriors. A weaver's beam was a large, heavy piece of equipment, suggesting the immense size and strength of the opponent. This imagery is reminiscent of the description of Goliath's weaponry in <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>, drawing a parallel between the two battles and highlighting the recurring theme of God empowering His people to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elhanan.htm">Elhanan</a></b><br>A warrior from Bethlehem, identified as the son of Jaare-oregim.

Israel had already seen God&#8217;s power over giants through David, yet more challenges arose. This verse encourages us to stay alert and keep depending on the Lord when new struggles appear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the Philistines</b><p>The Philistines remained Israel&#8217;s most stubborn enemy (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>). Their relentless attacks picture the ongoing pressure believers face from the world system (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>). Each confrontation in Scripture shows God proving His supremacy over the false gods of Philistia (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-4</a>) and protecting His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Gob</b><p>Gob was a battlefield in the territory of Benjamin, not far from Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/21-18.htm">2 Samuel 21:18</a>). Mentioning the place grounds the story in history and reminds us the Bible records real events in real locations. The land itself became a testimony to the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness, just as earlier sites like Mizpah and Ebenezer had (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite</b><p>Elhanan, listed among David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>), comes from Bethlehem&#8212;the same town as David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>). God raised up more faithful warriors from the same humble village, showing that He continues His work through ordinary people who trust Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> explicitly names the giant &#8220;Lahmi the brother of Goliath,&#8221; clarifying any confusion and underscoring Scripture&#8217;s internal harmony. Just as David&#8217;s earlier victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>) showcased God&#8217;s power, Elhanan&#8217;s triumph proves the giants&#8217; defeat was no fluke. The Lord empowers His servants to finish what was started, eliminating every threat that exalts itself against Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam</b><p>The Spirit again highlights the intimidating size of the weapon (compare <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>). Giants wield enormous tools, yet they fall before those who trust the Lord (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>). The detail magnifies the miracle&#8212;humanly speaking, Elhanan should have been outmatched, but the battle is the Lord&#8217;s (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a> records another historical, literal victory in Israel&#8217;s long war with the Philistines. At Gob, God used Elhanan of Bethlehem to slay Lahmi, Goliath&#8217;s brother, whose massive spear underscores the odds he faced. The verse reminds us that battles keep coming, enemies persist, and giants still loom large, but the Lord faithfully equips ordinary believers to stand firm and prevail, completing the work He began.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Jaare-oregim.</span>--The parallel place, <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm" title="And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1Chronicles 20:5</a>, reads simply "Jair." It is generally supposed that "oregim(= <span class= "ital">weavers</span>) has accidentally crept into the text from the line below, and "Jai" and "Jaare" are the same with a slight transposition of the letters. Another name for the same person must have been "Dodo," if this Elhanan, as seems altogether probable, is the same with "Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem," one of the thirty-seven heroes, in <a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm" title="Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,">2Samuel 23:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The brother of.</span>--These words, not found in the Hebrew here, are taken from Chronicles, where also the name of the giant, "Lahmi," is given. It is quite possible, however, that the word "Beth-lemite," which is wanting in Chronicles, is a corruption of "Lahmi the brother of." There is a curious Jewish tradition that this Elhanan was David himself, and this has been preserved in the paraphrase of the Chaldee, "and David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite.</span> The words "the brother of" are inserted by the Authorized Version in order to bring this place into verbal agreement with <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, where we read that "Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." The Jewish Targum had the same reading as that still found in the text, but regards Elhanan, "God is gracious," as another name for David, and, instead of Jair or Jaare, reads Jesse. Its translation is as follows: "And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite." Possibly the Authorized Version is right in concluding that the present text is a corruption of that in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. For, first, the repetition of <span class="accented">oregim</span>, "weavers," is suspicious, the Hebrew being, not "weaver's beam," but the plural "weavers' beam," <span class="accented">menor oregim.</span> Next, <span class="accented">Jaare</span> is a transposition of the letters of Jair (in the Hebrew) made probably in order that the compound <span class="accented">Jaare-oregim</span> may obey the rules of Hebrew grammar. More important is it to notice that <span class="accented">Lahmi</span> is part of the word "Bethlehemite" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-hallahmi</span>), and might thus easily suggest to the eye of a scribe the completion of so well known a word. We must add that among the thirty Gibborim is "Elhanan the son of <span class="accented">Dodo</span> of Bethlehem." Whoever slew Goliath's brother would certainly attain to high rank among the heroes, but if the name <span class="accented">Jair</span> is right, the Elhanan there spoken of is not the person who slew Lahmi. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
