This familial connection places Jonadab within the royal family, giving him access to insider information. His role in the narrative highlights the complex family dynamics and political intrigue within David's court. Jonadab's earlier involvement in advising Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3-5</a>) shows his cunning nature, which is consistent with his ability to assess the situation quickly and accurately.<p><b>My lord must not think they have killed all the sons of the king:</b><br>Jonadab addresses King David, attempting to calm his fears. The phrase reflects the immediate panic and chaos following the news of the attack on the king's sons. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the death of royal heirs could lead to political instability and power struggles. Jonadab's reassurance is crucial in preventing David from making rash decisions based on incomplete information.<p><b>For only Amnon is dead:</b><br>This statement confirms the targeted nature of the attack. Amnon, as the eldest son of David, was a significant figure in the line of succession. His death is a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it removes a potential heir and sets the stage for further conflict within David's family. The focus on Amnon's death underscores the personal vendetta of Absalom, who seeks justice for his sister Tamar.<p><b>In fact, Absalom has planned this since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar:</b><br>This phrase reveals the premeditated nature of Absalom's actions. The violation of Tamar by Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13:1-14</a>) is a critical event that sets off a chain reaction of vengeance and retribution. Absalom's calculated response reflects the cultural importance of family honor and the severe consequences of sexual misconduct. The reference to Absalom's long-standing plan highlights his patience and determination, traits that foreshadow his later rebellion against David. This incident also illustrates the broader theme of sin and its repercussions within David's household, echoing Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a> about the sword never departing from David's house.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab.htm">Jonadab</a></b><br>The son of Shimeah, David's brother, making him David's nephew.
