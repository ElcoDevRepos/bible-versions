Abner, Saul's cousin and commander of his army, was a key military leader. The Benjamites' loyalty to Abner reflects their allegiance to Saul's house, even after his death. This rallying indicates a strong tribal unity and loyalty, which was common in ancient Israelite society. The Benjamites' support for Abner also highlights the ongoing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David, as Abner was a staunch supporter of Saul's lineage.<p><b>formed a single unit</b><br>The formation of a single unit suggests military organization and discipline. In ancient warfare, unity and cohesion were crucial for effectiveness in battle. This phrase indicates that the Benjamites were not just a group of individuals but a coordinated force, ready to defend their position. This unity can be seen as a reflection of their determination to maintain the legacy of Saul's house against the rising power of David.<p><b>and took their stand atop a hill</b><br>Taking a stand atop a hill was a strategic military move, as high ground offered a tactical advantage in ancient warfare. It provided better visibility and a defensive position against attackers. This action demonstrates the Benjamites' readiness to defend themselves and their cause. Hills and high places often held significant strategic and symbolic importance in biblical narratives, representing strength and protection. This setting also foreshadows the ongoing struggle for power and the eventual transition of kingship from Saul's house to David's.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, known for their warrior skills.

They were, too, a very warlike tribe, and Abner was one of themselves, and probably, therefore, the main body of his army, and certainly his most trustworthy men, were Benjamites. Profiting by the delay caused by the halting of David's soldiers round the body of the fallen Asahel, Abner had rallied his men, and posted them on the top of the hill, where they were prepared now to fight on more equal terms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Benjamites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rallied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;qab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
