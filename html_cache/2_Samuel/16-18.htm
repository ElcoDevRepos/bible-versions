In this context, he is responding to Absalom, David's son, who has usurped the throne. Hushai's response is strategic, as he seeks to remain loyal to David while appearing to support Absalom. This reflects the wisdom and cunning often necessary in political and spiritual warfare, reminiscent of Jesus' instruction to be "shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves" (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><b>&#8220;For the one chosen by the LORD,</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief in divine sovereignty over Israel's leadership. David was anointed by the prophet Samuel as God's chosen king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>). Hushai's statement can be seen as a subtle affirmation of David's legitimate kingship, despite Absalom's rebellion. It reflects the biblical theme that God raises and removes leaders according to His purposes (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><b>by this people,</b><br>The reference to "this people" highlights the importance of communal support in leadership. In ancient Israel, the king was not only a political leader but also a spiritual representative of the people. The phrase suggests that true leadership is recognized and affirmed by the community, aligning with the biblical principle of unity and collective identity (<a href="/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13</a>).<p><b>and by all the men of Israel&#8212;</b><br>This emphasizes the national scope of the decision, involving all tribes of Israel. It reflects the unity and collective decision-making that characterized Israel's tribal confederation. The phrase also alludes to the broader acceptance and legitimacy required for a king, as seen in the anointing of Saul and David, where all Israel was involved (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p><b>his I will be,</b><br>Hushai's declaration of loyalty is significant in the context of covenant faithfulness, a key biblical theme. Loyalty to God's anointed king mirrors the loyalty expected of God's people to Him. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate anointed one, to whom believers pledge their allegiance (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>and with him I will remain.</b><br>This commitment to remain with the chosen leader reflects the biblical value of steadfastness and faithfulness. It echoes the loyalty of figures like Ruth, who remained with Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>), and anticipates the faithfulness of Christ, who remains with His people (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).

In doing so, Hushai positions himself as both faithful servant and strategic advocate, demonstrating that unwavering commitment to God&#8217;s anointed ultimately thwarts rebellion and preserves the LORD&#8217;s purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Israel.</span> Here and in ver. 15 the men of Israel are not contrasted with the men of Judah, but include them (see <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>). Absalom's rebellion began at Hebron, in Judaea, and the selection of Amasa, a first cousin both of David and Joab, as commander-in-chief, suggests the conclusion that Absalom's chief strength lay in David's own tribe, though men from all the tribes on the west of the Jordan had also flocked to his standard. Besides them, Hushai speaks of <span class="cmt_word">this people,</span> that is, the citizens of Jerusalem. For, while there had been general lamentation at David's departure (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>), yet the citizens had admitted Absalom without a struggle, and submitted to him. David's adherents are also constantly called "the people," because they did not belong to any special tribe, but were drawn indifferently from them all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Not at all,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hushai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#363;&#183;&#353;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2365.htm">Strong's 2365: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hushai -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
