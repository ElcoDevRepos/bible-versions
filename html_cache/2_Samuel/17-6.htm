In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/17.htm">2 Samuel 17</a>, Hushai's presence in Absalom's court was part of David's strategic plan to counteract the counsel of Ahithophel, who had defected to Absalom. This reflects the tension and division within the kingdom during Absalom's rebellion. Hushai's role as a double agent is crucial, as it demonstrates the theme of divine providence and loyalty amidst political intrigue.<p><b>who told him, &#8220;Ahithophel has spoken this proposal.</b><br>Ahithophel was known for his wise counsel, and his advice was highly regarded, almost as if one were consulting the word of God (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). His proposal to Absalom was to pursue David immediately, which was strategically sound. The mention of Ahithophel highlights the gravity of the situation, as his support lent significant credibility to Absalom's cause. This moment underscores the importance of counsel and the impact of wise or foolish decisions in leadership.<p><b>Should we carry it out?</b><br>Absalom's question indicates his reliance on advisors and his uncertainty despite his ambition. This moment of decision is pivotal, as it reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking and discerning wise counsel. The question also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's sovereign plan, as Absalom's choice will ultimately lead to his downfall. It serves as a reminder of the importance of aligning decisions with God's will.<p><b>If not, what do you say?&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's request for Hushai's opinion opens the door for Hushai to fulfill his mission of thwarting Ahithophel's advice. This phrase highlights the role of human agency within divine providence. Hushai's response will be instrumental in the preservation of David's life and the eventual restoration of his kingdom. It also illustrates the biblical principle that God can use individuals in unexpected ways to accomplish His purposes, often turning the wisdom of the world on its head (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai.htm">Hushai</a></b><br>A friend and loyal advisor to King David, who acts as a spy to counteract the counsel of Ahithophel and protect David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebels against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A highly esteemed counselor whose advice was considered almost as if one had consulted the word of God.
