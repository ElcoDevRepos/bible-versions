The context is the consequence of David's sin with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, Uriah. Nathan the prophet had foretold the child's death as a divine judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>). The death signifies the finality of God's judgment in this instance, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and its consequences.<p><b>why should I fast?</b><br>Fasting in the Old Testament was often associated with mourning, repentance, or seeking God's favor (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>, <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). David had fasted and prayed while the child was ill, hoping for God's mercy (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>). This rhetorical question indicates David's acceptance of God's will and the futility of fasting now that the child has died. It reflects a shift from seeking intervention to accepting God's sovereign decision.<p><b>Can I bring him back again?</b><br>This question underscores the irreversible nature of death. In the ancient Near Eastern context, death was seen as a one-way journey, with no return to earthly life. This aligns with the broader biblical understanding that life and death are in God's hands (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>). The question highlights human limitations and the acceptance of divine sovereignty over life and death.<p><b>I will go to him</b><br>David expresses a belief in an afterlife, suggesting that he will one day join his child in death. This reflects an early understanding of life beyond the grave, which is more fully developed in later biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>). It also conveys a sense of hope and reunion, indicating that death is not the end of existence.<p><b>but he will not return to me.</b><br>This final phrase reiterates the permanence of death and the separation it causes in this life. It acknowledges the reality that the child cannot return to the living, emphasizing the finality of earthly life. This acceptance is a crucial part of David's grieving process and reflects a trust in God's ultimate plan, even amidst personal loss. The phrase also subtly points to the future hope of resurrection and eternal life, themes that are central to Christian eschatology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrating the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who became pregnant by David, leading to the events surrounding the death of their child.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>God's messenger who confronted David about his sin, leading to David's repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The son born to David and Bathsheba, who became ill and died as a consequence of David's sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acceptance_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acceptance of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>David's response to his child's death demonstrates a profound acceptance of God's will.

He had pleaded for the child&#8217;s life (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>), but he now bows to God&#8217;s unalterable decision (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches that life and death rest with the Lord; once He has acted, no human effort can overturn His decree (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why should I fast?</b><p>&#8220;David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and he fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Fasting had been an expression of intercession and dependence on God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Continuing to fast after God&#8217;s answer would signal resistance rather than submission.

Later revelation confirms believers are &#8220;away from the body and at home with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement does not teach automatic salvation for all, but it does align with God&#8217;s compassionate character toward those unable to believe consciously (<a href="/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he will not return to me.</b><p>&#8226; Death&#8217;s separation on earth is final: &#8220;Man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; parable of the rich man and Lazarus highlights the same irreversible divide (<a href="/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a>).<p>&#8226; David acknowledges reality, setting an example of healthy, God-centered grief that neither denies loss nor despairs (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s five-fold statement models biblical grief:<p>&#8226; Accept God&#8217;s sovereign decision.<p>&#8226; End petition once God has spoken.<p>&#8226; Recognize human inability to reverse death.<p>&#8226; Rest in the hope of reunion with the redeemed.<p>&#8226; Live productively in the present, knowing earthly return is impossible.<p><a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a> therefore teaches believers to mourn with hope, submit to God&#8217;s final word, and look forward to eternal fellowship in His presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">I shall go to him.</span>--As far as the mere words themselves are concerned, this might be taken as the expression of a Stoic's comfort, "I shall go to the dead, but the dead will not come to me;" but David, in his whole nature and belief, was as far as possible from being a Stoic, and these words in his mouth can scarcely be anything else than an expression of confidence in a life of consciousness beyond the grave, and of the future recognition of those loved on earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I shall go to him, but he shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">not return to me.</span> These words indicate, first of all, much personal feeling for the child. Hence some have supposed that, as Solomon is placed last of Bathsheba's four sons in <a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, three other sons had already been borne by her, and that consequently this child, the fruit of their adultery, would now have been seven or eight years of age. It is certainly remarkable that in ver. 16 David calls him "the lad" (so the Hebrew), though in every other place he is styled "the child." On the other hand, we gather from ver. 14 that probably he was as yet the only child, and this is the more reasonable view, even if Solomon was the youngest son (but see note on ver. 24). But secondly, the words indicate a belief in the continued existence of the child, and even that David would recognize and know him in the future world. Less than this would have given no comfort to the father for his loss. Now, it is true that we can find no clear dogmatic teaching in the early Scriptures upon the immortality of the soul. Job could give expression to no such hope in Job 7:6-10, and the belief in a world to come would have solved the difficulties of himself and his friends, which really are left unsolved. Even in the Psalms there are words that border on despair (see <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>); nor had Hezekiah any such belief in continued existence as could solace him in the expectation of an early death (<a href="/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). This hopelessness was not unnatural at a time when the doctrine had not been as yet clearly taught. On the other hand, in <a href="/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a> and Psalm 16:9-11 We find proof that David did believe in his own immortality. For though the latter words have a second and higher meaning, yet the primary sense of <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> is that David's own soul (or self) would not always remain in Sheol, the abode of the departed, nor would he, Jehovah's anointed one, see such corruption as would end in annihilation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
