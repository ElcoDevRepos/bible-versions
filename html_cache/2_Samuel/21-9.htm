The Gibeonites were a group of people who had made a covenant with Israel during the time of Joshua (Joshua 9). Saul had violated this covenant by attempting to annihilate them, which led to a famine as divine retribution. David sought to make amends by asking the Gibeonites what would satisfy them, and they requested the execution of Saul's descendants. This act underscores the importance of covenant faithfulness in biblical times and the severe consequences of breaking such agreements.<p><b>and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD</b><br>The execution of Saul's descendants was carried out by hanging, a method of capital punishment that signified public disgrace and divine judgment. The phrase "before the LORD" indicates that this act was done with a sense of divine justice and acknowledgment of God's presence. The hill may have been a prominent location, possibly near Gibeah, Saul's hometown, or another significant site. This public execution served as a form of atonement for Saul's sin against the Gibeonites, reflecting the biblical principle of justice and retribution.<p><b>So all seven of them fell together</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible. The execution of all seven descendants at once may signify the complete fulfillment of the Gibeonites' demand for justice. This collective punishment highlights the communal nature of justice in ancient Israel, where the actions of one could affect the entire family or clan.<p><b>they were put to death in the first days of the harvest</b><br>The timing of the execution during the harvest season is significant. Harvest time was a period of celebration and thanksgiving, yet this event brought a somber note to the season. The famine that had plagued the land was directly linked to Saul's sin against the Gibeonites, and the resolution of this injustice was necessary for the land's restoration. The execution during the harvest may symbolize the hope of renewed blessing and fertility for the land following the act of atonement.<p><b>at the beginning of the barley harvest</b><br>The barley harvest typically occurred in the spring, around the time of Passover. This timing may have symbolic significance, as Passover is a time of deliverance and redemption in Jewish tradition. The execution of Saul's descendants at this time could be seen as a form of deliverance from the famine that had afflicted Israel. Additionally, the barley harvest was the first harvest of the year, marking a new beginning and the hope of future provision and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to make amends for Saul's sin against the Gibeonites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people who were wronged by Saul, leading to a famine in Israel as divine retribution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rizpah.htm">Rizpah</a></b><br>The mother of two of the men who were handed over to the Gibeonites; she later protected their bodies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The former King of Israel whose actions against the Gibeonites led to the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/barley_harvest.htm">Barley Harvest</a></b><br>The time of year when the executions took place, marking a significant agricultural period in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_broken_covenants.htm">The Consequences of Broken Covenants</a></b><br>Breaking covenants, especially those made before God, can have severe consequences.
