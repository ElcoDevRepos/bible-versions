Tekoa was a town in Judah, known for its wise inhabitants. The use of a woman in this context is significant, as women often played pivotal roles in biblical narratives to convey messages or bring about change, such as Esther or Deborah.<p><b>&#8220;Please, may your servant speak a word</b><br>The term "servant" indicates humility and respect, a common approach when addressing a king. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where hierarchy and respect for authority were paramount. The request to "speak a word" suggests the importance of the message she is about to deliver, hinting at the gravity of the situation.<p><b>to my lord the king?&#8221;</b><br>Referring to David as "my lord the king" acknowledges his authority and position as the anointed ruler of Israel. This title is significant, as it reminds the reader of David's God-given role and the expectations of justice and wisdom that come with it. The use of "lord" also has theological implications, as it is a term often used for God, drawing a parallel between divine and earthly authority.<p><b>&#8220;Speak,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>David's willingness to listen demonstrates his openness to counsel and his role as a just ruler. This moment reflects the biblical theme of seeking wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>, "Let the wise listen and add to their learning." David's response also sets the stage for the unfolding of Joab's plan to reconcile him with Absalom, highlighting themes of forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman from the town of Tekoa, chosen by Joab to deliver a parable to King David.
