The crossing of the Jordan River is significant as it symbolizes a transition and a return to God's favor. The Jordan River often represents a boundary or a point of change in biblical narratives, such as the Israelites entering the Promised Land (Joshua 3). The crossing here signifies the restoration of David's kingship and the unity of Israel under his rule.<p><b>and then the king crossed over</b><br>David's crossing of the Jordan follows the people, emphasizing his role as their leader and shepherd. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads His people and goes before them. David's leadership is restored, and his crossing signifies his acceptance and the people's loyalty to him as their rightful king.<p><b>The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him</b><br>Barzillai, a wealthy and aged supporter of David, had provided for the king during his time of need (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>). The kiss and blessing are expressions of gratitude and honor. In the cultural context, a kiss was a sign of respect and affection, while a blessing conveyed favor and goodwill. This interaction highlights the importance of loyalty and support within the community of God's people.<p><b>and Barzillai returned home</b><br>Barzillai's return home to Gilead reflects his contentment and humility. Despite David's offer to care for him in Jerusalem, Barzillai chooses to return to his own land, valuing his heritage and family. This decision underscores the biblical theme of contentment and the significance of one's roots and legacy. Barzillai's actions serve as a reminder of the blessings that come from faithfulness and integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is returning to Jerusalem after the rebellion of his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barzillai.htm">Barzillai</a></b><br>An elderly and wealthy man from Rogelim who supported King David during Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical landmark in Israel, symbolizing transition and change.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were with David, supporting his return to power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crossing.htm">The Crossing</a></b><br>The act of moving from one side of the Jordan River to the other, symbolizing a return to normalcy and restoration of the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_loyalty.htm">The Importance of Loyalty</a></b><br>Barzillai's support for David during a time of crisis exemplifies the value of loyalty and faithfulness.
