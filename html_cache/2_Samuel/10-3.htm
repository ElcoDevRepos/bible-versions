The term "princes" indicates the ruling officials or advisors to Hanun, the new king of the Ammonites. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice where kings relied on a council of nobles or advisors. Hanun had recently succeeded his father Nahash, who had shown kindness to David, possibly during David's time of fleeing from Saul. The political dynamics here are crucial, as the transition of power often led to instability and suspicion.<p><b>&#8220;Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father?</b><br>David's gesture of sending comforters was a diplomatic move, common in ancient times, to express condolences and maintain alliances. The question posed by the Ammonite princes suggests skepticism and distrust, which were not uncommon in international relations of the time. This reflects the broader theme of misunderstanding and misinterpretation of intentions, which can lead to conflict. The respect for one's father was a significant cultural value, and questioning it would have been provocative.<p><b>Has not David instead sent his servants to explore the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?&#8221;</b><br>The suspicion that David's envoys were spies highlights the prevalent fear of espionage and betrayal in ancient warfare. Cities were often fortified, and knowing their defenses was crucial for any potential military campaign. This accusation reflects the broader biblical theme of deceit and the consequences of false assumptions. The idea of overthrowing a city ties into the historical context of territorial expansion and the constant threat of war. This phrase also foreshadows the ensuing conflict between Israel and Ammon, illustrating how mistrust can escalate into open hostility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his leadership and devotion to God.

Proverbs repeatedly warns that the company we keep affects our judgment (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike David, whose counselors like Nathan feared God (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2&#8211;5</a>), these men were political schemers. Their approach echoes Rehoboam&#8217;s later folly of listening to peers over elders (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that rulers are accountable for the counsel they receive (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). Hanun will be held responsible for yielding to suspicion rather than seeking truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just because David has sent you comforters,</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s act was genuine. &#8220;I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). His messengers came as &#8220;comforters,&#8221; paralleling Joseph&#8217;s reassurance to his brothers after Jacob&#8217;s death (<a href="/genesis/50-21.htm">Genesis 50:21</a>) and Job&#8217;s friends who were intended to &#8220;console and comfort him&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s kindness mirrored the covenant faithfulness he had shown Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1&#8211;7</a>) and would later exemplify toward Barzillai (<a href="/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31&#8211;38</a>). His pattern was consistent with God&#8217;s command: &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The princes, however, reinterpret mercy as menace, illustrating Isaiah&#8217;s warning: &#8220;Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do you really believe he is showing respect for your father?</b><p>&#8226; By questioning David&#8217;s motive, they sow doubt in Hanun&#8217;s heart. This tactic mirrors Satan&#8217;s first question to Eve: &#8220;Did God really say&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; They frame David&#8217;s condolence as political posturing, forgetting David&#8217;s public grief over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17&#8211;27</a>). Respect for the dead is a hallmark of David&#8217;s character (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Suspicion replaces gratitude. <a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a> warns, &#8220;If anyone returns evil for good, evil will never depart from his house.&#8221; Hanun is about to fulfill that proverb.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has not David instead sent his servants to explore the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?</b><p>&#8226; The accusation equates David&#8217;s envoys with the spies Joshua sent to Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). Yet David had no history of stealth aggression; he waited for God&#8217;s timing even when he could have seized Saul&#8217;s throne (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4&#8211;7</a>; 26:9&#8211;11).<p>&#8226; The princes assume the worst, much like the elders of Gilead feared Jephthah&#8217;s motives (<a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4&#8211;7</a>). Fear-driven politics leads to pre-emptive hostility: Hanun will humiliate the messengers (<a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>), triggering a war that costs 40,000 Aramean and Ammonite soldiers (<a href="/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a> says the righteous man &#8220;does not slander with his tongue.&#8221; By contrast, these princes slander David, leading their nation into needless bloodshed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a> shows how ungodly counsel distorts a gracious gesture into a perceived threat. David&#8217;s sincere comfort is recast as espionage, revealing the destructive power of suspicion and slander. Hanun&#8217;s failure to discern truth pits Ammon against Israel, demonstrating that rejecting genuine kindness invites divine judgment and unnecessary conflict.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">To search the city.</span>--The capital, and almost the only city of the Ammonites was Rabbah; it was strongly fortified, and a knowledge of its interior would be important to an enemy.
