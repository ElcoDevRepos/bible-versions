The mention of his father, Dodo, and his clan, the Ahohites, provides a genealogical context, emphasizing the importance of lineage and tribal affiliations in ancient Israel. The Ahohites are likely a clan within the tribe of Benjamin, highlighting the diverse tribal support David received. Eleazar's position as "next in command" underscores his valor and leadership qualities, which were essential in the military campaigns against Israel's enemies.<p><b>As one of the three mighty men,</b><br>The "three mighty men" refers to a select group of warriors who were renowned for their extraordinary feats of bravery and skill in battle. This elite trio held a special status among David's forces, often undertaking the most dangerous missions. Their exploits are recorded to inspire courage and faithfulness, serving as examples of loyalty and dedication to God's anointed king. The concept of a select group of warriors is consistent with other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where elite soldiers were often celebrated in royal annals.<p><b>he went with David to taunt the Philistines</b><br>This phrase indicates a proactive and bold approach to warfare, where Eleazar, alongside David, took the initiative to confront the Philistines. The act of taunting suggests a psychological tactic to demoralize the enemy and demonstrate confidence in God's deliverance. The Philistines were a perennial threat to Israel, and their frequent incursions required decisive action. This confrontation reflects the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Philistines, a theme prevalent throughout the books of Samuel.<p><b>who had gathered for battle at Pas-dammim.</b><br>Pas-dammim, also known as Ephes Dammim, is a location in the Valley of Elah, a significant battleground in Israel's history. It is the same area where David previously defeated Goliath, marking it as a place of divine intervention and victory. The gathering of the Philistines at this site suggests their strategic interest in controlling key territories within Israel. Archaeological findings in the region support its identification as a contested area during the period of the united monarchy.<p><b>The men of Israel retreated,</b><br>The retreat of the Israelite forces highlights the dire circumstances and the overwhelming threat posed by the Philistines. This moment of fear and withdrawal sets the stage for Eleazar's heroism, as he stands firm despite the odds. The retreat contrasts with the faith and courage demonstrated by David's mighty men, emphasizing the theme of divine empowerment and the importance of trusting in God's deliverance. This narrative echoes other biblical accounts where God uses a faithful remnant to achieve victory, reinforcing the message of reliance on divine strength rather than human might.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>Son of Dodo, one of David's three mighty warriors.

Scripture&#8217;s repetition of place underscores that spiritual battles often recur; victory must be claimed again by each generation (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The name Pas-dammim means &#8220;boundary of blood,&#8221; foreshadowing the cost of standing for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel&#8217;s Retreat</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The men of Israel retreated&#8221; paints a stark contrast: many withdrew, but Eleazar held firm.

Faithfulness shines brightest when others fall back.<p>&#8226; God uses these moments to exalt obedient servants (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-15</a>, Jonathan and his armor-bearer).

The verse reveals God&#8217;s recognition of individual faithfulness, the honor of serving under divinely appointed authority, and the power of steadfast courage when others flee.

Pas-dammim is the Ephes-dammim of <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>, where Goliath defied the armies of Israel, and was slain by David.<p><span class= "bld">Were gone away</span>--Rather, were <span class= "ital">gathered </span>to battle. So it is translated in the LXX., Vulg., and Syriac, and so the Hebrew requires. The error is a curious one, and seems to have arisen in this way: In <a href="/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a> the mention of the battle in which Shammah was engaged (<a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>) is altogether omitted, and the expression "the people fled from before the Philistines" therefore becomes connected with this battle. Josephus follows that text, and our translators were probably misled by him. Several lines have dropped out from the text in Chronicles. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dodo</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and "Dodo" is a mere correction of the Massorites to bring the name into verbal agreement with <a href="/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>; but in <a href="/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a> he is called <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and we there find him in command of the second division of the army. For "Dodai," however, we ought to read there "Eleazar the son of Dodai." <span class="cmt_word">Ahohite</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">the son of an Ahohite</span>, and probably a member of the family descended from Ahoah, a son of Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-4.htm">1 Chronicles 8:4</a>). He would thus belong to the most warlike tribe of Israel, though not mentioned among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7</a>). He joined him, apparently, at an earlier date. That <span class="cmt_word">were there gathered together.</span> The word "there" implies the previous mention of some place, and though the text in the parallel passage in Chronicles is more corrupt than that before us, it has, nevertheless, preserved the name of the spot where the encounter took place. In Chronicles the name of Shammah is omitted, and his achievement is mixed up in a strange fashion with that of Eleazar. Here the two heroes have each his separate record, and it is only on minor matters that the text there is more correct. Restored from the readings in Chronicles, the narrative is as follows: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up: and he stood (that is, made a stand) and smote," etc. <span class="accented">Pas-dammim</span> is called <span class="accented">Ephes-dammim</span> in <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. It was situated in the valley of Elah, and, as being upon the border, was the scene of numerous conflicts, whence its name, "the boundary of blood." It was there that David slew Goliath. <span class="cmt_word">Were gone away;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">went up</span>; that is, to battle. The idea that the Israelites had fled is taken from the parallel place in Chronicles, where, however, it refers to Shammah's exploit. In vers. 9 and 11 there, the phrase, "the Philistines were gathered together," occurs twice, and the scribe, having accidentally omitted the intervening words, has confused together the exploits of Eleazar and Shammah. In this battle Eleazar withstood the Philistine onset, and smote them till his hand clave to his sword hilt. Many such instances of cramp are recorded, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, in his commentary, quotes one in which the muscles of a warrior's hand could be relaxed, after hard fighting, only by fomentations of hot water. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/23-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next in command was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1435;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
