In the biblical context, strength often refers to both physical and spiritual fortitude. <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> similarly encourages strength and courage, emphasizing reliance on God's presence. The Hebrew concept of strength is not just about personal might but also about trusting in God's power.<p><b>and let us fight bravely</b><br>The call to fight bravely reflects the warrior culture of ancient Israel, where battles were often seen as both physical and spiritual contests. This phrase underscores the importance of valor and determination in the face of adversity. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are urged to put on the full armor of God to stand firm against spiritual challenges.<p><b>for our people</b><br>This highlights the communal aspect of the battle, emphasizing the protection and welfare of the Israelite community. The Israelites often saw themselves as a covenant people, bound together by their relationship with God. This communal focus is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals often have implications for the entire nation, as in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>and for the cities of our God</b><br>The cities mentioned here are not just physical locations but are symbolic of God's promises and presence among His people. Jerusalem, in particular, holds significant theological importance as the city of David and the future site of the Temple. The defense of these cities is seen as a defense of God's honor and His covenant with Israel.<p><b>May the LORD do what is good in His sight.</b><br>This phrase reflects a deep trust in God's sovereignty and goodness. It acknowledges that, despite human efforts, the ultimate outcome rests in God's hands. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states that while humans plan their course, the LORD establishes their steps. It also points to a submission to God's will, reminiscent of Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane in <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>, where He submits to the Father's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David.

He is given command of part of the army to face the Arameans, showing the trust and responsibility placed upon him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation of Israel, often in conflict with them.

Joab felt that the battle was a critical one, and on it depended the welfare and even the safety of "our people" and "the cities of our God."
