This act of pleading is consistent with the biblical tradition of intercession, where individuals seek God's mercy on behalf of others. David's actions echo those of other biblical figures like Moses and Abraham, who also interceded for others. The boy in question is the child born to David and Bathsheba, whose life was threatened as a consequence of David's sin. This moment highlights the personal and communal impact of sin, as well as the hope for divine mercy.<p><b>He fasted</b><br>Fasting in the biblical context is often associated with mourning, repentance, and seeking God's favor. It is a physical expression of humility and dependence on God. In the Old Testament, fasting is seen in times of crisis or when seeking divine intervention, as in the case of Esther or the people of Nineveh. David's fasting signifies his earnestness in seeking God's forgiveness and intervention for the child's life. It is a spiritual discipline that underscores the seriousness of the situation and David's sincere repentance.<p><b>and went into his house</b><br>David's retreat into his house signifies a withdrawal from public life to focus on prayer and supplication. The house, in this context, serves as a private sanctuary where David can express his grief and seek God without distraction. This act of seclusion is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in the New Testament about praying in private, emphasizing sincerity and personal connection with God over public display.<p><b>and spent the night lying in sackcloth on the ground.</b><br>Sackcloth is a coarse material traditionally worn as a sign of mourning and repentance. Lying on the ground further emphasizes David's humility and contrition. This posture of submission is seen throughout scripture, where individuals humble themselves before God in times of distress or repentance, such as Job or the people of Israel during times of national crisis. The use of sackcloth and lying on the ground symbolizes David's acknowledgment of his sin and his total dependence on God's mercy. This act foreshadows the ultimate humility and submission of Jesus Christ, who, though sinless, took on the sins of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is in deep distress over the illness of his child.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord to whom David pleads for mercy and healing for his child.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The son born to David and Bathsheba, who becomes ill as a consequence of David's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fasting_and_prayer.htm">Fasting and Prayer</a></b><br>David's response to the child's illness, demonstrating his repentance and dependence on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The place where David isolates himself to pray and fast, showing his humility and earnestness in seeking God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_fasting.htm">The Power of Prayer and Fasting</a></b><br>David's actions remind us of the importance of earnest prayer and fasting in seeking God's intervention in dire situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_humility.htm">Repentance and Humility</a></b><br>David's posture of lying on the ground signifies his humility and repentance, teaching us the importance of a contrite heart before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>While David pleads for his child's life, the outcome is ultimately in God's hands, reminding us to trust in His sovereign will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>David's situation illustrates that sin has consequences, but it also shows the possibility of restoration through repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god_in_crisis.htm">Seeking God in Crisis</a></b><br>David's immediate turn to God in a time of crisis serves as a model for us to seek divine help and guidance in our own times of trouble.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_12_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 12:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_fasting_sincere_repentance.htm">How does David's fasting in 2 Samuel 12:16 demonstrate sincere repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_David_s_prayer_for_his_child.htm">What can we learn from David's plea for his child's life in prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/David_s_link_to_Psalm_51_s_repentance.htm">How does David's response connect to Psalm 51's theme of repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_David_s_prayer_persistence.htm">How can we apply David's persistence in prayer to our own prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/David_s_lesson_on_seeking_God_s_mercy.htm">What does David's behavior teach about seeking God's mercy during difficult times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_fast_for_his_child.htm">Why did David fast and pray for his child's life in 2 Samuel 12:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_12_16_Prayer_s_impact.htm">How does 2 Samuel 12:16 reflect on the power of prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/David_s_response_in_2_Sam_12_16_on_repentance.htm">What does David's response in 2 Samuel 12:16 teach about repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_esther_4_16's_fast_conflict_historically.htm">Does the three-day fast in Esther 4:16 conflict with known historical or cultural practices of the time?

The word &#8220;pleaded&#8221; shows an urgent, wholehearted intercession&#8212;David believes God can still act (compare <a href="/2_samuel/12-22.htm">2 Samuel 12:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-8.htm">Psalm 30:8</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s appeal flows from genuine repentance already expressed in <a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>.

Like Jesus in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38&#8211;39</a>), David stays before the Father until the matter is settled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a> paints a vivid picture of a repentant king clinging to God&#8217;s mercy. David&#8217;s pleading prayer, fasting, private withdrawal, and physical humility combine to demonstrate absolute dependence on the Lord&#8217;s character and power. Though the child ultimately dies (12:18), the passage teaches that earnest, humble intercession is always the faithful response to sin and its consequences, trusting God&#8217;s righteous and compassionate will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Besought God for the child.</span>--It can hardly be necessary to say that this does not imply any want of submissiveness to God's will on David's part, nor an inordinate love for the child of his guilt. "In the case of a man whose penitence was so earnest and so deep, the prayer for the preservation of his child must have sprung from some other source than excessive love of any created object. His great desire was to avert the stroke as a sign of the wrath of God, in the hope that he might be able to discern, in the preservation of the child, a proof of Divine favour consequent upon the restoration of his fellowship with God. But when the child was dead, he humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, and rested satisfied with His grace, without giving himself up to fruitless pain" (O. von Gerlach, quoted by Keil). Yet David's deep love for the child is not to be overlooked altogether.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... went in.</span> He went, not into the sanctuary, which he did not enter until after the child's death, but into some private room in his own house. There he remained, passing his nights stretched on the ground, and fasting until the seventh day. His fasting does not imply that he took no food during this long interval, but that he abstained from the royal table, and ate so much only as was necessary to maintain life. Now, what was the meaning of this privacy and abstinence? Evidently it was David's acknowledgment, before all his subjects, of his iniquity, and of his sorrow for it. The sickness of the child followed immediately upon Nathan's visit, and we may feel sure that news of his rebuke, and of all that passed between him and the king, ran quickly throughout Jerusalem. And David at once takes the position of a condemned criminal, and humbles himself with that thoroughness which forms so noble a part of his character. Grieved as he was at the child's sickness, and at the mother's sorrow, yet his grief was mainly for his sin; and he was willing that all should know how intense was his shame and self-reproach. And even when the most honourable of the rulers of his household (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>), or, as Ewald thinks, his uncles and elder brethren, came to comfort him, he persists in maintaining an attitude of heart stricken penitence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pleaded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
