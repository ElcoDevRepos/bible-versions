His reign was marked by political instability and conflict with David, who was anointed king over Judah. Ish-bosheth's actions here reflect his attempt to assert authority and legitimacy, as Michal was David's first wife and her return would strengthen his claim to the throne.<p><b>and took Michal</b><br>Michal, the daughter of Saul, was originally given to David as a wife after he defeated Goliath and fulfilled Saul's bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins. Her removal from Paltiel and return to David was not only a personal matter but also a political maneuver, as it symbolized the restoration of David's rights and status within the house of Saul. This act also highlights the lack of agency women had in ancient Israelite society, often being used as pawns in political alliances.<p><b>from her husband Paltiel</b><br>Paltiel, also known as Palti, was given Michal as a wife by Saul after David fled from Saul's court. This marriage was likely intended to sever Michal's ties with David and solidify Saul's opposition to him. Paltiel's emotional response to Michal's removal, as described in the following verses, underscores the personal cost of political decisions and the human element often overlooked in biblical narratives.<p><b>son of Laish</b><br>Laish is mentioned as Paltiel's father, providing a genealogical context that was important in ancient times for establishing identity and social standing. The mention of Laish may also serve to highlight the legitimacy of Paltiel's marriage to Michal, as genealogies were often used to assert claims and rights within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ish-bosheth.htm">Ish-bosheth</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, who was made king over Israel by Abner after Saul's death.
