The act of being "counted off" suggests a military or ceremonial setting, where individuals are selected for a specific purpose. In the context of ancient Israel, such counting often preceded a battle or significant event, reflecting the importance of order and structure in military engagements.<p><b>twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul,</b><br>The number twelve is significant in biblical terms, often representing completeness or the twelve tribes of Israel. Here, it signifies a representative group from the tribe of Benjamin, aligning with Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. This highlights the division within Israel after Saul's death, with some tribes supporting Ish-bosheth as king. The tribe of Benjamin, Saul's own tribe, naturally aligns with his son, indicating loyalty and familial ties. This division sets the stage for the conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David.<p><b>and twelve for David.</b><br>Similarly, the twelve men for David represent his claim to leadership and the support he has garnered, particularly from the tribe of Judah. David's selection of twelve men mirrors the completeness and divine favor often associated with this number, suggesting his legitimate claim to kingship. This confrontation between the two groups symbolizes the larger struggle for the throne of Israel, with David's men representing a new era and divine anointing, as David had been chosen by God through the prophet Samuel. This foreshadows David's eventual unification of the tribes and establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its warriors.

The verse shows human leaders driving events, yet God&#8217;s sovereign choice of David remains unshaken. While Benjamin clings to the fading dynasty of Saul, David patiently entrusts his cause to the Lord. The scene foreshadows God&#8217;s ultimate purpose: to gather all His people under the true and better David&#8212;Jesus Christ&#8212;who will end rivalry and rule in perfect peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1467;&#1430;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;qu&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
