Jerusalem, the city of David, was the political and spiritual center of Israel. Mephibosheth's journey from Jerusalem to meet King David signifies his loyalty and respect for the king. The context is the return of David to Jerusalem after Absalom's rebellion. Mephibosheth's actions are significant because they demonstrate his allegiance to David despite the political turmoil. Jerusalem, being the capital, was a place of significant political activity, and Mephibosheth's presence there indicates his connection to the royal family.<p><b>who asked him,</b><br>David's inquiry shows his concern and personal interest in Mephibosheth. This interaction highlights David's character as a king who is attentive to the individuals in his kingdom. The question also sets the stage for addressing the misunderstanding caused by Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, who had previously deceived David about Mephibosheth's loyalty. This moment is crucial for clarifying Mephibosheth's intentions and loyalty.<p><b>&#8220;Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?&#8221;</b><br>David's question directly addresses the issue of loyalty and support during his time of need. Mephibosheth's absence during David's flight from Absalom is a matter of concern for the king. This question reflects the cultural importance of loyalty and support for a king, especially during times of crisis. In the broader biblical narrative, loyalty to God's anointed king is a recurring theme, and Mephibosheth's response will reveal his true allegiance. This moment also foreshadows the ultimate loyalty and faithfulness expected of believers to Christ, the true King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

The verse reminds believers that covenant bonds demand steadfastness, even when circumstances or accusations make faithfulness costly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Wentest not thou with me?</span>--David had heard and believed the story of Mephibosheth's ingratitude and treachery (<a href="/context/2_samuel/16-3.htm" title="And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he stays at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.">2Samuel 16:3-4</a>), and his present remonstrance is so gentle and kindly as to show that Mephibosheth's appearance at once produced an impression, and suggested in David's mind a doubt of the truth of what Ziba had told him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king.</span> This certainly looks as if the meeting took place at Jerusalem, and apparently when David had reached the royal palace (see ver. 30). But what, then, is meant in ver. 24 by his "going down" to meet the king? If, too, he had been at Jerusalem all the while, how could he come there? Some, therefore, translate, "Then Jerusalem came to meet the king" - a possible, but not a natural, rendering, nor one that agrees with ver. 30. Others consider that he had withdrawn to his house in the highlands of Benjamin at Gibeah of Saul; but David had given these lands to Ziba, and the crippled Mephibesheth would have met with rough treatment had he endeavoured to contest the ownership. The Arabic Version reads. "when he came from Jerusalem;" but it is not confirmed by any trustworthy authorities. The view of Kimchi is probably right, that Mephibosheth did go down to the Jordan fords to meet David, and certainly his duty required of him no less. He had been slandered and ill used, but the king believed him to be guilty, and regarded him with displeasure. To have remained, therefore, at home when all Judah and half Israel had gone to welcome David back, would have been culpable remissness. And though he was lame, yet the ride was not so long as to be very fatiguing. But he did not rush through the river, as Shimei and his thousand men had done; and when David had crossed, there was too much going on for him to get an audience. He followed, therefore, in David's suite; but in Jerusalem the meeting actually took place. Thus the verses briefly record different facts: ver. 24 that Mephibosheth went with the vast crowd to welcome the king back; ver. 25 that in due time, in Jerusalem, the explanation was given, and Mephibosheth restored to favour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
