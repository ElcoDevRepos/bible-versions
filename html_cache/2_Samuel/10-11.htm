The Arameans, also known as Syrians, were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. This phrase highlights Joab's strategic planning and reliance on his brother Abishai, showing the importance of unity and support in warfare. The Arameans' strength is a reminder of the constant threats Israel faced from surrounding nations, emphasizing the need for divine assistance, as seen in other battles where God intervened on behalf of Israel (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p><b>said Joab,</b><br>Joab, a key military leader under King David, is known for his bravery and tactical acumen. His leadership is crucial in the narrative of David's reign, often acting decisively in battle. Joab's role in this context underscores the importance of wise and courageous leadership in achieving victory. His character is complex, as he is both a loyal servant to David and a man of violence, reflecting the dual nature of leadership in a fallen world.<p><b>then you will come to my rescue.</b><br>Joab's statement to his brother Abishai reflects a mutual dependence and trust between the two leaders. This cooperation is essential for the success of their military campaign. The concept of rescue and support is a recurring theme in Scripture, where believers are called to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate rescue provided by Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from sin and death.<p><b>And if the Ammonites are too strong for you,</b><br>The Ammonites, descendants of Lot, were frequent adversaries of Israel. Their strength in battle posed a significant threat, necessitating a strategic alliance between Joab and Abishai. This phrase highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighbors, rooted in historical and familial tensions. The Ammonites' opposition to Israel is a reminder of the spiritual battles believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>then I will come to your rescue.</b><br>Joab's commitment to assist Abishai if needed demonstrates the principle of mutual aid and solidarity. This reflects the biblical call for believers to support one another in times of trial (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>). The idea of rescue is central to the biblical narrative, culminating in the redemptive work of Christ, who rescues humanity from the power of sin. Joab's promise to rescue Abishai mirrors the assurance of God's deliverance for His people, as seen throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and leadership.

and the men with him, being only ordinary troops, would be disheartened by Joab's failure, so that without extraordinary bravery on their leader's part, they would give way, and all would be lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Arameans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_758.htm">Strong's 758: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aram -- Syria</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are too strong</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1494;&#1463;&#1444;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(te&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;zaq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2388.htm">Strong's 2388: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fasten upon, to seize, be strong, obstinate, to bind, restrain, conquer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for me,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;men&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
