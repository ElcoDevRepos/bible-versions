This encounter occurs during a civil conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David. The setting is significant as it highlights the division within Israel after Saul's death. Abner's call to Joab is a plea for peace, reflecting the tension and the desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed among fellow Israelites.<p><b>Must the sword devour forever?:</b><br>This phrase uses metaphorical language to describe the ongoing violence and destruction caused by the conflict. The "sword" symbolizes war and its consuming nature. The question implies a recognition of the futility and endless cycle of violence, echoing sentiments found in other scriptures that lament the destructive nature of war (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>).<p><b>Do you not realize that this will only end in bitterness?:</b><br>Abner warns of the inevitable outcome of continued conflict&#8212;bitterness and sorrow. This reflects a common biblical theme where prolonged strife leads to deep-seated resentment and division. The historical context of Israel's tribal tensions underscores the potential for long-lasting enmity if reconciliation is not pursued.<p><b>How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?:</b><br>Abner appeals to Joab's sense of kinship and shared identity among the Israelites. The term "brothers" emphasizes the familial bonds that should unite rather than divide them. This plea for cessation of hostilities is a call to recognize their common heritage and to seek peace. It resonates with the biblical principle of unity among God's people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, which speaks of the goodness of dwelling together in unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, a key figure in the power struggle following Saul's death.

As in <a href="/1_samuel/26-14.htm">1 Samuel 26:14</a>, voices carry across the battlefield; words still have power to restrain bloodshed.<p>&#8226; Scripture reminds us that &#8220;a gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>), and even in war God can use a timely appeal to stay the hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must the sword devour forever?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The sword&#8221; is a vivid personification of relentless violence, common in the Old Testament&#8212;see <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8</a>.<p>&#8226; Abner frames the question rhetorically, exposing the futility of endless revenge. He implies that unchecked retaliation becomes an appetite that is never satisfied.<p>&#8226; The literal sword had already &#8220;devoured&#8221; many that day (<a href="/2_samuel/2-17.htm">2 Samuel 2:17</a>). Abner&#8217;s words acknowledge a moral boundary that had been crossed and begs Joab to recognize it as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you not realize that this will only end in bitterness?</b><p>&#8226; Civil conflict among Israelites produces lasting &#8220;bitterness,&#8221; not victory.

Later, David himself will lament similar division: &#8220;You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By God&#8217;s design the tribes were to defend each other (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>), not consume each other (<a href="/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a> gives the same warning to the church).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abner&#8217;s cry in <a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26</a> is a Spirit-preserved plea for restraint in a moment when vengeance threatened to overrule covenant brotherhood. He asks Joab to see the endless, bitter cycle that unchecked violence unleashes and to order his men to halt the pursuit of fellow Israelites. The verse teaches that even amid conflict God expects His people to remember their kinship, recognize the destructive appetite of vengeance, and choose restraint so that bitterness does not take root.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Abner called to Joab.</span>--It may be that Abner was already considering the expediency of transferring his allegiance to the house of David, or, at least, had had enough experience of Ish-bosheth to see that it would be impossible to unite the tribes under his sway. At all events, his sense of the disastrous effects of civil war was doubtless quickened by his own defeat and present danger.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end!</span> The Vulgate renders this, "Art thou not aware that desperation is dangerous?" This is a very obvious truth, but probably Abner had in his mind something more statesmanlike. The struggle was for the empire over all Israel, and whoever won would be king over both sides. But every man slain meant a blood feud, which would continue even after the kingdom was united; and Abner probably felt that his own slaughter of Asahel that day would render his position in David's realm difficult and dangerous. Among the Arab tribes quarrels are very common, but bloodshed rare, because of the blood feud which follows. Moderation was thus necessary on both sides, while cruelty and the immoderate use of victory would sow the seeds of future trouble. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
