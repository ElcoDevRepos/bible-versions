Jerusalem, known as the City of David, was the capital established by David after he conquered it from the Jebusites. This city held significant importance as the location of the Ark of the Covenant and later the Temple. Absalom's presence in Jerusalem indicates his proximity to the seat of power, which is crucial for understanding his later actions in attempting to usurp the throne.<p><b>two years</b><br>The two-year period signifies a time of unresolved tension and estrangement between Absalom and his father, King David. This duration reflects a significant period of waiting and potential bitterness, as Absalom was not fully restored to his previous status despite being allowed to return to Jerusalem. The number two in biblical terms can sometimes symbolize division or separation, which is fitting given the strained relationship between father and son.<p><b>without seeing the face of the king</b><br>This phrase highlights the continued estrangement between Absalom and David. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeing the king's face was a sign of favor and acceptance. Absalom's inability to see David suggests a lack of reconciliation and unresolved conflict. This separation foreshadows the eventual rebellion led by Absalom against his father. The phrase also underscores the theme of familial discord, a recurring issue in David's household, as seen in the earlier conflict between Amnon and Tamar. The absence of direct communication between David and Absalom during this time contributes to the tragic unfolding of events in the subsequent chapters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.

Joab&#8217;s intervention (14:1&#8211;23) secured his return, fulfilling David&#8217;s longing yet leaving issues unresolved.<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s continued life points to God&#8217;s mercy in sparing him despite his murder of Amnon (13:28&#8211;33).
