His actions often reflect a mix of loyalty and self-interest. In this context, Joab orchestrates a plan to reconcile King David with his estranged son Absalom. This reflects Joab's understanding of the political and familial tensions within the kingdom. The phrase "to bring about this change of affairs" indicates Joab's strategic intervention to alter the current state of estrangement between David and Absalom, highlighting his role as a mediator. This action can be seen as a reflection of the complex dynamics of leadership and loyalty in ancient Israel.<p><b>but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God</b><br>The comparison of David's wisdom to that of an "angel of God" underscores the high regard in which David's discernment and judgment are held. In biblical literature, angels are often seen as messengers of God, possessing divine insight and understanding. This phrase suggests that David's wisdom is perceived as divinely inspired, aligning with the biblical portrayal of David as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The reference to angelic wisdom also connects to the broader biblical theme of divine guidance and the role of leaders as instruments of God's will.<p><b>to know everything that happens in the land.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the expectation of a king to be fully aware of the affairs of his kingdom. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king was not only a political leader but also a judge and protector of his people. The ability to "know everything that happens in the land" implies a comprehensive understanding of both the political and social dynamics at play. This expectation of omniscience is echoed in other biblical texts, where leaders are called to be vigilant and discerning (<a href="/proverbs/20-8.htm">Proverbs 20:8</a>). It also foreshadows the messianic expectation of a ruler who will reign with perfect justice and knowledge, a role ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ as the omniscient King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his strategic mind and sometimes ruthless actions.

For <span class="cmt_word">in the earth,</span> translate <span class="accented">in the land.</span> The Hebrew has no means of distinguishing the wider and narrower significations of the word; but while the king would be flattered by the supposition that he knew all that happened in his dominions, the assertion that he knew all that was done in all the world was too broad and general to be agreeable. The Authorized Version has been misled by the thought of what an angel might know; but while it was a compliment to ascribe to the king an angel's intelligence in his own sphere, it would have been bad taste and unmeaning to ascribe to him omniscience. Nay, it is an assumption without proof that even an angel knows "all things that are in the earth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1445;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
