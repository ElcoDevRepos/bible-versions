This crossing of the Jordan River marks a significant moment of transition and escape for David and his followers. The Jordan River often symbolizes a boundary or a point of transition in biblical narratives, such as when the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 3). This crossing can be seen as a parallel to that earlier event, highlighting themes of deliverance and divine guidance. The urgency of the situation is underscored by the fact that David and his people had to move quickly to avoid Absalom's forces. The Jordan River, a natural barrier, provided a temporary refuge and a strategic advantage for David.<p><b>By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan.</b><br>The phrase "by daybreak" indicates the urgency and efficiency with which David and his followers acted. The cover of night provided them with protection from being detected by Absalom's forces. This swift and complete crossing signifies the unity and loyalty of David's followers, as well as their trust in his leadership. The complete crossing by daybreak also suggests divine favor and protection, as it was crucial for their survival. This event can be seen as a type of Christ, where David, a foreshadowing of Jesus, leads his people to safety and deliverance. The crossing of the Jordan can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual transition and renewal, themes that are echoed in the New Testament with the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

Just as shepherd and flock stay together, David keeps moving forward in faith, trusting God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.
