The king in question is King David, who is approached by a woman from Tekoa. This encounter is orchestrated by Joab, David's military commander, to persuade the king to reconcile with his estranged son Absalom. The question "What troubles you?" reflects David's role as a judge and leader, responsible for the welfare of his people. It echoes the biblical theme of a king's duty to administer justice and compassion, reminiscent of Solomon's wisdom in <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>. The king's inquiry also highlights the importance of addressing grievances and seeking understanding, a principle found throughout the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; she said,</b><br>The woman's response begins with "Indeed," indicating her acknowledgment of the king's authority and her readiness to present her case. This interaction is part of a carefully crafted narrative by Joab, using the woman's story as an allegory to mirror David's own situation with Absalom. The use of a parable or story to convey a deeper truth is a common biblical technique, seen in Nathan's confrontation with David in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>. This method allows for reflection and self-examination, encouraging the listener to discern the underlying message.<p><b>&#8220;I am a widow,</b><br>The woman's claim of widowhood places her in a vulnerable social position, as widows in ancient Israel were often marginalized and dependent on the community for support. The Law of Moses provided specific protections for widows, emphasizing the need for justice and care (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17-21</a>). Her status as a widow evokes sympathy and underscores the theme of justice for the oppressed, a recurring motif in the prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>. This appeal to the king's sense of justice is strategic, as it aligns with his responsibility to protect the defenseless.<p><b>for my husband is dead.</b><br>The statement of her husband's death reinforces her plight and the urgency of her situation. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's identity and security were closely tied to her husband. The loss of a husband meant not only emotional grief but also potential economic hardship and social instability. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of God's concern for the vulnerable, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, where God is described as a "father to the fatherless, a defender of widows." The woman's predicament serves as a catalyst for David to reflect on his own familial relationships and the need for reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, known for his heart after God, yet also for his personal and familial struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman from the town of Tekoa, used by Joab to convey a message to King David through a parable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who orchestrates the woman's appeal to David to bring about reconciliation with Absalom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tekoa.htm">Tekoa</a></b><br>A town in Judah, known for its wise inhabitants, including the prophet Amos.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, estranged from his father after killing his brother Amnon, which sets the stage for the woman's plea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_parables.htm">The Power of Parables</a></b><br>Parables are a powerful tool for conveying truth and prompting introspection.

David pauses to draw out the woman&#8217;s heart before rendering judgment, mirroring God&#8217;s own concern for the afflicted (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>). Similar scenes appear when Elkanah asks Hannah, &#8220;Why is your heart sad?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>) and when Jesus engages the blind man, &#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a>). In every case, the question invites honesty and exposes the real need, reminding us that the Lord likewise invites us to cast every anxiety on Him (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king asked her</b><p>Though David holds absolute authority, he lowers himself to listen. This models righteous leadership:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-14.htm">Proverbs 29:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;A king who judges the poor with truth&#8212;his throne will be established forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>&#8212;David &#8220;administered justice and righteousness for all his people.&#8221;<p>The episode foreshadows the greater King who welcomes all petitioners (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; she said</b><p>The woman responds with respectful candor, illustrating the freedom to speak openly before a just ruler. Compare Esther&#8217;s measured plea before Xerxes (<a href="/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3&#8211;4</a>) and Abigail&#8217;s frank address to David (<a href="/1_samuel/25-24.htm">1 Samuel 25:24&#8211;31</a>). Truthful dialogue opens the door for mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am a widow&#8221;</b><p>Her status immediately signals vulnerability. Scripture repeatedly commands special care for widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). By highlighting her widowhood first, she appeals to David&#8217;s sense of covenantal responsibility and to God&#8217;s character as &#8220;a defender of widows&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for my husband is dead</b><p>The statement grounds her plea in undeniable loss. Death has removed her protector and provider, leaving her exposed. Ruth faced a similar plight after Elimelech died (<a href="/ruth/1-3.htm">Ruth 1:3</a>), and the prophet&#8217;s widow cried to Elisha when creditors threatened her sons (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>). Throughout Scripture, God moves toward those crushed by death&#8217;s fallout, offering hope and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/2_samuel/14-5.htm">2 Samuel 14:5</a> highlights a movement of compassionate justice: the king&#8217;s willing ear, the petitioner&#8217;s honest voice, and the urgent need produced by loss. Together they showcase the heart of God, who listens, cares, and acts on behalf of the vulnerable, calling His people&#8212;and especially those in authority&#8212;to do the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">troubles you?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
