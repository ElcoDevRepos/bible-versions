The context is a parable-like story orchestrated by Joab to persuade David to reconcile with his estranged son Absalom. The "people of God" refers to the Israelites, highlighting the communal impact of David's personal decisions. The woman's question challenges David's actions, suggesting that his decisions have broader implications for the nation. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders' actions affect their people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13-14</a>, where Rehoboam's decision impacts the kingdom.<p><b>When the king says this,</b><br>The woman refers to a hypothetical situation presented to David, which mirrors his own circumstances. This technique of using parables or indirect stories to reveal truth is seen elsewhere in scripture, such as Nathan's parable to David in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>. It is a method to provoke self-reflection and realization of one's own faults.<p><b>does he not convict himself,</b><br>The phrase suggests self-incrimination, as David's judgment on the hypothetical situation indirectly condemns his own actions regarding Absalom. This mirrors the biblical theme of self-awareness and repentance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, where David acknowledges his sin. The concept of self-conviction is also echoed in <a href="/romans/2.htm">Romans 2:1</a>, where Paul speaks of judging others while doing the same things.<p><b>since he has not brought back his own banished son?</b><br>This refers to Absalom, who was in exile after killing his brother Amnon. The cultural context of banishment in ancient Israel often involved familial and tribal tensions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a> with Hagar and Ishmael. The return of a banished individual can symbolize forgiveness and restoration, themes central to the gospel message. Absalom's situation foreshadows the reconciliation offered through Christ, who brings back the "banished" into the family of God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army who orchestrates a plan to reconcile David with his estranged son, Absalom, by using a wise woman from Tekoa.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Wise Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A woman chosen by Joab to present a parable to King David, aiming to persuade him to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel, who is in a moral and emotional conflict regarding his son Absalom, who has been banished for killing his brother Amnon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who is in exile after avenging his sister Tamar by killing Amnon, David's other son.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tekoa.htm">Tekoa</a></b><br>A town in Judah, known for its wise inhabitants, from where the woman who speaks to David is brought.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_parables.htm">The Power of Parables</a></b><br>Parables can be powerful tools for revealing truth and prompting self-reflection.

By exposing the king&#8217;s hidden strategy she urges him to see the bigger picture: the welfare of &#8220;the people of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s refusal to deal with Absalom&#8217;s exile has left the nation in limbo&#8212;no clear heir, unresolved blood-guilt, simmering unrest (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37-38</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly links a leader&#8217;s private decisions to public blessing or harm (<a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6-10</a>). The woman implies that David&#8217;s passivity is itself &#8220;a thing&#8230;against the people of God,&#8221; because justice delayed for Absalom is justice denied for Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When the king says this</b><p>&#8226; Moments earlier David had vowed, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/14-11.htm">2 Samuel 14:11</a>). That gracious promise, offered to a stranger, proves the standard by which his own actions must now be measured (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The woman effectively asks, &#8220;If you can grant mercy in a fictional case, why not in the real one that confronts your throne?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Leadership integrity requires that the king&#8217;s pronouncements align with his personal conduct (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does he not convict himself</b><p>&#8226; By applying mercy to the woman&#8217;s invented situation while withholding it from Absalom, David has become &#8220;condemned by the very words&#8221; of his mouth (<a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>; <a href="/luke/19-22.htm">Luke 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This self-condemnation mirrors earlier moments in David&#8217;s life: after Nathan&#8217;s parable of the ewe lamb, he declared judgment on the rich man, only to hear, &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5-7</a>). God often uses parables to bring hidden sin into the light (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; <a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s conscience is being stirred toward repentance, a pivotal step before he can rightly restore his son and his kingdom (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since he has not brought back his own banished son?</b><p>&#8226; Absalom had fled after killing Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28-29</a>) and now lived in Geshur&#8212;estranged, unreconciled, yet still the crown prince (<a href="/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The Law made provision for those who shed blood to find refuge and ultimately return once atonement was secured (<a href="/numbers/35-25.htm">Numbers 35:25-28</a>). David, as king and father, possessed the authority to facilitate that return, but fear and grief kept him inactive (<a href="/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The woman&#8217;s statement presses David to embody the covenant character of God, &#8220;who devises ways so that a banished one does not remain banished from Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>). Divine mercy toward the estranged sets the pattern for human mercy (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Restoring Absalom would not excuse the crime; it would open the door for justice, reconciliation, and stability in Israel, foreshadowing the ultimate reconciliation God provides through His Son (<a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The wise woman&#8217;s words skillfully hold a mirror to David: his merciful verdict for a stranger exposes his failure to extend the same mercy to Absalom. By neglecting to restore his &#8220;banished son,&#8221; the king endangers God&#8217;s people and condemns himself by his own standard. The passage challenges every reader to align personal actions with professed principles, demonstrating the same reconciling heart that God continually extends to the estranged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Against the people of God.</span>--This phrase, according to constant usage, can only mean <span class= "ital">Israel. </span>The woman finds that the time has come when she must show the king that he stands condemned for his conduct towards Absalom by his own decision. She does this cautiously, and her language is therefore somewhat obscure; she rather hints at than plainly expresses what she wants to say.
