This emotional turmoil reflects the complex relationship between David and Absalom, marked by rebellion and familial strife. David's reaction is not just as a king but as a father, highlighting the personal loss and grief that transcends his royal duties.<p><b>and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept.</b><br>The chamber over the gate was a private place, often used for mourning or solitude. Gates were significant in ancient cities, serving as places of judgment and public gathering. David's choice to retreat to this chamber indicates his need for privacy in his grief, away from the eyes of his people and soldiers. This setting underscores the depth of his sorrow, as he seeks a secluded place to express his emotions.<p><b>And as he walked, he cried out,</b><br>David's movement while crying out suggests restlessness and an inability to find comfort. His grief is active and consuming, showing the intensity of his emotional state. This behavior is reminiscent of other biblical figures who express deep lament, such as Job or Jeremiah, indicating a profound personal and spiritual crisis.<p><b>&#8220;O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom!</b><br>The repetition of "my son" emphasizes David's deep paternal love and the personal nature of his loss. Despite Absalom's rebellion, David's lament reveals his unconditional love and the pain of losing a child. This echoes the biblical theme of a father's love, which can be seen as a type of God's love for His children, despite their rebellion.<p><b>If only I had died instead of you,</b><br>David's wish to have died in Absalom's place reflects the sacrificial love of a parent. This sentiment can be seen as a foreshadowing of the sacrificial love of Christ, who died for humanity. David's expression of substitutionary desire highlights the depth of his love and regret, paralleling the ultimate sacrifice made by Jesus.<p><b>O Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221;</b><br>The lament concludes with a final, poignant repetition, underscoring the personal and familial tragedy. David's grief is not just for the loss of a son but also for the lost potential of reconciliation and restoration. This moment captures the heartache of broken relationships and the longing for redemption, themes prevalent throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is deeply grieved by the death of his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who rebelled against his father, leading to a civil war in Israel.

His sorrow, too, may have gained poignancy from the thought--which must often have come to him during the progress of this rebellion--that all this sin and wrong took its occasion from his own great sin. Yet David was criminally weak at this crisis in allowing the feelings of the father completely to outweigh the duties of the monarch.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king was much moved.</span> The Hebrew word properly refers to agitation of body. A violent trembling seized the king, and, rising, he went up to the guard chamber over the two gates, that he might give free course to his lamentation. The whole is told so vividly that we can scarcely doubt that we have here the words of one who was present at this pathetic scene, who saw the tremor which shook David's body, and watched him as he crept slowly up the stairs, uttering words of intense sorrow. And it was conscience which smote him; for his own "sin had found him out."
