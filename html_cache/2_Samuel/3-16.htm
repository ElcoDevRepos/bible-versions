Michal had been given to David as a wife, but Saul later gave her to Paltiel. The emotional attachment Paltiel had for Michal is evident as he follows her, highlighting the personal cost of political maneuvers in ancient Israel. This reflects the complex family dynamics and political alliances of the time.<p><b>weeping all the way to Bahurim</b><br>Bahurim was a village near the Mount of Olives, on the road from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley. The mention of weeping underscores the deep sorrow and personal loss experienced by Paltiel. This emotional display contrasts with the often political and strategic nature of marriages in the ancient Near East. Bahurim is also mentioned in other biblical narratives, such as when Shimei curses David (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>).<p><b>Then Abner said to him, &#8220;Go back.&#8221;</b><br>Abner, the commander of Saul's army, was instrumental in negotiating Michal's return to David as part of a political alliance. His authority and command over the situation are evident as he instructs Paltiel to return. This reflects the power dynamics at play, where personal desires are often overridden by political necessity. Abner's role in this narrative foreshadows his later defection to David's side.<p><b>So he returned home.</b><br>Paltiel's compliance with Abner's command highlights the limited agency individuals had in the face of political decisions. His return home signifies the end of his relationship with Michal, emphasizing the theme of loss and the impact of political decisions on personal lives. This moment also serves as a reminder of the broader narrative of David's rise to power and the fulfillment of God's promise to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Daughter of King Saul and first wife of David, who was given to another man, Paltiel, by her father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paltiel.htm">Paltiel</a></b><br>Michal's second husband, who deeply loved her and followed her weeping when she was taken back to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army who defected to David's side and facilitated Michal's return to David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who demanded Michal's return as part of his negotiations with Abner.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bahurim.htm">Bahurim</a></b><br>A location on the route from Paltiel's home to David, where Abner instructed Paltiel to return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_human_relationships.htm">The Complexity of Human Relationships</a></b><br>The account of Michal, David, and Paltiel illustrates the tangled web of human emotions and relationships, reminding us of the need for compassion and understanding in our interactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_political_decisions.htm">The Consequences of Political Decisions</a></b><br>Abner's actions were politically motivated, showing how political decisions can deeply affect personal lives.

But it is to be remembered that she was not rightfully his wife, and that David's claim was prior as well as better. According to <a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a>, Phaltiel was of Gallim, a place thought, from the connection in which it is mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>, to have been in Benjamin, and not far from Gibeah; but he had probably crossed the Jordan with the adherents of the house of Saul. Bahurim was on the road from the Mount of Olives to the Jordan valley, and hence on the way from Mahanaim to Hebron, and a long distance from the former. It was the residence of Shimei (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.">2Samuel 16:5</a>), and the place of concealment of David's messengers, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (<a href="/2_samuel/17-18.htm" title="Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.">2Samuel 17:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her husband went with her along weeping behind her.</span> "Along weeping" is a very awkward rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "going and weeping." The Revised Version is far better, "weeping as he went and followed her." Phaltiel had been Michal's husband for eight or nine years, and his sorrow at losing her excites sympathy for them both. They had evidently loved one another, and she was now going to be but one of many wives; and though David may have desired her restoration because he valued her and cherished the remembrance of their youthful affection, yet there was a large admixture of political motive in his conduct. At Gallim she had been Phaltiel's one jewel, and had been loved for her own sake; at Hebron she would have many rivals. But women of royal rank have often to pay the price of sacrificed affections for the ends of statecraft. Near <span class="cmt_word">Bahurim</span>, on the road from Jerusalem to Gilgal, in the valley of the Jordan, the convoy approached the borders of Judah, and Abner will not allow the weeping husband to enter David's dominions. Painful as was his fate, he had himself done wrong in marrying another man's wife; and if he was weeping now, we may well believe that David had felt equal anguish when Michal was torn from him and sold to another, - for fathers in those days received instead of giving a dowry upon the marriage of their daughters. Saul in this matter was most to blame, and if he had not committed this wrong, David might never have sought an evil solace in multiplying to himself other wives <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Her husband</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
