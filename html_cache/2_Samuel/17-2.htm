The context is Absalom's rebellion against his father, King David. David, having fled Jerusalem, is in a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. This mirrors other biblical instances where enemies sought to exploit moments of weakness, such as Amalek's attack on the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>. The idea of striking when an opponent is weak is a common military tactic, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and preparedness in spiritual warfare (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>I will throw him into a panic,</b><br>Ahithophel's plan involves creating confusion and fear, a tactic often used in warfare to destabilize and demoralize the enemy. Panic can lead to disorganization and defeat, as seen in the story of Gideon in <a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-22</a>, where God used confusion to defeat the Midianites. This reflects the spiritual truth that fear and panic can lead to poor decision-making and a loss of faith, contrasting with the peace and confidence found in trusting God (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p><b>and all the people with him will flee;</b><br>Ahithophel predicts that once David is thrown into panic, his followers will abandon him. This highlights the importance of strong leadership and the loyalty of followers. Historically, the loyalty of David's men was tested during Absalom's rebellion, yet many remained faithful. This can be compared to the scattering of Jesus' disciples at His arrest (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>), illustrating human frailty and the need for divine strength.<p><b>I will strike down only the king.</b><br>Ahithophel's plan focuses on eliminating David alone, believing that his death would end the conflict. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of targeting leaders to quickly resolve battles. Theologically, it underscores the significance of the king as the anointed leader, a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King. The focus on the king's life parallels the prophetic anticipation of the Messiah, who would be struck down for the salvation of His people (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to King David who later defected to Absalom.

Remaining alert and dependent on the Lord guards against such calculated assaults (<a href="/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will throw him into a panic</b><p>&#8226; Fear can unravel even seasoned warriors. Ahithophel expects sudden terror to spread through David&#8217;s camp, much like the divinely sent confusion that toppled the Philistines before Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15-20</a>) or the dread that froze Midian (<a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Panic magnifies weakness. David knew this dynamic when he prayed, &#8220;Let all my enemies be ashamed and terrified&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a>). Ahithophel tries to weaponize it for evil, counting on shock and awe rather than protracted battle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the people with him will flee</b><p>&#8226; Once panic starts, loyalty fractures. Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy&#8212;&#8220;Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>)&#8212;mirrors Ahithophel&#8217;s calculation. Jesus later cited this truth about His own disciples (<a href="/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s strategist banks on the demoralizing effect seen when Israel fled before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-24.htm">1 Samuel 17:24</a>) or when the northern armies deserted Pekah (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>). Without firm leadership, crowds often scatter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will strike down only the king</b><p>&#8226; By isolating the target, Ahithophel aims to end the conflict swiftly: &#8220;I would bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. You seek the life of only one man&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/17-3.htm">2 Samuel 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar tactics surface when Ben-hadad ordered his chariot commanders, &#8220;Fight only the king of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>), and when Syria focused on Joram alone (<a href="/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God overrules: Hushai&#8217;s counsel delays the plan, David is preserved, and Ahithophel&#8217;s scheme collapses (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14, 23</a>). The Lord &#8220;frustrates the plans of the crafty&#8221; (<a href="/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2</a> records a shrewd but ruthless plan: attack David when exhausted, unleash panic, scatter his followers, and execute only the king. The verse exposes how human wisdom plots against God&#8217;s anointed, but the broader passage shows the Lord turning that wisdom to folly. Believers today can draw confidence that, even when enemies exploit weakness, God&#8217;s sovereign protection stands firm and His purposes prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Will make him afraid.</span>--This translation is hardly strong enough.
