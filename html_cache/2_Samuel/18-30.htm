David's command to "move aside" reflects his authority and the urgency of the situation. The context is a time of great personal and national turmoil, as David has just received news of Absalom's death. This phrase highlights David's need to process the information and make decisions without distraction. The king's authority is a recurring theme in the Bible, reflecting God's ultimate sovereignty. David's kingship is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King and Shepherd of His people.<p><b>&#8220;and stand here.&#8221;</b><br>David instructs the messenger to stand aside, indicating a pause or a need for space. This reflects the cultural practice of showing respect and waiting for the king's further instructions. The act of standing aside can symbolize waiting on God's timing and direction, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. It also suggests a moment of reflection or contemplation, which is significant given the gravity of the news about Absalom. In a broader biblical context, standing before a king can be seen as a metaphor for standing before God, awaiting His judgment or mercy.<p><b>So he stepped aside.</b><br>The messenger's obedience to David's command demonstrates respect for authority and the proper protocol in the royal court. This action reflects the cultural norms of the time, where obedience to the king was expected and necessary for maintaining order. The messenger's compliance can be seen as a parallel to the believer's call to obedience to God's commands. In the broader narrative, this moment of stepping aside allows David the space to grieve and process the news, highlighting the human aspect of leadership and the personal cost of conflict. This obedience also foreshadows the ultimate obedience of Christ, who submitted to the Father's will even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, who is dealing with the aftermath of the battle against his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>The son of Zadok the priest, who brings news to King David about the battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cushite.htm">Cushite</a></b><br>Another messenger who brings news to David, arriving after Ahimaaz.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle_of_ephraim's_wood.htm">Battle of Ephraim's Wood</a></b><br>The location of the battle where Absalom's forces were defeated by David's men.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who led a rebellion against his father and was killed in the battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_authority.htm">Obedience to Authority</a></b><br>Ahimaaz's response to King David's command demonstrates the importance of respecting and obeying authority, even when it may not align with personal desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_and_timing.htm">Patience and Timing</a></b><br>The instruction to "step aside and stand here" can be seen as a lesson in patience and waiting for the right timing, trusting in God's plan and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_messengers.htm">Role of Messengers</a></b><br>The role of Ahimaaz and the Cushite highlights the importance of being a faithful messenger, delivering truth with integrity and courage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/handling_disappointment.htm">Handling Disappointment</a></b><br>Ahimaaz's willingness to step aside can teach us about handling disappointment gracefully, trusting that God has a purpose even when our plans are not fulfilled.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>The events surrounding King David remind us of God's sovereignty in leadership and the unfolding of His divine plan, even amidst human rebellion and conflict.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_18_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 18:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_18_30_Wait_for_God_s_timing.htm">How does 2 Samuel 18:30 demonstrate the importance of waiting on God's timing?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_patience_from_Ahimaaz.htm">What can we learn about patience from Ahimaaz's actions in 2 Samuel 18:30?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_to_Proverbs_3_5-6_on_trust_3.htm">How does this verse connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God's plan?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_emulate_Ahimaaz_s_obedience.htm">In what ways can we apply Ahimaaz's example of obedience in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_18_30_Listening_for_God_today.htm">How does 2 Samuel 18:30 encourage us to listen for God's direction today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_say_stand_aside.htm">Why did David tell Ahimaaz to "stand aside" in 2 Samuel 18:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_18_30_David_s_leadership_style.htm">What does 2 Samuel 18:30 reveal about David's leadership style?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_18_30_and_divine_justice.htm">How does 2 Samuel 18:30 reflect the theme of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_horns_of_the_altar's_role.htm">What are the Horns of the Altar's significance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/david's_horsemen_capture__1,700_or_7,000.htm">When David defeated the King of Zobah, how many horsemen did he capture?

Sensing missing details, the king immediately created space&#8212;both physically and conversationally&#8212;for the fuller truth to arrive.<p>- God-honoring leadership often calls for clear boundaries, as when Moses told the Israelites, &#8220;Stand still and see the salvation of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>- Removing distractions helps preserve order, echoing the Lord&#8217;s directive to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Separate yourselves from this congregation&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/16-21.htm">Numbers 16:21</a>).<p>- David&#8217;s action reflects spiritual discernment: he refuses to settle for half-answers, a posture affirmed in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which warns against responding before hearing a matter in full.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Said the king</b><p>The narrative emphasizes that the command comes from &#8220;the king.&#8221; David&#8217;s authority is God-installed (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently treats rightful authority as an extension of God&#8217;s governance&#8212;&#8220;There is no authority except from God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>- David models a ruler who seeks truth before judgment, paralleling the righteous king celebrated in <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a>, where searching out a matter is called a royal honor.<p>- His measured tone contrasts with Saul&#8217;s impetuousness (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>), reminding believers that godly authority acts with both firmness and restraint.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And stand here</b><p>David does not dismiss Ahimaaz; he stations him nearby. The messenger remains available yet silent, an exercise in patient readiness.<p>- Waiting within earshot keeps Ahimaaz positioned for any further service, much like the servants in <a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a> who remained attentive until Jesus&#8217; next instruction.<p>- <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> urges, &#8220;Wait patiently for the LORD,&#8221; a principle mirrored in this simple command to &#8220;stand.&#8221;<p>- The moment underscores that presence&#8212;sometimes quiet, motionless presence&#8212;is ministry in itself (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>, where Job&#8217;s friends initially sat with him in silence).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he stepped aside</b><p>Ahimaaz obeys instantly, showing humility and respect.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6-7</a> advises, &#8220;Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,&#8221; wisdom Ahimaaz lives out by yielding the spotlight.<p>- His compliance fits the broader biblical theme of prompt obedience, seen in the disciples who &#8220;left their nets at once and followed Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>).<p>- Obedience without protest often positions servants for future usefulness; Ahimaaz will shortly hear the Cushite&#8217;s full report and learn the gravity of Absalom&#8217;s fate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In one brief verse, the Holy Spirit highlights decisive leadership, honored authority, patient waiting, and willing obedience. David safeguards truth by telling Ahimaaz, &#8220;Move aside &#8230; and stand here,&#8221; and the messenger&#8217;s immediate compliance shows the heart of a faithful servant. Together they illustrate how God brings clarity when His people create space for it, respect rightful authority, remain patiently available, and respond in humble obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Move aside,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5437.htm">Strong's 5437: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn about, go around, surround</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
