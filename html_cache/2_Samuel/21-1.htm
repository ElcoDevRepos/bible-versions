David's reign is characterized by military conquests, the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital, and the centralization of worship. His leadership is seen as a high point in Israel's history, setting the stage for the future temple built by his son Solomon.<p><b>there was a famine for three successive years</b><br>Famine in the ancient Near East often indicated divine displeasure or judgment. In the biblical context, famines were sometimes used by God to draw attention to sin or to prompt repentance. The three-year duration emphasizes the severity and persistence of the issue, suggesting a need for divine intervention.<p><b>and David sought the face of the LORD</b><br>Seeking the face of the LORD implies a desire for guidance and understanding from God. This phrase indicates David's reliance on God for leadership and decision-making. It reflects the biblical principle of seeking divine wisdom in times of crisis, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_chronicles/16-11.htm">1 Chronicles 16:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>.<p><b>And the LORD said, &#8220;It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family,</b><br>This revelation highlights the concept of corporate responsibility and the consequences of sin affecting future generations. Saul's actions against the Gibeonites violated a covenant made during Joshua's time (Joshua 9), demonstrating the importance of faithfulness to oaths and agreements. The shedding of innocent blood is a serious offense in biblical law, often requiring atonement.<p><b>because he killed the Gibeonites.&#8221;</b><br>The Gibeonites were a group of people who had made a treaty with Israel during Joshua's leadership. Saul's attempt to annihilate them was a breach of this covenant, illustrating the theme of justice and retribution. This incident underscores the biblical principle that God honors covenants and expects His people to do the same. The narrative also foreshadows the need for reconciliation and restitution, themes central to the gospel message and the work of Christ as the ultimate reconciler.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who seeks God's guidance during a national crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who reveals the cause of the famine to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The former King of Israel, whose actions against the Gibeonites have brought about the famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people who were wronged by Saul, leading to the famine as divine retribution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food lasting three years, prompting David to seek divine insight.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>David's response to the famine is to seek the Lord's face, demonstrating the importance of turning to God in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Saul's actions against the Gibeonites have long-lasting effects, illustrating how sin can have repercussions beyond the immediate moment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>The violation of the covenant with the Gibeonites highlights the importance of honoring commitments and the serious nature of breaking them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's response to the injustice against the Gibeonites shows His commitment to justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_repentance.htm">Intercession and Repentance</a></b><br>David's role in seeking resolution for the famine underscores the importance of intercession and seeking reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_21_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 21:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_21_1_Seek_God_in_crises.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:1 illustrate the importance of seeking God's guidance in crises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/King_David_s_role_in_Israel_s_famine.htm">What role does King David play in addressing the famine in Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Use_David_s_inquiry_for_personal_issues.htm">How can we apply David's example of inquiry to our personal challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Links_between_2_Sam_21_1_divine_inquiry.htm">What scriptural connections exist between 2 Samuel 21:1 and other instances of divine inquiry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_guide_resolution.htm">How does this verse encourage us to address unresolved issues in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_famine_in_David_s_reign_2_Sam_21_1.htm">Why did God send a famine during David's reign according to 2 Samuel 21:1?

There is no more definite clue to the time, and the expression "in the days of David" seems purposely indefinite. The narrative is omitted from the Book of Chronicles.<p><span class= "bld">Three years.</span>--A famine in Palestine was always a consequence of deficient winter rains, and was not very uncommon; but a famine enduring for three successive years was alarming enough to awaken attention and to suggest some especial cause.<p><span class= "bld">Enquired of the Lord.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">sought the face of the Lord. </span>The phrase is a different one from that often used in Judges and Samuel, and agrees with other indications that this narrative may have been obtained by the compiler from some other records than those from which he drew the bulk of this book. David turned to the true Source for a knowledge of the meaning of this unusual affliction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a famine in the days of David;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and there was.</span> There is an entire absence of any mark of time to show in what part of David's reign this famine took place. It does not even follow, from the mention of Mephibosheth's name, that it must have happened at a time subsequent to the sending for that prince from Machir's house; for it may have been the search after the descendants of Saul which made David remember the son of his old friend. The burial, however, of the bones of Saul and Jonathan as an act of respect to the slaughtered king makes it probable that the narrative belongs to the early part of David's reign, as also does the apparent fact that the seven victims were all young and unmarried. Mephibosheth, we read, had a young son when David sent for him. Now, he was five years old when his father was slain (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), and thus at the end of David's reign of seven years and a half at Hebron, he would be twelve and a half years of age. The famine lasted three years, and if David had been king four or five years when the famine began, Mephibosheth, at the age of twenty, might well have a "young son" in a country where men marry early. We cannot believe that the famine occurred long after David had been king of all Israel, because manifestly it would have been unjust and even monstrous to punish a nation for the sins of a king who had long passed away. The sins of its rulers are visited upon a nation constantly through a long series of years, but it is always in the way of natural development. A statesman may put a nation upon a wrong track, and may involve it in serious difficulties, and even in irretrievable disaster, unless some one be raised up able to make it retrace its steps and regain the rightful direction. But this famine was a direct interference of Providence, and to justify it the sin must be still fresh in the national remembrance. Had it been an old crime long ago forgotten, instead of leading men to repentance, this long and terrible punishment would have hardened men's hearts, and made them regard the Deity as vindictive. It is even probable that the sin was still being committed; for though commenced and approved by Saul, his oppression and purpose of gradually destroying the native races was too much in accord with men's usual way of acting not to be continued, unless stopped by the justice of the ruler. We all know how the Red Indian, the Bushman, the Maori, and the Australian disappear before the advance of the white man. It needs only apathy on the part of the government, and rougher methods for clearing them off are practised than men would care to own. So with Gibeonites and Perizzites and other native races, a similar process would be going on. The lands they held, their little villages, their pastures, and above all their strongholds, would be coveted by the dominant race, and entrenchments would lead to quarrels, in which the natives would find any resistance on their part punished as rebellion. Even David seized the hill fortress of Jebus for his capital, though he still left Araunah the nominal title of king (<a href="/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a>). Saul had lent all the weight of the royal authority to the extermination of the natives, and this chapter records the Divine condemnation of wrong done by the dominantrace to the aborigines. It remains to this day the charter for their protection, and not only forbids their extinction, but requires that they shall be treated with fair and even justice, and their rights respected and maintained. It has been objected that the execution of Saul's seven sons was a political crime committed to render David's throne secure. If at all to his advantage, it was so only to a very slight extent. The sons of Rizpah could never have become pretenders to the throne; nor were the sons of Merab likely to be much more dangerous. In a few years they would have married, and formed other ties, and been merged in the general population. Mephibosheth was the heir of Saul, and David protected him and Micha his son. It was quite in the spirit of the times to visit upon Saul's house the sins of its chief. The principle was the same as when all Israel stoned Achan, his sons and his daughters, his oxen and his asses, his sheep and his tent, for brining iniquity upon the people (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>). We keep chiefly in view the doctrine of personal responsibility; in the Old Testament the other doctrine of the collective responsibility of a family, a city, a nation, was made the more prominent It was the Prophet Ezekiel who in ch. 18. stated clearly and with Divine force that "the soul that sinneth it shall die;" but that the sinner's son, if he walk in God's statutes, shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live. But the collective responsibility enacted in the second commandment is still God's law. In the philosophic jargon of our times the two factors which form human character and decide our fortunes are "heredity and environment." Heredity was the prevailing sentiment in David's days; and it seemed right to the Gibeonites that the sons of the man who had slaughtered them should die for their father's sins; and it seemed just to David also. But he spared the heir to Saul's throne. There is no adequate reason for supposing that David was influenced by political motives, and the more important lesson of the narrative is the emphatic condemnation given in it of wrong and cruelty to aboriginal tribes. <span class="cmt_word">David inquired of the Lord;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">David sought the face of Jehovah.</span> The phrase is remarkable, and not found elsewhere in Samuel. Probably it means that he went to Gibeon to pray in the sanctuary, and consult God by Urim and Thummim. His bloody house. The Hebrew means "the house on which rested the guilt of murder." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now during the reign</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
