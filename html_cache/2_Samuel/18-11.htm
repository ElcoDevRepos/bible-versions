The context is the battle between David's forces and those loyal to Absalom. Joab, David's military commander, is addressing a soldier who had the opportunity to kill Absalom, David's rebellious son. This moment highlights the tension between loyalty to the king and the practicalities of warfare. The soldier's hesitation reflects the complexity of the situation, as Absalom is both an enemy and the king's son.<p><b>Why did you not strike him to the ground right there?</b><br>Joab questions the soldier's decision not to kill Absalom when he had the chance. This reflects the brutal realities of ancient warfare, where decisive action was often necessary. The phrase "strike him to the ground" suggests a lethal blow, emphasizing the expectation of swift justice in battle. Joab's question also underscores the importance of eliminating threats to the kingdom, even if they are family.<p><b>I would have given you ten shekels of silver</b><br>The offer of ten shekels of silver indicates a significant reward for killing Absalom. In ancient Israel, silver was a common medium of exchange, and this amount would have been a substantial incentive. This reflects the value placed on removing Absalom as a threat. The use of silver as a reward also connects to other biblical instances where silver is used as payment, such as Judas's betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, highlighting themes of betrayal and loyalty.<p><b>and a warrior&#8217;s belt!</b><br>The warrior's belt symbolizes honor and status among soldiers. In ancient times, a belt was not only functional but also a sign of a warrior's prowess and achievements. Joab's promise of a belt suggests recognition and elevation within the military ranks. This offer highlights the cultural importance of honor and reputation in the ancient Near Eastern context, where such symbols were highly prized. The belt can also be seen as a type of reward for faithfulness and bravery, drawing a parallel to the spiritual armor described in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where the belt of truth is part of the armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

The dishonour done to his father at Jerusalem was even intended by Ahithophel to render all reconciliation impossible. But Joab was disobeying the king's express orders, and as Absalom was incapable of making resistance, he ought to have taken him prisoner, and left it to David to decide what his punishment should be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You just</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
