His role highlights the importance of prophetic guidance in Israel's monarchy. The phrase "that day" refers to the immediate aftermath of David's sin of conducting a census, which led to a plague as divine judgment. Gad's arrival signifies God's intervention and the beginning of restoration.<p><b>and said to him,</b><br>This indicates direct communication from God through His prophet. In the Old Testament, God often communicated His will through prophets, who were His mouthpieces. This underscores the seriousness and divine authority of the message being delivered to David.<p><b>&#8220;Go up and build an altar to the LORD</b><br>Building an altar was a significant act of worship and atonement in ancient Israel. Altars were places of sacrifice, symbolizing repentance and reconciliation with God. This command to "go up" suggests a physical ascent, possibly indicating the elevated location of the threshing floor, which was often on a hill to catch the wind for winnowing grain.<p><b>on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&#8221;</b><br>Araunah was a Jebusite, one of the original inhabitants of Jerusalem before David conquered the city. The threshing floor's location is significant as it later becomes the site of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), making it a place of enduring spiritual importance. The use of a Jebusite's property for an altar also reflects the inclusivity of God's plan, foreshadowing the opening of God's covenant to all nations. The threshing floor, a place of separation and purification, symbolizes the purging of sin and the preparation for divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a></b><br>A prophet during King David's reign, serving as a messenger of God's will.

In an agony of grief, he poured out his prayer that Jerusalem might be spared, and God heard him, and sent Gad a second time to bid him offer sacrifice, that, by making an atonement, he might stand between the dead and the living, as Aaron had done in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>) He is therefore to leave the tabernacle, and mount up to the summit on which Araunah's threshing floor was situated. We read in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> that David wished to go to Gibeon, where the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt offering were, to inquire of God, but that he was afraid, as the angel of the pestilence was smiting outside the walls. This is mentioned as an excuse for his offering at an unconsecrated spot. But it also suggests that David's choice was a submission to a chastisement already at work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
