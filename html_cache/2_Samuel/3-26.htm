This indicates a moment of transition and potential tension, as Joab was known for his strong personality and decisive actions. Joab's loyalty to David was often mixed with personal vendettas, as seen in his previous actions and future decisions. This phrase sets the stage for Joab's independent actions, which often conflicted with David's intentions.<p><b>he sent messengers after Abner</b><br>Joab's decision to send messengers after Abner highlights his personal vendetta against Abner, who had killed Joab's brother Asahel in battle (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). This act of sending messengers shows Joab's initiative and possibly his disregard for David's authority or wishes. It reflects the ongoing power struggles and personal conflicts within the kingdom, which were common in the turbulent period of the united monarchy.<p><b>who brought him back from the well of Sirah</b><br>The well of Sirah is a specific location, likely near Hebron, where Abner was intercepted. This geographical detail underscores the historical and narrative accuracy of the account. Wells were significant in ancient times as places of gathering and sustenance, often serving as landmarks. The act of bringing Abner back suggests a level of coercion or deception, as Abner was likely unaware of Joab's intentions.<p><b>But David was unaware of it</b><br>This phrase indicates a lack of communication or possible deception within David's administration. David's unawareness of Joab's actions suggests a disconnect between the king and his military commander, highlighting the complexities of leadership and governance. It also sets the stage for the unfolding drama, as David's ignorance of Joab's actions would later have significant political and personal repercussions. This lack of awareness can be seen as a foreshadowing of the challenges David would face in maintaining unity and justice within his kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David, but also for his personal vendettas and acts of violence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, anointed by God, who sought to unify the kingdom and rule with justice and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who initially opposed David but later sought to align with him to unite Israel under David's rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/well_of_sirah.htm">Well of Sirah</a></b><br>A location near Hebron where Abner was intercepted by Joab's messengers.

There was probably a caravanserai there, at which Abner halted, intending to continue his march homewards as soon as the coolness of evening set in. Here Joab's messengers overtook him, and, speaking in David's name - for otherwise Abner would not have fallen into the trap - asked him to return for further conference, mentioning, perhaps, Joab's arrival as the reason. In this way Abner's suspicions would be set at rest, and it would seem quite natural for him to find Joab waiting for him at the gate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
