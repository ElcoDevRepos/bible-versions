This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where kings had servants or young men ready to carry out their commands. The term "young men" often refers to those who served in various capacities, including military and administrative roles. This action takes place shortly after the death of Saul, Israel's first king, and highlights the transition of power to David.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Go, execute him!&#8221;</b><br>David's command to execute the Amalekite who claimed to have killed Saul is rooted in the principle of justice. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, executing someone who claimed to have killed the Lord's anointed was seen as upholding divine justice. This reflects the biblical theme of respecting God's chosen leaders, as seen in David's previous refusal to harm Saul himself (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). The execution also serves as a deterrent against those who might seek to harm God's anointed for personal gain.<p><b>So the young man struck him down, and he died.</b><br>The young man's obedience to David's command demonstrates the loyalty and duty expected of servants in the ancient Near Eastern context. The swift execution underscores the seriousness with which David viewed the claim of the Amalekite. This act of justice aligns with the biblical principle that those who shed blood unlawfully must themselves face death (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate justice that will be executed by Jesus Christ, the greater David, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

The Amalekite had just recognised him as king, and therefore acknowledged his authority. But, besides this, David and his band of 600 outlaws were accustomed to live by the sword, and to defend themselves against Philistines, Amalekites, and other foes as best they could; and here stood before them one, by his own confession, guilty of high treason.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go near, and fall upon him.</span> This was no hasty sentence, for they had "fasted until even." And before pronouncing it David asks, "Whence art thou?" that is, he makes more full inquiry into his condition and previous doings. He knew that he was an Amalekite, and most probably had seen clearly enough that his whole story was false; but before deciding upon his fate, he desired fuller information as to the man's previous life. His question elicits from him that he was a subject of Saul. For the word "stranger" means a settler, who had withdrawn from his own country and joined himself to Israel. Moreover, it was the Amalekite's father who had done this, and probably he was one of many, who, finding their old nomad life too dangerous, had sought a home in the southern districts of Judah; but when the war broke out, the old instinct of these Bedaween made them follow the army for pilfer and trade in spoil. But as the son of a settler, the Amalekite owed by birth allegiance to Saul, and, should the occasion arise, was bound to render him loyal aid. Now, according to his own account, he had found Saul in no immediate danger of death, "for his life was still whole within him." Escape was at least possible with the Amalekite's aid, but he is eager to hill him. And David's question, "How wast thou not afraid...to destroy the Lord's anointed?" virtually means, "How wast thou not afraid to kill thy own king?" The Lord, that is, Jehovah, was no name of power to any outside the covenant people, nor in settling in Judea did the Amalekites accept the national religion. But the words would show even to a stranger that Saul was Israel's lawful and consecrated king. Commentators, with strange perverseness, have found in these words an outbreak of selfishness on David's part, and have supposed that he wished to guard his own person against future treason by making a wholesome example. But this is both to misunderstand the examination of the culprit summed up in vers. 13, 14, and also to put aside all account of the deep and agonizing sorrow which was rending David's heart. What would have been an Englishman's feelings if news had come that we had lost, for instance, the battle of Waterloo, and if the fugitive who brought the information had said that he had killed the wounded commander-in-chief? In David's case, besides deep distress at the disaster which had befallen his country, there was personal grief for the death of Jonathan and of Saul's other sons, who were David's brothers-in-law; and the words really prove his loyalty to Saul himself. He was still Jehovah's anointed, whatever his conduct might have been; and we have found David on previous occasions actuated by the same generous respect for duty when clearly it was contrary to his own interests (see, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>). David put the wretch justly to death for meanly murdering one whom he might possibly have saved. And the man's very purpose was to suggest to David, in a covert way, that escape really was possible, but that he had made all things sure, and so deserved a large reward. As a matter of fact, he had not killed Saul, but had invented the story because, judging David by his own immoral standard, he had supposed that he would regard the crime as a valuable service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">summoned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
