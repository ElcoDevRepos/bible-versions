This phrase underscores the importance of following divine guidance, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in Joshua's conquests (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-9</a>) and Jesus' submission to the Father's will (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>). David's actions here reflect his reliance on God's direction rather than his own understanding, a model for faithful leadership.<p><b>and he struck down the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. David's victory over them is significant, as it demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in delivering Israel from its foes. This victory can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate triumph over sin and death, as Jesus is the ultimate deliverer of His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). The defeat of the Philistines also fulfills earlier prophecies and promises of Israel's dominance over their enemies (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>).<p><b>all the way from Gibeon to Gezer</b><br>Gibeon and Gezer were significant locations in ancient Israel. Gibeon, located northwest of Jerusalem, was known for its strategic importance and its earlier treaty with Israel during Joshua's time (Joshua 9). Gezer, situated further west, was a key city on the route to the coastal plain. The mention of these locations indicates the extent of David's military campaign and the thoroughness of his victory. Archaeological findings at these sites have provided insights into the period's historical context, confirming the biblical narrative's accuracy.

One or the other is a slip of the scribe, and there can be little question that Gibeon is the true reading, since it lies about five and a half miles northwest of Jerusalem, while Geba (Gibeah) is about seven and a half miles north-east. The site of Gazer (or Gezer) has not been exactly identified, but it was certainly just on the edge of the Philistine plain. The distance of the pursuit from Gibeon was about twelve miles, and six miles more must already have been passed over before reaching Gibeon from the valley of Rephaim. The flight of the Philistines was determined in this north-westerly direction at first, from the fact that David had "fetched a compass," and attacked them from the south. In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.">1Chronicles 14:8-17</a>, these battles are placed between the unsuccessful (<a href="/context/2_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.">2Samuel 13:5-14</a>) and the successful (2 Samuel 15) attempts to bring up the ark to Jerusalem. It is impossible now to determine the exact details of the chronology.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Geba until thou some to Gazer.</span> In <a href="/1_chronicles/14-16.htm">1 Chronicles 14:16</a> "Gibson" is substituted for "Geba," and it is one of those corrections which a commentator is inclined to adopt, because it makes all things easy. For Gibeon lay directly on the road from the Rephaim valley towards Gazer, and the armies must have passed it in the fight. But if "Geba" be the right reading here, then the battle must have been most sternly contested. For it is the "Gibeah of Benjamin," Hebrew, "Geba of Benjamin," described in <a href="/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>. The Philistines had a garrison there in Saul's time (<a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>), and had probably again occupied it as a military post after their victory at Gilboa. To reach it the line of retreat would go nine miles northward over difficult ground; but this was not disadvantageous to a retreating army as long as it remained unbroken, and the Philistines would expect to be able to make a successful defense at a strong citadel like Geba, held by a garrison of their own troops. But when driven by David's "mighty men" from this fortified hill, being hemmed in by the defile of Michmash on the east, they would have no choice but to hurry down the valleys to the west, and, still passing by Gibson, so flee to Gazer. Thus the reading "Geba" implies a stout and long resistance ending in a most complete victory. And confessedly this was a decisive battle, fought with larger forces, and causing far larger loss to the Philistines than that at Baal-Perazim, where, attacked by only a few men, they were seized with panic, and saved themselves by a headlong flight. <span class="accented">Gazer</span> lay upon the border of Ephraim, and was one of the royal cities of the Canaanites, and so strong that it was left in the hands of its old possessors (<a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 10</a>; <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>). Subsequently Solomon fortified it (<a href="/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17</a>), as being the key of the defiles which led from Ekron and the plain of Philistia up to Jerusalem. We also find it mentioned as an important military post in the days of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52). The pursuit would naturally stop here, as the fugitives would now be in their own country, and succour would be close at hand. Probably, too, the Canaanites who held the fortress were friendly to them, and gave them shelter. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
