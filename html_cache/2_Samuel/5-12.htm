This awareness is not just intellectual but a deep recognition of God's hand in his life. It reflects a pattern seen throughout Scripture where God reveals His purposes to His chosen leaders, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Paul on the road to Damascus (Acts 9).<p><b>that the LORD had established him as king over Israel</b><br>The establishment of David as king is a fulfillment of God's promise to him, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a> when Samuel anointed David. This phrase underscores the divine authority and legitimacy of David's kingship, contrasting with Saul's reign, which was marked by disobedience and eventual rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). The term "established" indicates a firm and secure position, suggesting God's sovereign will in the leadership of Israel.<p><b>and had exalted his kingdom</b><br>The exaltation of David's kingdom points to the prosperity and expansion of Israel under his rule. This is not merely a political or military achievement but a divine act. It foreshadows the ultimate exaltation of the Kingdom of God through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>for the sake of His people Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights God's covenantal faithfulness to Israel. David's kingship is not for his own glory but for the benefit and welfare of God's chosen people. It reflects the biblical theme of leadership as service, seen in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>. The welfare of Israel is central to God's redemptive plan, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) and the eventual coming of the Messiah through the line of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the newly anointed king over Israel.

The people of Israel are the beneficiaries of God's actions through David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, Jerusalem is the city David had recently captured and made his capital, symbolizing the unification of Israel under his rule.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom.htm">The Kingdom</a></b><br>Refers to the united monarchy of Israel under David's leadership, which God has exalted for the sake of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>Recognize that leadership and authority are established by God.

Our successes should be viewed as opportunities to serve others and fulfill God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on God's faithfulness to His promises. David's kingship is a testament to God's unwavering commitment to His covenant with Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Emulate David's humility in recognizing God's role in his success. True leadership acknowledges dependence on God and seeks His guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_focus.htm">Community Focus</a></b><br>Prioritize the well-being of the community over personal gain.

The tragical fate, too, of Saul, who, after so many heroic struggles, had seen the earlier glories of his reign fade away, and had sought deliverance from his misery by suicide; all this must have often depressed his spirits. But gradually his fears passed away; and when he had twice defeated the Philistines, and been able to establish his rule, and with it some degree of orderly government throughout the twelve tribes, David saw in all this, and in the embassies from foreign nations, the proof, not of his own ability, but of Jehovah's purpose to <span class="cmt_word">exalt his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> In this David was still a man after God's own heart, in that he felt himself to be only an instrument for the doing, not his own will, but the purpose of his Divine Master. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">realized</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
