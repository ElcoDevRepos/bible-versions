Armoni and Mephibosheth were the sons of Rizpah, Saul's concubine. The name "Mephibosheth" is shared with another of Saul's descendants, the son of Jonathan, who was shown kindness by David (2 Samuel 9). This highlights the complexity of David's relationships with Saul's family, balancing justice and mercy.<p><b>the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul,</b><br>Rizpah, a concubine of Saul, is noted for her later actions in protecting the bodies of her sons after their execution (<a href="/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>). Her story is a poignant example of maternal devotion and the personal cost of political decisions. Rizpah's lineage, being the daughter of Aiah, suggests her noble status, which was common for concubines of kings, as they often came from influential families.<p><b>as well as the five sons whom Merab daughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</b><br>Merab was Saul's eldest daughter, originally promised to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-19</a>) but given to Adriel instead. This marriage alliance with Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite, indicates the political nature of marriages in royal families, aimed at strengthening alliances. The mention of Barzillai the Meholathite should not be confused with Barzillai the Gileadite, who supported David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>). The execution of these sons was part of a covenantal restitution to the Gibeonites, reflecting the serious nature of oaths and covenants in ancient Israelite culture, as well as the principle of

David, as king, &#8220;took&#8221; the men requested by the Gibeonites (<a href="/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Saul had violated Israel&#8217;s covenant with the Gibeonites (<a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a>), bringing a famine on the land (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records that &#8220;bloodshed pollutes the land&#8221; and must be answered (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). David seeks to end the famine by honoring God&#8217;s justice.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s choice also respects the oath he swore to Jonathan by sparing Jonathan&#8217;s son Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Armoni and Mephibosheth</b><p>These are two of Saul&#8217;s surviving sons.<p>&#8226; Their names remind readers of Saul&#8217;s dynasty, now under judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/13-8.htm">2 Samuel 13:8</a> contrasts Absalom&#8217;s later actions).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s handing over of Saul&#8217;s descendants fulfills the Gibeonites&#8217; specific demand for seven male heirs (<a href="/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>), underscoring covenant faithfulness even when painful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul</b><p>Rizpah was Saul&#8217;s concubine (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Her story will soon highlight motherly devotion as she guards the bodies from birds and beasts (<a href="/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The family line of Saul suffers because of Saul&#8217;s own transgression, illustrating principles seen earlier in Scripture: &#8220;visiting the iniquity of fathers upon children&#8221; when the children remain in their fathers&#8217; sins (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), yet each remains morally responsible (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as the five sons</b><p>David adds five grandsons of Saul, making a total of seven&#8212;often a biblical number of completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The full number satisfies the call for justice, bringing the famine to an end once the sentence is carried out (<a href="/2_samuel/21-14.htm">2 Samuel 21:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The choice shows that God&#8217;s requirements are exact and thorough; partial obedience would not have lifted the national curse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom Merab daughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite</b><p>Merab, Saul&#8217;s oldest daughter, had once been promised to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Her five sons by Adriel are now included in the atoning act, linking Saul&#8217;s broken promises to consequences for his wider family.<p>&#8226; Barzillai the Meholathite is distinct from Barzillai the Gileadite who helped David (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>); the repetition of the name shows the extended reach of Saul&#8217;s legacy.<p>&#8226; By recording these specific genealogies, Scripture underlines the historical reality of the events and the faithfulness of God to His word down to individual families (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a> records David&#8217;s obedient, sorrowful selection of seven male descendants of Saul&#8212;two by Rizpah and five by Merab&#8212;to satisfy the Gibeonites&#8217; demand and lift God&#8217;s judgment on Israel.

He spared, for Jonathan's sake, the only descendants of Saul in the male line, who only could have advanced any claim to the throne, and took (1) the two sons of Rizpah, a concubine of Saul, with whom Abner had committed adultery (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm" title="And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?">2Samuel 3:7</a>), and (2) five sons of Saul's eldest daughter Merab, who had been promised in marriage to David himself, and then given to another (<a href="/context/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1Samuel 18:17-19</a>). The text has <span class= "ital">Michal </span>instead of <span class= "ital">Merab; </span>but this must be an error of the scribe, since it was Merab, not Michal, who was married to "Adriel the Meholathite" (<a href="/1_samuel/18-19.htm" title="But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.">1Samuel 18:19</a>), and Michal was childless (<a href="/2_samuel/6-23.htm" title="Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.">2Samuel 6:23</a>). The English phrase "brought up for" is taken from the Chaldee; the Hebrew, as noted in the margin, is <span class= "ital">bare to.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michal</span>. It was Merab who became the wife of Adriel the Meholathite (<a href="/1_samuel/18-19.htm">1 Samuel 18:19</a>). Michal was childless (see <a href="/2_samuel/6-23.htm">2 Samuel 6:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whom she brought up for.</span> This is one of the many cases of untrustworthiness in the renderings of the Authorized Version. We have noticed a very flagrant instance before in <a href="/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>. The object of these mistranslations is always the same, namely, to remove some verbal discrepancy in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew says here "five sons of Michal, whom she bare to Adriel;" but Michal never bore a child, therefore something must be substituted which will save the Hebrew from this verbal inaccuracy, and Michal must be represented as having taken Merab's place (perhaps at her death), and been foster mother to her children. This explanation is, it is true, taken from the Jewish Targum; but the Targum never professes to be an exact translation, and constantly perverts the meaning of the plainest passages for preconceived reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1441;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
