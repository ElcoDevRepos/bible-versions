Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, was acknowledging King David's authority and expressing humility. This act reflects the cultural norms of the time, where physical gestures were significant in demonstrating one's position and intentions.<p><b>and said, &#8220;What is your servant,</b><br>By referring to himself as "your servant," Mephibosheth is adopting a posture of humility and servitude. This phrase indicates his recognition of David's kingship and his own lower status. It also reflects the biblical theme of servanthood, which is prevalent throughout Scripture, where individuals often identify themselves as servants of God or others in authority.<p><b>that you should show regard</b><br>The concept of showing regard or kindness is central to the narrative. David's actions towards Mephibosheth are motivated by his covenant with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>). This act of kindness is a demonstration of covenant faithfulness, a recurring theme in the Bible, where God and His people are called to be faithful to their promises.<p><b>for a dead dog like me?&#8221;</b><br>The term "dead dog" is a Hebrew idiom expressing extreme self-deprecation and insignificance. In the cultural and historical context, dogs were considered unclean animals, and calling oneself a "dead dog" was a way to emphasize one's lowliness and unworthiness. This phrase highlights Mephibosheth's awareness of his vulnerable position as a descendant of Saul, the former king, and his astonishment at David's grace. It also echoes the biblical theme of God's grace towards the humble and lowly, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a> and <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

Mephibosheth described himself in terms similar to those used by David of himself to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>); but he meant no more than to express great gratitude, and also to acknowledge the disparity of rank between him and the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Mephibosheth bowed down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1429;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ta&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
