In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/16-3.htm">2 Samuel 16:3</a>, Ziba falsely claimed that Mephibosheth was hoping to regain the kingdom of his grandfather Saul. Slander, or false accusation, is a recurring theme in the Bible, often used by adversaries to undermine the righteous (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/6-5.htm">Nehemiah 6:5-7</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on loyalty and truthfulness, making slander a serious offense. This incident highlights the challenges of discerning truth in leadership and the potential for manipulation by those seeking personal gain.<p><b>Yet my lord the king is like the angel of God,</b><br>This phrase is a simile comparing King David to an "angel of God," suggesting wisdom, discernment, and divine guidance. In biblical literature, angels are often seen as messengers or representatives of God, possessing insight and authority (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1-22</a>). The comparison implies that David, as king, is expected to act with fairness and justice, reflecting God's character. This expectation is consistent with the role of a king in Israel, who was to lead the people according to God's laws and principles. The phrase also echoes earlier instances where David is described in similar terms, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/29-9.htm">1 Samuel 29:9</a>, reinforcing his reputation as a just and discerning leader.<p><b>so do what is good in your eyes.</b><br>This phrase reflects a deferential attitude towards the king's judgment, acknowledging his authority to make decisions. In the historical context of ancient monarchies, subjects often expressed submission to the king's will, trusting in his ability to rule justly. The phrase "in your eyes" suggests a personal and subjective evaluation, indicating that the speaker, Mephibosheth, is entrusting his fate to David's discretion. This trust in the king's judgment is reminiscent of other biblical figures who submitted to God's will, such as Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), highlighting themes of submission and faith in divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul, Mephibosheth was crippled in both feet.
