Absalom, the son of King David, is speaking to those who come to seek justice. His words are part of a larger scheme to undermine his father's authority and position himself as a more accessible and just leader. This reflects the cunning and ambition that characterize Absalom's rebellion against David.<p><b>&#8220;If only someone would appoint me judge in the land,</b><br>Absalom expresses a desire to be appointed as a judge, which implies a position of authority and influence. In ancient Israel, judges were leaders who resolved disputes and maintained order. By suggesting that he should be appointed, Absalom is subtly criticizing the current administration and presenting himself as a better alternative. This reflects the political maneuvering common in monarchies, where power struggles often involved family members.<p><b>then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me,</b><br>Absalom promises accessibility and fairness, appealing to those who feel neglected or wronged by the current system. This statement highlights the importance of justice in Israelite society, where disputes were often settled at the city gates by elders or appointed judges. Absalom's promise to be available to all suggests a populist approach, aiming to win the hearts of the people by addressing their needs directly.<p><b>and I would give him justice.&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's claim to provide justice implies that the current system under King David is inadequate. This assertion is a direct challenge to David's rule, suggesting that Absalom could do better. The promise of justice is a powerful tool in gaining public support, as it resonates with the people's desire for fairness and righteousness. This mirrors the biblical theme of justice as a divine attribute, seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God requires His people to act justly. Absalom's words also foreshadow his eventual rebellion, as he seeks to usurp his father's throne by presenting himself as a champion of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.
