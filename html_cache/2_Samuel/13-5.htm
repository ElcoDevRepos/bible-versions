His role in this narrative highlights the influence of cunning advisors in royal courts, a common theme in ancient Near Eastern politics. His advice sets in motion a series of tragic events, reflecting the moral complexities and familial dysfunction within David's household.<p><b>&#8220;Lie down on your bed and pretend you are ill.</b><br>Feigning illness was a deceptive tactic used to manipulate circumstances, as seen in other biblical narratives. This act of deceit foreshadows the moral decay and lack of integrity that will lead to further calamity in David's family. It also reflects the broader theme of sin and its consequences, a recurring motif in the biblical narrative.<p><b>When your father comes to see you,</b><br>King David, as a father, is portrayed as caring and attentive, yet his inability to discern the true intentions of his son highlights his weaknesses as a ruler and a parent. This moment underscores the tension between familial love and the responsibilities of kingship, a struggle evident throughout David's life.<p><b>say to him, &#8216;Please let my sister Tamar come</b><br>Tamar, the daughter of David and Maacah, is central to this story. Her name means "palm tree," symbolizing beauty and grace. The request for her presence underlines the cultural norms of hospitality and family duty, which are manipulated for sinister purposes. This also foreshadows the violation of familial trust and the ensuing tragedy.<p><b>and give me something to eat.</b><br>The request for food is a guise for Amnon's ulterior motives. In biblical times, sharing a meal was an act of fellowship and trust, making the betrayal even more egregious. This act of deception contrasts with the biblical ideal of hospitality and care within the family.<p><b>Let her prepare it in my sight</b><br>The insistence on Tamar preparing the food in his sight is a calculated move to isolate her, reflecting the premeditated nature of Amnon's intentions. This phrase highlights the misuse of power and authority, a theme that resonates throughout the narrative of David's reign.<p><b>so I may watch her and eat it from her hand.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This request is laden with sinister intent, as it sets the stage for the violation of Tamar. The act of eating from her hand, meant to be intimate and familial, is twisted into a prelude to assault. This perversion of familial roles and relationships serves as a stark warning against the abuse of power and the consequences of unchecked desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab.htm">Jonadab</a></b><br>A cunning and shrewd man, Jonadab is the cousin of Amnon and a nephew of King David.

The verse warns us to reject deceitful advice, guard our hearts, and measure every plan against God&#8217;s unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Make thyself sick.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Feign thyself sick. </span>It has already been mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/13-2.htm" title="And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.">2Samuel 13:2</a> that Amnon "fell sick." That was the real pining of ungoverned and ungratified passion; this was a crafty feigning of sickness. Yet the miserable condition to which Amnon was brought by the former would give colour and plausibility to the latter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thy father cometh to see thee.</span> While the daughters lived in Oriental seclusion in the dwellings of their mothers, the sons seem to have had separate apartments assigned them in the palace. And David evidently was an affectionate father, who even went to the abodes of his sons in a loving and unceremonious way, to see how they fared. But Jonadab abused the king's affection, and made it the very means of removing the obstacles in the way of his daughter's disgrace. And like the whole tribe of flatterers and time servers, he employed his cleverness to gratify his patron's momentary passion, indifferent to the miserable consequences which must inevitably follow. For the least punishment which Amnon would have to bear would be exclusion from the succession to the crown, besides disgrace and his father's anger. Absalom, who was three or four years younger than Ashen, he despised, and counted for nothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jonadab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3082.htm">Strong's 3082: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonadab -- 'the LORD is noble', a Rechabite, also a nephew of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
