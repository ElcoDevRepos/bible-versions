Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, was a rival king over Israel, while David reigned over Judah. Hebron, where David was based, is significant as it was his first capital before Jerusalem. The act of bringing Ish-bosheth's head signifies a claim of loyalty to David, though it was misguided. This reflects the turbulent transition of power and the often ruthless methods employed. The act also foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule.<p><b>and said to the king, &#8220;Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life.</b><br>This statement underscores the animosity between the house of Saul and David. Saul had indeed sought David's life, driven by jealousy and fear of losing his kingdom. Ish-bosheth, as Saul's son, represented the continuation of Saul's line and opposition to David's kingship. The presentation of the head was meant to demonstrate the end of this opposition. This act, however, was not in line with David's character, who had previously shown respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p><b>Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects a common belief in divine retribution and justice. The killers of Ish-bosheth claimed that their actions were a fulfillment of God's will, providing David with vengeance. However, David's response, as seen in the following verses, shows his disapproval of their actions. This highlights a recurring biblical theme: human actions often misinterpret or misuse divine intentions. David's refusal to accept this act as divine justice aligns with his previous respect for Saul and his family, emphasizing his integrity and trust in God's timing and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ish-bosheth.htm">Ish-bosheth</a></b><br>The son of Saul, who was made king over Israel after Saul's death.

Now Ish-bosheth is gone, seemingly removing the last rival to the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Like those who flung Jezebel&#8217;s body from the window (<a href="/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32-37</a>), these men assume that eliminating a foe of God&#8217;s chosen ruler ensures favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your enemy who sought your life.</b><p>&#8226; The assassins rehearse the well-known story of Saul&#8217;s relentless pursuit of David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-29.htm">1 Samuel 18:29</a>; 23:14-15; 24:11).<p>&#8226; They overlook David&#8217;s repeated mercy toward Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:11, 23), forgetting that David viewed Saul&#8212;and by extension his house&#8212;as &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By labeling Ish-bosheth an enemy, they attempt to justify their betrayal, but Scripture shows that enmity never excused sin (<a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17-18</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king</b><p>&#8226; The killers invoke God&#8217;s name to sanctify their violence, echoing the misguided zeal of Jehu&#8217;s companions (<a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet true vengeance belongs to God alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). David himself had testified, &#8220;May the LORD judge between you and me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their claim assumes divine endorsement, but the coming verses reveal that God&#8217;s king will not accept evil means to a righteous end (<a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Saul and his offspring.</b><p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s dynasty was indeed fading, in fulfillment of Samuel&#8217;s word that the kingdom would be torn away (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p>&#8226; However, God&#8217;s judgments are His prerogative; human hands acting independently of Him bring guilt upon themselves, as with Uzzah touching the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s later care for Jonathan&#8217;s son Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-7</a>) proves he never sought to extinguish Saul&#8217;s line, underscoring the assassins&#8217; misreading of God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/4-8.htm">2 Samuel 4:8</a> records a grisly act meant to curry favor with David, but it instead spotlights the difference between human scheming and God-honoring integrity. Baanah and Rechab parade Ish-bosheth&#8217;s head as evidence that the LORD has avenged David, yet David&#8217;s forthcoming judgment against them (4:11-12) shows that God&#8217;s anointed king will not accept a throne built on murder. The verse, therefore, exposes the folly of justifying sin in the name of divine vengeance and reaffirms that God accomplishes His promises without compromising righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">The Lord hath avenged.</span>--It is not to be supposed that the murderers pretended a Divine commission for their wicked deed; they only meant to say that, in the providence of God, David was thus avenged on the seed of his cruel persecutor.
