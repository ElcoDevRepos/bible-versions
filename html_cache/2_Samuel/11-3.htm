This action marks the beginning of a series of events leading to sin. The inquiry reflects David's initial temptation, highlighting the human tendency to pursue desires without considering consequences. This moment parallels <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where desire leads to sin and sin to death. David's sending of messengers also contrasts with the ideal kingly behavior described in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16-17</a>, where kings are advised against multiplying wives and wealth, emphasizing self-control and reliance on God.<p><b>and he was told, &#8220;This is Bathsheba,</b><br>Bathsheba's introduction is significant as it sets the stage for the unfolding narrative. Her name means "daughter of the oath," which may imply a sense of covenant or promise, contrasting with the breach of covenant that follows. Bathsheba's role in the narrative is pivotal, as she later becomes the mother of Solomon, a key figure in Israel's history and a type of Christ in his wisdom and reign of peace. Her story also foreshadows the redemptive themes found in the genealogy of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a>, where she is mentioned as "the wife of Uriah."<p><b>the daughter of Eliam</b><br>Eliam, Bathsheba's father, is identified as one of David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-34.htm">2 Samuel 23:34</a>), indicating Bathsheba's connection to David's inner circle. This connection underscores the personal betrayal involved in David's actions. Eliam's father, Ahithophel, was a counselor to David, whose later betrayal (<a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>) may have been influenced by David's sin with Bathsheba. This familial link highlights the far-reaching consequences of sin, affecting not only individuals but entire families and communities.<p><b>and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.&#8221;</b><br>Uriah's designation as a Hittite suggests he was a foreigner who had integrated into Israelite society, possibly converting to worship Yahweh. His inclusion among David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>) indicates his loyalty and valor. The mention of Uriah's marriage to Bathsheba emphasizes the gravity of David's sin, as it involves adultery and betrayal of a loyal servant. Uriah's honorable character contrasts sharply with David's actions, highlighting themes of integrity and righteousness. Uriah's story also prefigures Christ's sacrificial loyalty and faithfulness, as he unwittingly becomes a victim of David's sin, paralleling Christ's innocent suffering for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who at this point in his life, is about to make a grave mistake by pursuing Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman whom David inquires about.
