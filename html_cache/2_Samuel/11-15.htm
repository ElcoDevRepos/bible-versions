The use of a letter indicates the formal and deliberate nature of David's plan. In ancient times, letters were a common means of communication for kings and military leaders, often sealed to ensure confidentiality. This letter is a pivotal moment in the narrative, showcasing David's attempt to cover up his sin with Bathsheba by orchestrating Uriah's death.<p><b>Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle;</b><br>David's command to place Uriah at the front lines highlights the king's misuse of power. The front lines were the most dangerous position in battle, often resulting in high casualties. Uriah, a Hittite, was one of David's mighty men, a group of elite warriors (<a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>). This act of betrayal against a loyal soldier underscores the gravity of David's sin. The phrase also reflects the harsh realities of ancient warfare, where strategic positioning often determined the outcome of battles.<p><b>then withdraw from him,</b><br>This part of the command reveals David's intention to isolate Uriah, ensuring his death. The tactic of withdrawing troops to leave a soldier exposed was a calculated move, demonstrating David's desperation to conceal his adultery. This act of treachery contrasts sharply with the biblical ideal of loyalty and protection among comrades, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, which speaks of a friend who loves at all times.<p><b>so that he may be struck down and killed.&#8221;</b><br>David's ultimate goal was Uriah's death, making this a premeditated act of murder. This phrase highlights the moral decline of David, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), who succumbed to sin. Theologically, this event foreshadows the need for a savior, as even the greatest of Israel's kings was flawed. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin, as David's actions led to personal and national turmoil, fulfilling Nathan's prophecy of calamity within David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who orchestrates the plan to have Uriah killed to cover up his own sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, whom David seeks to eliminate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who receives and executes David's orders regarding Uriah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, with whom David commits adultery, leading to the events of this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The unspecified location where Uriah is placed in the most dangerous position to ensure his death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often leads to further sin.

By putting his command in writing, he seals his intention in a permanent and traceable form&#8212;yet Joab alone will read it (v. 14).<p>- Compare Saul&#8217;s written orders against David (<a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>) and Jezebel&#8217;s letters sealing Naboth&#8217;s fate (<a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8&#8211;10</a>). Human kings can write decrees for evil, but God&#8217;s Word remains pure (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).<p>- The irony is painful: Uriah himself carries the very document that arranges his death&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16&#8211;19</a>, which lists &#8220;hands that shed innocent blood&#8221; and &#8220;a heart that devises wicked schemes.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put Uriah at the front</b><p>- David directs Joab: &#8220;Put Uriah at the front&#8221;. Battlefront placement ensured maximum exposure.<p>- Similar tactics were once used against David by Saul: &#8220;Let the hand of the Philistines be against him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>). Saul failed, but David now imitates that murderous mindset.<p>- The king who should protect his valiant men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13&#8211;17</a>) treats Uriah as expendable, forgetting that valor is a gift from God (<a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of the fiercest battle</b><p>- David does not just demand frontline duty; he specifies &#8220;the fiercest battle.&#8221; The plan counts on the chaos of intense combat to mask personal guilt.<p>- Scripture warns about hiding sin: &#8220;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>- Contrast with God&#8217;s righteous warriors like Eleazar who stood firm &#8220;when the men of Israel retreated&#8221; and &#8220;the LORD brought about a great victory&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9&#8211;10</a>). David now perverts that courage for murder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then withdraw from him</b><p>- Betrayal deepens: &#8220;then withdraw from him.&#8221; David orders deliberate abandonment&#8212;a soldier left without support.<p>- Joab complies (<a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>). The sin spreads: David&#8217;s private lust drags others into public guilt (cf. <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> mourns, &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230; has lifted up his heel against me,&#8221; a verse later echoed in Judas&#8217;s betrayal (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>). David foreshadows that treachery here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that he may be struck down and killed</b><p>- The goal is explicit: Uriah&#8217;s death. No accidental casualty, but premeditated murder, violating <a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>.<p>- Nathan will later confront David: &#8220;You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>). God names the crime David tries to disguise.<p>- The episode illustrates <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>: &#8220;After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.&#8221; David&#8217;s concealed adultery culminates in bloodshed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s sealed letter moves step by step from lust to lethal intent: writing the order, positioning Uriah in the worst fighting, commanding a calculated retreat, and ensuring death. Each phrase exposes deeper layers of betrayal, misuse of authority, and the spread of sin&#8217;s corruption. The verse stands as a sober reminder that unchecked desire leads to deliberate wickedness, but God will ultimately expose and judge every hidden scheme.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Retire ye from him.</span>--This part of David's orders was not carried out. Perhaps Joab thought it would make the stratagem too evident, or perhaps it was impracticable. At all events, the consequence was that others were slain with Uriah, and thus a larger blood-guiltiness fell upon David.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the letter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bas&#183;s&#234;&#183;p&#772;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
