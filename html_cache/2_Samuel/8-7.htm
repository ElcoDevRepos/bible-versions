Gold shields symbolize wealth and military strength. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, shields were not only used for protection but also as symbols of power and prestige. The taking of these shields signifies a transfer of power and the spoils of war, demonstrating God's favor upon David's reign.<p><b>that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer</b><br>Hadadezer was a powerful king whose officers would have been high-ranking military leaders. The mention of officers indicates the organized military structure of Zobah. By capturing these shields, David effectively dismantles a part of Hadadezer's military might. This act also fulfills God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies, as seen in earlier scriptures where God assures David of success in battle.<p><b>and brought them to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, becomes the repository for these symbols of victory. This act signifies the centralization of power and the unification of the nation under David's rule. Bringing the spoils to Jerusalem also foreshadows the city's future as the site of the Temple, where treasures would be dedicated to God. This action can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings the spoils of victory over sin and death to the heavenly Jerusalem, establishing His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess, leadership, and heart for God.

God had already promised David success (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>), and verse 6 emphasizes that &#8220;the LORD gave David victory wherever he went.&#8221; Here we see that assurance playing out in real time. The verb is simple, but it underscores:<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s personal involvement&#8212;no proxy warriors here, just the shepherd-king gathering the spoils he has legitimately won (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50&#8211;51</a>).<p>&#8226; The fulfillment of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness&#8212;every triumph flows from His hand (<a href="/psalms/144-10.htm">Psalm 144:10</a>).<p>&#8226; A clear contrast with Saul&#8217;s failures&#8212;where Saul spared what God forbade (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>), David takes what God delivers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the gold shields</b><p>The phrase highlights both value and symbolism: shields speak of protection and gold speaks of prestige. These were not everyday military issue; they signified royal status, much like Solomon&#8217;s later gold shields (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16&#8211;17</a>). Collecting them means:<p>&#8226; David is stripping Hadadezer&#8217;s court of its honor (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a> repeats the detail).<p>&#8226; Israel now holds tangible proof of God&#8217;s supremacy over foreign powers (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; The wealth of the nations is beginning to flow toward Zion, foreshadowing Temple splendour under Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer</b><p>Hadadezer, king of Zobah, had stretched his power &#8220;to restore his control at the Euphrates&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>). By seizing the personal armory of his commanders, David:<p>&#8226; Demonstrates total victory&#8212;he is not just pushing back an invasion, he is dismantling the leadership structure (<a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Prevents future rebellion&#8212;without elite weapons, Hadadezer&#8217;s officers cannot easily regroup (<a href="/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15&#8211;19</a> shows how lingering alliances could still threaten).<p>&#8226; Fulfills God&#8217;s promise to give Israel &#8220;rest from all [its] enemies&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought them to Jerusalem</b><p>The journey ends in Zion, the city David had recently captured (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7&#8211;9</a>).

Solomon's shields were ultimately carried off by Shishak (<a href="/context/1_kings/14-25.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:">1Kings 14:25-28</a>). The LXX. has here a curious addition, saying that Shishak carried off the shields which David captured, a manifest error, since those were made by Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shields of gold.</span> Probably they were plated with gold, and were borne by Hadarezer's bodyguard. But it is very uncertain whether shields are really meant. The word in Syriac means "quivers." Jerome evidently could not at first find out what it signified, as he in this place translates in the Vulgate "arms," but subsequently he became better, informed. The LXX. renders "bracelets," and adds that they were carried away from Jerusalem by Shishak in the days of Rehoboam. There is no contradiction in this with what is said in <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>, as what Solomon made were undoubtedly shields, such being the certain meaning of the word in the Hebrew, and its rendering in all the versions. No version renders the word used here "shield." In the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>) the Syriac and Vulgate render it "quivers," the LXX. "collars," and the Arabic "plates of gold hung on the trappings of the horses." As they were captured from a Syrian king, they probably retained their Syriac name, and if so they were "quivers." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
