This reflects the tension within the house of Saul after his death. Abner's anger indicates the fragile nature of Ish-bosheth's rule and the internal strife that plagued Saul's dynasty. The accusation likely involved a serious breach of trust or honor, which was a significant issue in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>&#8220;Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah?&#8221; he asked.</b><br>The phrase "head of a dog" was a derogatory term in ancient Israel, implying worthlessness or contempt. Dogs were considered unclean animals, and this metaphor suggests Abner felt deeply insulted. The mention of Judah highlights the tribal divisions and rivalries, as Judah was the tribe of David, Saul's rival. This reflects the political tension between the northern tribes loyal to Saul's house and the southern tribe of Judah, loyal to David.<p><b>&#8220;All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends.</b><br>Abner emphasizes his loyalty to Saul's family, underscoring his role in maintaining the kingdom after Saul's death. His loyalty extended beyond Saul to his brothers and allies, indicating a broader network of support. This loyalty was crucial in the power dynamics of the time, as familial and tribal allegiances were central to political stability.<p><b>I have not delivered you into the hand of David,</b><br>Abner's statement reveals his power and influence, as he had the capability to shift allegiance to David but chose not to. This highlights the precarious position of Ish-bosheth, who relied heavily on Abner's support to maintain his rule. It also foreshadows the eventual transfer of power to David, as Abner's allegiance was a key factor in the political landscape.<p><b>but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!</b><br>The accusation likely involved Rizpah, Saul's concubine, which would have been seen as a claim to Saul's throne. In the ancient Near East, taking a king's concubine was a political act, symbolizing a claim to his authority. This accusation threatened Abner's honor and position, prompting his anger and eventual decision to support David. This incident reflects the complex interplay of personal relationships and political power in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army and a powerful figure in Israel.

Ish-bosheth&#8217;s mistrust severs Abner&#8217;s allegiance, setting in motion the reunification of Israel under David&#8212;showing how unfounded accusations can unravel kingdoms, while God&#8217;s sovereign plan for David&#8217;s throne moves forward unhindered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Am I a dog's head?</span>--The translation of this clause is taken from the Vulg., and is hardly possible; it should rather be, <span class= "ital">Am I a dog's head belonging to Judah?</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was Abner very wroth.</span> This extreme indignation on Abner's part is not easy to understand; for he could scarcely have expected Ishbosheth to endure quietly what at least was a great insult. But probably the question, <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</span> does not mean a mild expostulation on the king's part, but the purpose to degrade Abner and strip him of his office. Probably after the defeat by Joab at Gibeon, the army was less satisfied with its leader, and his detractors may gladly have encouraged the king to use this opportunity for bringing Abner down to his proper place. Weak kings often try to play the strong man; but the attempt here only drove the imperious soldier to put the matter to the proof, and show that the strength was his. We know that David groaned all his life through under Joab's iron will, and, though he tried, yet that he never succeeded in throwing off the yoke. But Joab never behaved unfaithfully to his sovereign as Abner did here, and his crimes were deeds of violence committed in David's cause. <span class="cmt_word">Am I a dog's head, which against Judah, etc.?</span> The words literally are, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that is for Judah?</span> and are rightly rendered in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah?</span> Am I at once worthless and a traitor, a thing of no account, and on the side of thy enemies?
