In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/14.htm">2 Samuel 14</a>, this woman is part of a parable told by Joab to King David. The use of "please" reflects the cultural norms of addressing a king with respect and deference, which was common in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>&#8220;may the king invoke the LORD your God&#8221;</b><br>The invocation of the LORD signifies a request for divine intervention or blessing. In ancient Israel, the king was seen as God's representative, and invoking God in decisions was a way to seek divine justice and wisdom. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where God was central to governance and justice.<p><b>to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing the devastation,</b><br>The concept of the "avenger of blood" is rooted in the Mosaic Law, where a family member had the right to avenge the death of a relative (<a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>). This system was intended to maintain justice but could lead to cycles of violence. The woman's plea is to prevent further bloodshed, highlighting the tension between justice and mercy, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>so that my son may not be destroyed!&#8221;</b><br>This plea for the son's life underscores the value of mercy and forgiveness. It reflects the biblical principle of sparing life and seeking reconciliation, which is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized forgiveness over retribution (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>).<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives,&#8221; he vowed,</b><br>This oath formula is a solemn declaration, invoking God's eternal nature as a witness to the promise. It was a common way to affirm truth and commitment in ancient Israel, emphasizing the seriousness of the vow. The phrase underscores the king's role as a judge who must uphold divine justice.<p><b>&#8220;not a hair of your son&#8217;s head will fall to the ground.&#8221;</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom meaning complete protection and safety. It assures the woman of the king's promise to protect her son from harm. This phrase is reminiscent of God's protection over His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a> and <a href="/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a>, where divine safeguarding is promised.

Practically, the verse calls believers to seek God&#8217;s mercy, trust His justice, and rest in the absolute security offered by the living Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Let the king remember the Lord.</span>--Having thus far succeeded, the crafty woman still <span class= "ital">further </span>leads on the king to bind himself with the solemnity of an oath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee, let the king remember,</span> etc. Thenius says that the woman plays well the part of a talkative gossip, but really she was using the skill for which Joab employed her in bringing the king to give her son a free pardon. Nothing short of this would serve Absalom, who already was so far forgiven as to be in no fear of actual punishment. It is remarkable that David does not hesitate finally to grant this without making further inquiry, though he must have known that a mother's pleas were not likely to be very impartial. Moreover, while in ver. 9 she had acknowledged that there might be a breach of the law in pardoning a murderer, she now appeals to the mercy of Jehovah, who had himself provided limits to the anger of the avenger of blood (see <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.). He had thus shown himself to be a God of equity, in whom mercy triumphed over the rigid enactments of law. The words which follow more exactly mean, "That the avenger of blood do not multiply destruction, and that they destroy not my son." Moved by this entreaty, the king grants her son full pardon, under the solemn guaranty of an oath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Please,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
