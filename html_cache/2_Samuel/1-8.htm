Saul, the first king of Israel, is mortally wounded after a battle with the Philistines. The question "Who are you?" reflects Saul's desperate situation and his need to identify the person who has approached him. In biblical narratives, questions of identity often reveal deeper themes of loyalty, enmity, and divine purpose. Saul's inquiry can be seen as a moment of vulnerability, highlighting the tragic end of his reign. The question also sets the stage for the revelation of the Amalekite's identity, which is significant given the historical enmity between Israel and the Amalekites, as seen in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<p><b>So I told him, &#8216;I am an Amalekite.&#8217;</b><br>The Amalekite's response is crucial in understanding the narrative's unfolding. The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, and their mention here evokes the memory of past conflicts, such as the battle in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a> and Saul's incomplete obedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, where he failed to fully destroy the Amalekites as God commanded. This failure ultimately contributed to Saul's downfall. The Amalekite's presence at Saul's death is ironic and symbolic, representing the consequences of Saul's disobedience. Additionally, the Amalekite's claim to have killed Saul (though the biblical text suggests Saul took his own life) raises questions about his motives and the veracity of his account. This moment foreshadows David's reaction, as David, who respects God's anointed, will later execute the Amalekite for claiming to have killed Saul, demonstrating David's reverence for God's chosen king and his understanding of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was wounded in battle against the Philistines.

Scripture often records pivotal moments beginning with the search for identity&#8212;Isaac&#8217;s trembling &#8220;Who are you, my son?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-18.htm">Genesis 27:18-24</a>), or the Jerusalem delegation pressing John the Baptist, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-22.htm">John 1:22</a>). Each time, the question forces the hearer either to own the truth or to cloak himself in deception. Here Saul&#8217;s words underscore personal accountability before a dying monarch and, ultimately, before God (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he asked.</b><p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us that even a dying king retains authority enough to demand an answer, much like Saul earlier demanded, &#8220;Abner, whose son is this young man?&#8221; when David stepped forward (<a href="/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>). Inquiry is a God-given tool of discernment; David himself will soon question another stranger, the abandoned Egyptian slave, &#8220;To whom do you belong, and where are you from?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-13.htm">1 Samuel 30:13</a>). In every case, the question exposes motives and sets the stage for righteous judgment (<a href="/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I told him,</b><p>&#8226; The Amalekite claims straightforwardness, yet his entire story will soon be unmasked by David&#8217;s cross-examination (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>). His willingness to speak mirrors many biblical moments when words determine destiny&#8212;think of Stephen recounting Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>) or Paul declaring, &#8220;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>). Scripture treats speech seriously: &#8220;Lying lips are detestable to the LORD, but those who deal faithfully are His delight&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). The phrase signals that a testimony is being entered into record, carrying weight before the Lord of truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am an Amalekite.</b><p>&#8226; With this confession, the man identifies himself with a people long under divine judgment: &#8220;The LORD will be at war against Amalek from generation to generation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>). Saul himself had been commanded to annihilate Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a>); his failure cost him the kingdom (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). Now, in a tragic twist, an Amalekite stands over Saul in his final hour. For David, hearing the name &#8220;Amalekite&#8221; instantly frames the man as an enemy of Israel and of God&#8217;s covenant purposes, explaining David&#8217;s swift verdict in <a href="/2_samuel/1-15.htm">2 Samuel 1:15-16</a>. The statement also reveals the futility of Saul&#8217;s earlier compromise&#8212;what he spared has now contributed to his demise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8</a> captures layers of meaning in four short clauses: a dying king&#8217;s demand for identity, the solemn weight of testimony, and the shocking revelation that the speaker belongs to a nation God had marked for judgment. The verse accents God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word, the seriousness of truthful confession, and the inevitable consequences when divine commands are neglected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">An Amalekite.</span>--The Amalekites were hereditary foes of Israel, having attacked them on their first coming out of Egypt (<a href="/context/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8-13</a>), and at different times afterwards in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm" title="How he met you by the way, and smote the hindmost of you, even all that were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he feared not God.">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>). During the period of the judges they had also repeatedly joined the foes of Israel (<a href="/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>), but some years before this they had been terribly defeated by Saul (<a href="/context/1_samuel/15-4.htm" title="And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.">1Samuel 15:4-9</a>). and it is possible that the present messenger may either have attached himself to the army of the conqueror, or have been compelled, according to ancient custom, to serve in its ranks. One of their bands had also just received a severe blow at the hands of David, but of this last attack the Amalekite could not have known. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are you?&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;t&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">So I told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I am</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1469;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an Amalekite.&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#234;&#183;q&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6003.htm">Strong's 6003: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amalekites -- descendants of Amalek</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/2_samuel/1-8.htm">2 Samuel 1:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/2_samuel/1-8.htm">OT History: 2 Samuel 1:8 He said to me Who are you?
