This reflects David's intention to show peace and goodwill, contrasting the typical fate of a deposed king's descendants in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where new kings often eliminated potential rivals.<p><b>&#8220;for surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan.&#8221;</b><br>David's promise to show kindness is rooted in the covenant he made with Jonathan, Saul's son, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>. This covenant was based on mutual loyalty and love, and David's actions here demonstrate his faithfulness to that promise. The Hebrew word for "kindness" is "chesed," which implies steadfast love and mercy, reflecting God's covenantal love for His people.<p><b>I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul,</b><br>Restoring Saul's land to Mephibosheth is significant because it represents the return of Saul's estate and honor to his lineage. This act of restoration is a powerful gesture of grace and generosity, as David had no obligation to do so. It also reflects the biblical theme of restoration and redemption, seen throughout Scripture, where God restores what is lost or broken (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>).<p><b>and you will always eat at my table.&#8221;</b><br>Eating at the king's table signifies a place of honor and acceptance, akin to being part of the royal family. This privilege not only provided for Mephibosheth's physical needs but also restored his dignity and status. It is a type of the Messianic banquet, where believers are invited to dine with Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).

David&#8217;s kindness to Mephibosheth points to the far greater kindness God shows us in Christ&#8212;fear is banished, our inheritance is restored, and we are seated at the King&#8217;s table forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the land of Saul thy father.</span> David probably restored to Mephibosheth not only the lands at Gibeah, which Ziba had managed to hold, but Saul's estates generally. There seems, nevertheless, to have been on Ziba's part a grudge against Mephibosheth for thus getting back from the king what he had hoped to keep as his own. The privilege of being the king's friend, and eating at his table, was an honour that would be more highly prized than even the possession of the estates. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be afraid,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
