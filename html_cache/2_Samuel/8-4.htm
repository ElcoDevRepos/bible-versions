Chariots were a significant military asset in ancient warfare, often used by powerful nations like Egypt and the Hittites. Capturing a thousand chariots indicates a substantial victory over the enemy, showcasing David's ability to neutralize a formidable threat. This victory aligns with God's promise to give Israel rest from its enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).<p><b>seven thousand charioteers</b><br>The capture of seven thousand charioteers further emphasizes the scale of David's triumph. Charioteers were skilled warriors, and their capture would have been a significant blow to the enemy's military capabilities. This victory demonstrates God's favor upon David, fulfilling the covenantal promises of protection and success (<a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>).<p><b>and twenty thousand foot soldiers</b><br>The capture of twenty thousand foot soldiers underscores the magnitude of the battle and the comprehensive nature of David's victory. Foot soldiers formed the backbone of ancient armies, and their capture would have severely weakened the enemy's ability to wage war. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make David's name great and to establish his kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>).<p><b>and he hamstrung all the horses</b><br>Hamstringing horses was a common practice in ancient warfare to render them useless for battle without killing them. This action demonstrates David's strategic thinking, ensuring that the enemy could not quickly regroup and retaliate. It also reflects adherence to God's instructions in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, which cautioned against amassing horses, a symbol of reliance on military might rather than on God.<p><b>except a hundred he kept for the chariots</b><br>By keeping a hundred horses, David maintained a limited but effective chariot force for his own military use. This decision reflects a balance between practical military needs and obedience to divine guidance. It also symbolizes David's reliance on God rather than on military strength alone, aligning with the biblical theme of trusting in God's provision and protection (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and devotion to God.

The verse showcases the LORD&#8217;s faithfulness, David&#8217;s reliance on divine rather than military might, and the fulfillment of covenant promises to exalt His people while keeping their trust firmly in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A thousand chariots.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">chariots </span>has evidently dropped out of the text here, but is rightly inserted, following the LXX. and 1 Chron.; 700 horsemen should also be changed to 7,000, in accordance with 1 Chron., this being a more fitting proportion to 20,000 infantry in the plains of Syria, and the difference being only in two dots over the letter marking the numeral in Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Houghed,</span> i.e., hamstrung, to render them incapable of use in war. (Comp. <a href="/joshua/11-6.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a>.) This is meant to apply not only to the chariot horses, but to all those of the cavalry. Whether David's reservation of the number needed for 100 chariots was wrong or not, is not said. David probably felt the need of these horses as a means of more rapid communication with the distant parts of his increasing empire; yet this act may have been the entering wedge for Solomon's direct violation of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, by sending to Egypt to "multiply horses to himself."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen.</span> The word "chariots" is inserted in the Authorized Version after "thousand," from the parallel place in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>, where also it is said that David captured seven thousand horsemen. The numbers of the Chronicler are more in proportion to one another than those mentioned here, provided we assume that the word "chariots" ought to be supplied, which, as it is not the only difference, is uncertain. Until the Arabs invented our present system of notation, the ancient methods of representing numbers were so liable to error that little dependence can be placed upon them. The Hebrews used their letters for numerals, but after 400 their system breaks down. Any number higher than 400 can be represented only by long sums in arithmetic, or by an intricate system of points above and below, which were sure to get into confusion. <span class="cmt_word">David houghed all the chariot</span> <span class="cmt_word">horses</span>. There is good reason for concluding that the word used here, <span class="accented">recheb</span>, is a collective, and signifies animals used either for riding or driving. What David reserved was not a hundred chariots, but a hundred riding horses, which would be useful to him for rapid communication, and could scarcely be regarded as a violation of the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. Both the Authorized and Revised Versions are wrong, but the Authorized Version at least makes the word <span class="accented">recheb</span> have the same meaning in both clauses, whereas the Revised Version makes it signify chariot horses in the first clause, and the chariots themselves in the second. The defeat by David, with infantry only, of an army provided with so powerful a force of cavalry and chariots, proves his great military skill, and their capture hears even more emphatic testimony to his generalship. In the Psalms we find horses often referred to as objects regarded with terror, and which gave a great advantage to their enemies (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but over which they had triumphed by Jehovah's aid. This method, however, of rendering them useless, though practised by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a>), was most cruel; as the poor things, unable to move about with the sinews of their hind legs severed, would perish of hunger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1436;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">captured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;k&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
