His infatuation with his half-sister Tamar, the daughter of David and Maacah, reveals the complexities of familial relationships within the royal household. The term "sick with frustration" indicates an intense emotional turmoil, highlighting the destructive nature of unchecked desires. This situation foreshadows the tragic events that follow, illustrating the consequences of sin and lack of self-control. The narrative sets the stage for the unfolding drama within David's family, which ultimately leads to further strife and division.<p><b>for she was a virgin</b><br>Tamar's virginity is significant in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where a woman's purity was highly valued and protected. Her status as a virgin daughter of the king underscores the gravity of Amnon's obsession and the potential dishonor to the royal family. This detail also emphasizes the violation of social and moral boundaries that Amnon contemplates, reflecting the broader biblical theme of the sanctity of sexual relations within the covenant of marriage.<p><b>and it seemed implausible for him to do anything to her</b><br>The phrase "it seemed implausible" suggests that Amnon recognized the barriers to acting on his desires, whether due to social norms, legal restrictions, or moral considerations. This acknowledgment of the impossibility of his intentions highlights the internal conflict between his desires and the reality of the situation. The narrative tension here points to the broader biblical theme of temptation and the struggle between fleshly desires and righteous living. It also foreshadows the tragic decisions that Amnon will make, leading to devastating consequences for himself and his family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The firstborn son of King David, who becomes infatuated with his half-sister Tamar.
