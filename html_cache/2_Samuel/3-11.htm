His influence was significant, and he held considerable sway over the northern tribes. The fear Ish-bosheth had for Abner highlights the political instability and the power dynamics at play during this period. Abner's role as a kingmaker is evident, as he was instrumental in establishing Ish-bosheth as king over Israel after Saul's death. This fear also underscores the lack of true authority Ish-bosheth had, as he was reliant on Abner's support to maintain his rule.<p><b>Ish-bosheth did not dare</b><br>Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was a weak and indecisive leader, contrasting sharply with David's strong and charismatic leadership. His inability to confront Abner shows his lack of confidence and authority. This phrase reflects the internal conflict within the house of Saul and the challenges Ish-bosheth faced in asserting his kingship. The political tension between Ish-bosheth and Abner foreshadows the eventual decline of Saul's dynasty and the rise of David as the undisputed king of Israel.<p><b>to say another word to him</b><br>This indicates a complete submission to Abner's authority, highlighting the imbalance of power between the two. Ish-bosheth's silence can be seen as a strategic move to avoid conflict, but it also reveals his dependency on Abner. This dynamic is crucial in understanding the eventual shift of power to David, as Abner later defects to David's side, further weakening Ish-bosheth's position. The inability to speak against Abner also reflects the broader theme of God's providence in establishing David's kingdom, as the internal strife within Saul's house paves the way for David's ascension.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ish-bosheth.htm">Ish-bosheth</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, who was made king over Israel by Abner after Saul's death.

Similar moments of intimidation appear when men quail before a powerful leader rather than trust the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>; <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The text presents fear as a decisive motive: Ish-bosheth is not persuaded by truth, but paralyzed by dread of the man who holds the swords.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ish-bosheth did not dare</b><p>&#8226; Ish-bosheth is king in name, but Abner is the real power broker.
