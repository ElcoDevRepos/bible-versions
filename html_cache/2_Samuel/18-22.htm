Zadok was a loyal supporter of David, and his family held significant religious influence in Israel. Ahimaaz, as a priestly figure, would have been well-respected and trusted, which is why he was often involved in delivering messages. His lineage connects him to the priestly duties and the spiritual leadership of Israel, highlighting the intertwining of religious and political roles in ancient Israel.<p><b>however, persisted and said to Joab</b><br>Ahimaaz's persistence indicates his eagerness and determination to be involved in the events unfolding around King David's reign. Joab, the commander of David's army, was a key military leader, and his interactions with Ahimaaz show the close relationship between military and religious leaders. This persistence can be seen as a reflection of Ahimaaz's loyalty and desire to serve David, paralleling the dedication expected of followers of God.<p><b>&#8220;No matter what, please let me also run behind the Cushite!&#8221;</b><br>The Cushite was likely an Ethiopian messenger, chosen by Joab to deliver news to King David. Ahimaaz's request to run behind the Cushite suggests a desire to be part of the communication process, possibly to ensure the message was delivered accurately or to share in the honor of delivering important news. This reflects the cultural importance of messengers in ancient times, where delivering news was a prestigious task. The mention of the Cushite also highlights the diversity within David's ranks, showing the inclusion of foreigners in his service.<p><b>&#8220;My son,&#8221; Joab replied</b><br>Joab's use of "my son" indicates a paternal or mentoring relationship with Ahimaaz, suggesting familiarity and perhaps affection. This term of endearment shows Joab's protective nature over Ahimaaz, possibly reflecting the close-knit community among David's followers. It also underscores the hierarchical structure within David's administration, where younger men were guided by seasoned leaders.<p><b>&#8220;why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?&#8221;</b><br>Joab questions Ahimaaz's motivation, pointing out that there would be no tangible benefit for him. This highlights the theme of selfless service, where actions are taken not for personal gain but out of duty or loyalty. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a reflection of the Christian call to serve God and others without seeking earthly rewards, aligning with teachings found in the New Testament about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>The son of Zadok, a priest, known for his swiftness and eagerness to deliver messages.

He likely assumes David will receive him kindly because of past trust (<a href="/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19</a>).<p>&#8226; His words hint at self-forgetful devotion: &#8220;No matter what.&#8221;

the assassins in <a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; It reflects seasoned caution: Joab knows David often rewards loyalty but punishes bearers of tragic tidings even if truth-telling (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

The scene teaches that zeal must count the cost; even service for God can involve personal loss (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahimaaz&#8217;s eagerness shows a servant&#8217;s heart willing to run without promise of reward, while Joab&#8217;s caution reminds us that good intentions need wise discernment. The verse challenges believers to examine motives, submit to godly authority, and serve the Lord whether or not earthly recognition follows, trusting that true reward comes from God alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">No tidings ready.</span>--The phrase is a difficult one, and is translated by the LXX. "no tidings leading to profit," and by the Vulg. "thou wilt not be a bearer of good tidings." The simplest and most probable sense is "no tidings sufficient" for a special messenger; the Cushite had already carried the news.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing... thou hast no tidings ready.</span> This was not true; there were most important tidings ready. But it is the translation which is in fault. What Joab said is, "Seeing thou hast no tidings that find," that is, no message that will find for thee the king's favour and a reward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ahimaaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_290.htm">Strong's 290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahimaaz -- 'my brother is wrath', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Zadok,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6659.htm">Strong's 6659: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zadok -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">however, persisted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
