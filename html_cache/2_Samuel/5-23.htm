For the Revised Version translates "valley of weeping," concluding that <span class="accented">baca</span> is not there a proper name. By baca trees the LXX. and Vulgate "pear trees," but as <span class="accented">bacah</span> means "to weep," it is probably some balsamic shrub, from which a resin exudes. The Revised Version puts here in the margin, "balsam trees." Dr. Tristram thinks it was a sort of aspen, but the authority of the Vulgate is great in such matters, as Jerome obtained his information in Palestine itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inquired</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#8217;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
