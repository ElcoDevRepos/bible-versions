In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/20.htm">2 Samuel 20</a>, Joab, David's military commander, is addressing the people of the city of Abel Beth Maacah. The situation involves a rebellion led by Sheba, and Joab is making it clear that his intent is not to destroy the city but to deal with the rebel.<p><b>But a man named Sheba son of Bichri,</b><br>Sheba is identified as the instigator of the rebellion against King David. He is described as a "worthless man" earlier in the chapter, indicating his character and the threat he poses. His lineage, "son of Bichri," ties him to the tribe of Benjamin, which had historical tensions with the tribe of Judah, David's tribe.<p><b>from the hill country of Ephraim,</b><br>This geographical reference is significant as it situates Sheba within the northern tribes of Israel. Ephraim was a powerful tribe and often seen as a leader among the northern tribes. This location underscores the division between the northern and southern tribes, a recurring theme in Israel's history.<p><b>has lifted up his hand against the king, against David.</b><br>"Lifting up his hand" is a phrase denoting rebellion or insurrection. Sheba's actions are a direct challenge to David's authority as king. This rebellion follows the earlier revolt of Absalom, David's son, highlighting the ongoing instability in David's reign and the challenges to his kingship.<p><b>Deliver him alone, and I will depart from the city.&#8221;</b><br>Joab's demand is straightforward: hand over Sheba, and the city will be spared. This reflects a common practice in ancient warfare where a single individual could be sacrificed to save a larger group. It also shows Joab's strategic thinking, focusing on the root of the problem rather than unnecessary destruction.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; the woman replied, &#8220;his head will be thrown to you over the wall.&#8221;</b><br>The wise woman's response demonstrates her quick thinking and leadership. By agreeing to Joab's terms, she acts to protect her city. The act of throwing Sheba's head over the wall is a graphic but effective way to show compliance and resolve the conflict.
