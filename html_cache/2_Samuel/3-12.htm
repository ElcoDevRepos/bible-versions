His decision to send messengers to David indicates a significant political move. This action follows a dispute with Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, which led Abner to shift his allegiance. The use of messengers highlights the formal and diplomatic nature of this communication, common in ancient Near Eastern politics. Abner's initiative reflects his recognition of David's growing power and God's anointing of David as king, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>.<p><b>To whom does the land belong?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the political tension and the struggle for control over Israel. It implies a challenge to Ish-bosheth's legitimacy and suggests that the rightful ruler should be the one who can unite and govern the land effectively. The land of Israel, promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), is central to the covenantal promises and the identity of the nation. Abner's question hints at the divine right of kingship, which David embodies as God's chosen leader.<p><b>Make your covenant with me</b><br>Covenants in the ancient Near East were binding agreements that often included political alliances. Abner's proposal for a covenant with David signifies a shift in loyalty and a strategic alliance. This covenant would not only solidify David's claim to the throne but also bring about the unification of the northern tribes with Judah. The concept of covenant is foundational in the Bible, reflecting God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, and David himself (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and surely my hand will be with you</b><br>Abner's promise of support is significant given his military prowess and influence. His backing would provide David with the necessary strength to consolidate his rule over all Israel. This phrase indicates a transfer of power and allegiance, which is crucial for David's kingship. The imagery of the "hand" often symbolizes power and action in biblical texts, as seen in God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>).<p><b>to bring all Israel over to you</b><br>Abner's offer to bring all Israel under David's rule fulfills the divine promise of a united kingdom under David's leadership. This unification is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, setting the stage for the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center. It also prefigures the messianic kingdom, where Jesus, a descendant of David, will reign over a united people (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The phrase reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David and the foreshadowing of Christ's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army and a powerful figure in Israel.

His decision to negotiate with David shows a dramatic shift in allegiance.<p>&#8226; By sending messengers rather than going himself, Abner tests David&#8217;s willingness while protecting himself from immediate danger (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-20.htm">2 Samuel 3:20</a>, where he later appears in person).<p>&#8226; God had already promised the kingdom to David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Abner&#8217;s move, though politically motivated, unwittingly advances the divine plan (<a href="/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom does the land belong?</b><p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical; Abner knows the answer is &#8220;David.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It acknowledges that the whole land&#8212;&#8220;from Dan to Beersheba&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>)&#8212;rightfully belongs under the anointed king. Compare Israel&#8217;s earlier recognition of David&#8217;s victories (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a>) and the elders&#8217; later confession, &#8220;You were the one who led Israel out and back&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The land ultimately belongs to the LORD, who assigns it to whomever He chooses (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Abner&#8217;s words align, perhaps unintentionally, with God&#8217;s sovereign allocation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Make your covenant with me</b><p>&#8226; A covenant is a solemn, binding agreement. Abner is asking David to formalize their alliance.<p>&#8226; David has a history of covenant-making for kingdom purposes&#8212;Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>), the elders of Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>), and later all Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Bullet points on what Abner offers:<p>&#8211; Military experience and influence over Saul&#8217;s former forces.<p>&#8211; Political leverage with the elders he had previously persuaded to follow Ish-bosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>).<p>&#8211; A pathway to a peaceful, unified kingdom rather than extended civil war.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s eventual agreement (<a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm">2 Samuel 3:13</a>) shows wisdom in embracing reconciliation without compromising God&#8217;s promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surely my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over to you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;My hand&#8221; signals Abner&#8217;s active, personal involvement. His authority carried weight; the tribes had followed his lead before (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s pledge echoes earlier prophecies: Samuel&#8217;s anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>) and Abigail&#8217;s assurance that David would rule over Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>).<p>&#8226; God often uses unexpected agents&#8212;even one formerly hostile&#8212;to fulfill His word (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The outcome: Abner rallies the elders (<a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17-18</a>) and begins the process that culminates in &#8220;all the tribes of Israel&#8221; coming to David at Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abner&#8217;s message marks the turning point in Israel&#8217;s civil conflict. By acknowledging David&#8217;s rightful claim, seeking covenant, and pledging to deliver the nation, Abner moves the story from division toward the God-ordained unity of Israel under David&#8217;s throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Whose is the land?</span>--These words in themselves may be understood in either of two senses: (1) "Is not the land thine by promise?" or (2) "Who has the power to bring the land into subjection to whom he will except myself?" Since the question is put forward as the basis for making a league with Abner, the latter is evidently the sense intended, and it is quite in accordance with the pride and haughtiness of Abner's character. He proposes a league, that he may have a definite assurance of consideration for himself, and he makes this the price of exerting his influence on David's behalf. The repetition of the word "saying" has occasioned some difficulty to the commentators, but this disappears when it is remembered that the two clauses are separate parts of Abner's message. His messengers were charged first to represent the importance of Abner's influence, and then afterwards to say that he would exert it for David for a satisfactory consideration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">under him.</span> The Revised Version renders this "where he was;" but the phrase really means "immediately" (see note on ch. 2:23). And this agrees with the haughty temper of Abner. Without waiting for advice, or allowing his anger to cool, he at once sent trusty envoys to open negotiations with David. <span class="cmt_word">Whose is the land?</span> Abner's meaning in these words is plain. You, David, he seems to say, will answer that the land is mine; for Jehovah has promised it to me. But, as a matter of fact, much of the land is mine (Abner's), or at least belongs to the house of Saul, whose prime minister I am. Yours is an abstract right; mine is actual possession. Come, let us make the two agree. Give me fitting assurances of safety and reward, and I will make your claim a reality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
