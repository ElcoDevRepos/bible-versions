Amasa, who had been appointed by David as commander of the army in place of Joab, lies dead, having been killed by Joab. This act of violence underscores the political tension and power struggles within the kingdom. Joab's young man standing near Amasa signifies loyalty to Joab, despite the king's orders, reflecting the complex dynamics of leadership and allegiance in ancient Israel.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Whoever favors Joab,</b><br>The call to favor Joab suggests a division of loyalty among the troops. Joab, a seasoned military leader, had a strong following due to his past successes and his role in securing David's throne. This appeal to favor Joab over Amasa, who was appointed by David, indicates Joab's attempt to consolidate power and maintain his position. It reflects the broader theme of loyalty and the challenges of leadership transition, as seen throughout the narrative of David's reign.<p><b>and whoever is for David,</b><br>This phrase ties Joab's cause to King David, suggesting that supporting Joab is synonymous with supporting the king. It reflects the political strategy of aligning oneself with the reigning monarch to legitimize one's actions. The mention of David emphasizes the centrality of the king in the political and military affairs of Israel, and it highlights the tension between personal ambition and loyalty to the anointed king, a recurring theme in the books of Samuel.<p><b>let him follow Joab!&#8221;</b><br>The call to follow Joab is a direct appeal for action, urging the troops to align themselves with Joab's leadership. This command underscores Joab's assertive nature and his ability to rally support, even in the face of royal opposition. It also reflects the military culture of the time, where loyalty to a commander was crucial for cohesion and success in battle. The phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of following a leader, which can be seen in the New Testament call to follow Christ, drawing a parallel between earthly and spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

Time was too precious for Joab himself to wait. He must put down the rebellion of Sheba by rapid action, and thereby render himself impregnable in the high office which had been his, and which he had now again usurped. He left one of his trusty men, however, by the body of Amasa, with a battle cry which should suggest that he had rightly been put to death for his doubtful loyalty, and that all who were attached to Joab and loyal to David should follow Joab. Joab's real motive for murdering Amasa, as for murdering Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm" title="And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.">2Samuel 3:27</a>), was personal jealousy and ambition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of Joab's men.</span> Joab left one of his personal followers to prevent any halt of the people round Amasa's body, and to suggest that he was a traitor. For he was to say to them as they came up, not only that "whosoever had pleasure in Joab," but also that "all who were for David, were to go after Joab." All loyal men were to regard him as captain of the host, and to disobey him would be rebellion. Naturally they would conclude from this that Amasa had not really been true to David, and that his death was the punishment inflicted on him for his past guilt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
