This event underscores the holiness of the Ark and the importance of following God's instructions precisely. The Ark represented God's presence and was central to Israel's worship. David's fear and reverence for God are evident here, reflecting a deep respect for the divine holiness and the consequences of disobedience. The City of David, Jerusalem, was to become the political and spiritual center of Israel, and David's initial hesitation highlights the gravity of bringing the Ark to this significant location.<p><b>instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</b><br>Obed-edom, identified as a Gittite, suggests he was from Gath, a Philistine city, or possibly from Gath-rimmon, a Levitical city. His willingness to house the Ark indicates a reverence for God and a willingness to serve. The Ark's presence in his home brought blessings, as noted in subsequent verses (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>). This reflects the theme that God's presence brings blessing and prosperity to those who honor Him. Obed-edom's role foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan, as he was not an Israelite by birth. This act of housing the Ark also demonstrates God's grace and the extension of His blessings beyond the boundaries of Israel, prefiguring the New Testament revelation of salvation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, the City of David.

The shocking judgment impressed on David&#8212;and on us&#8212;the absolute holiness of God.<p>&#8226; Fear of the LORD, according to <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, is &#8220;the beginning of wisdom,&#8221; and David demonstrates that awakening fear. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/13-11.htm">1 Chronicles 13:11-12</a>, where he even names the place Perez-uzzah (&#8220;outburst against Uzzah&#8221;) to memorialize the lesson.<p>&#8226; The ark symbolized God&#8217;s throne on earth (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). Mishandling it was tantamount to irreverence toward God Himself (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; David pauses the project because he recognizes that good intentions never excuse disobedience. He had placed the ark on a cart (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>), copying Philistine practice (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-8</a>) instead of following the Levite carrying instructions (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment highlights God&#8217;s unchanging standard: He desires wholehearted worship, yet He also demands it be offered His way (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10</a>)<p>&#8226; Obed-edom, likely a Levite living near Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18, 24</a>; 26:4-8), welcomes the ark into his home. His willingness contrasts with David&#8217;s hesitation and demonstrates faith that God&#8217;s presence brings blessing when received with reverence.<p>&#8226; The next verse confirms that &#8220;the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household&#8221; during the three-month stay (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>). Blessing follows obedience, echoing <a href="/genesis/39-5.htm">Genesis 39:5</a> (Joseph) and <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-6</a> (the pure in heart receiving God&#8217;s favor).<p>&#8226; This temporary detour becomes a teaching moment for the nation: God&#8217;s holiness does not repel the faithful; it safeguards them. When handled rightly, His presence turns a household into a sanctuary of grace (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; David hears of the blessing (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>) and, encouraged, restarts the procession&#8212;this time with Levites carrying the ark on their shoulders and with sacrifices offered every six steps (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 13</a>-15). Obedience restores joy (<a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Obed-edom&#8217;s family is later assigned temple gatekeeping and musical duties (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>). Proximity to God&#8217;s presence shapes future generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s initial refusal to bring the ark to Jerusalem arises from a rightful fear after Uzzah&#8217;s judgment, underscoring God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness. Redirecting the ark to Obed-edom&#8217;s house reveals that the same holy presence that judges irreverence also showers blessing on those who honor God according to His word. The episode teaches that reverent obedience, not mere enthusiasm, invites God&#8217;s favor and advances His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Obed-edom the Gittite.</span>--He was a Levite, but whether of the family of Kohath or of Merari is uncertain, since at this time the name appears in both these families (see for Merari, <a href="/context/1_chronicles/15-17.htm" title="So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;">1Chronicles 15:17-18</a>, and for Kohath, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-8.htm" title="All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men for strength for the service, were three score and two of Obededom.">1Chronicles 26:8</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-13.htm" title="And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.">1Chronicles 26:13-15</a>).
