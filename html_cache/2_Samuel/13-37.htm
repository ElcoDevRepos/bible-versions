This act of vengeance and subsequent flight highlights the cycle of sin and retribution within David's family, reflecting the consequences of David's own sins. Absalom's escape is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for his eventual rebellion against David.<p><b>and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.</b><br>Geshur was a small Aramean kingdom located northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Absalom's maternal grandfather, Talmai, was the king of Geshur, providing Absalom a place of refuge. This connection underscores the political alliances through marriage that were common in ancient times. The alliance with Geshur through Absalom's mother, Maacah, illustrates the complex familial and political dynamics in David's reign.<p><b>But David mourned for his son every day.</b><br>David's mourning for Absalom reflects his deep paternal love and the personal turmoil he experiences due to the fracturing of his family. This mourning can be seen as a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy that the sword would never depart from David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>). David's grief also foreshadows the future sorrow he will endure due to Absalom's rebellion. The ongoing mourning signifies the unresolved nature of their relationship and the broader theme of familial discord in David's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.
