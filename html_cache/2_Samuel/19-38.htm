David's kingship is central to the narrative of 2 Samuel, highlighting his role as a leader chosen by God. His responses often reflect his character and the divine wisdom attributed to him. David's interactions with his subjects often reveal his diplomatic skills and his ability to maintain loyalty among his followers.<p><b>&#8220;Chimham will cross over with me</b><br>Chimham is likely the son of Barzillai, who had supported David during Absalom's rebellion. The phrase "cross over" indicates a transition or journey, possibly across the Jordan River, symbolizing a new beginning or alliance. This act of taking Chimham with him signifies David's gratitude and the continuation of Barzillai's legacy. It also reflects the cultural importance of loyalty and the passing of favor from one generation to the next.<p><b>and I will do for him what is good in your sight</b><br>David promises to honor Barzillai's wishes concerning Chimham, showing respect and gratitude. This reflects the biblical principle of honoring those who have shown kindness and loyalty. The phrase "what is good in your sight" suggests a personal and subjective standard, emphasizing the relational aspect of David's promise. It underscores the importance of fulfilling commitments and the value of personal integrity.<p><b>and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.&#8221;</b><br>David extends his promise to Barzillai himself, offering to fulfill any request. This demonstrates David's generosity and the reciprocal nature of relationships in biblical times. It also highlights the theme of covenant loyalty, where mutual support and faithfulness are expected. This promise can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers to fulfill the desires of those who follow Him, reflecting the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who is returning to Jerusalem after the rebellion of his son Absalom.
