This interaction occurs after the death of Saul, Israel's first king, and Jonathan, his son, in battle against the Philistines. David's question reflects his deep respect for God's chosen leaders, despite Saul's previous attempts to kill him. This moment highlights David's character and his adherence to God's authority, setting a precedent for leadership that values divine appointment over personal ambition.<p><b>&#8220;Why were you not afraid</b><br>David's question implies a moral and spiritual expectation that reverence for God's anointed should instill fear or respect. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were often seen as divinely appointed, and to harm them was to challenge divine authority. This reflects a broader biblical principle seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, which emphasizes submission to governing authorities as instituted by God.<p><b>to lift your hand</b><br>The phrase "lift your hand" is a Hebrew idiom for taking action, particularly violent action. It suggests a deliberate and conscious decision to harm. In biblical narratives, the hand often symbolizes power and action, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, where God's hand is described as powerful and victorious. Here, it underscores the gravity of the Amalekite's claim to have killed Saul.<p><b>to destroy the LORD&#8217;s anointed?&#8221;</b><br>The term "the LORD&#8217;s anointed" refers to Saul, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel as king over Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). Anointing with oil was a sacred act signifying God's choice and empowerment for leadership. This concept of anointing is a type of Christ, the Messiah, which means "Anointed One." David's respect for Saul, despite Saul's failings, foreshadows the ultimate respect and reverence due to Jesus Christ, God's anointed Savior. David's refusal to harm Saul, even when given the opportunity, is a testament to his understanding of God's sovereignty and the sanctity of God's chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his complex life of triumphs and failures.
