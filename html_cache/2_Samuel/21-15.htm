Their conflicts with Israel are documented throughout the books of Samuel, highlighting the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and their neighboring enemies. This phrase indicates a repeated cycle of conflict, suggesting the Philistines' determination to subdue Israel. Historically, the Philistines were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan, known for their military prowess and iron weaponry, which gave them an advantage in warfare.<p><b>and David and his servants went down and fought against the Philistines</b><br>David, as king, led his men into battle, demonstrating his role as both a military leader and a servant of God. His "servants" likely refer to his loyal warriors, including the mighty men mentioned in other parts of Samuel. This action reflects David's responsibility to protect Israel and fulfill his kingly duties. The phrase "went down" may indicate a descent from the hill country of Judah to the lower coastal plains where the Philistines resided, emphasizing the geographical movement necessary for battle.<p><b>But David became exhausted</b><br>David's exhaustion signifies his humanity and vulnerability, despite being a man after God's own heart. This moment of weakness contrasts with his earlier victories, such as his triumph over Goliath, another Philistine. It serves as a reminder of the physical and emotional toll of leadership and warfare. This exhaustion can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His humanity, experienced weariness and fatigue, yet continued to fulfill His mission. David's fatigue foreshadows the need for reliance on God's strength rather than human ability alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A recurring enemy of Israel, known for their conflicts with the Israelites throughout the Old Testament.

Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.">2Samuel 21:17</a> it is plain that it must have been after David had become king of all Israel, and probably after he had become somewhat advanced in years. In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/20-4.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.">1Chronicles 20:4-8</a> much the same paragraph is placed immediately after the war with Ammon; but this seems to be a mere juxta-position rather than designed as a chronological sequence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>. A new narrative begins here, and the heroic acts related in it are taken probably from some record of the martial deeds of David and his mighties. We have already seen that the Book of Jasher (<a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) was a national anthology, full of ballads and songs in praise of glorious exploits of Israel's worthies. The source of the narratives recorded here apparently was a history in prose, and commenced, perhaps, with David's own achievement in slaying Goliath - a deed which celled forth the heroism of the nation, and was emulated by other brave men. These extracts were probably given for their own sake, and are repeated in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, where they are placed immediately after the capture of Rabbah; but they here form an appropriate introduction to the psalm of thanksgiving in ch. 22. It was usual in Hebrew, in making quotations, to leave them without any attempt at adapting them to their new place; and thus the "moreover" and "yet again," which referred to some previous narrative in the history, are left unchanged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
