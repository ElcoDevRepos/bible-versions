Known for his striking appearance and charisma, he was a popular figure among the Israelites. His actions in this chapter reveal his ambition and cunning nature. Absalom's statement here is part of his strategy to undermine his father, King David, and gain favor with the people. This reflects the broader theme of rebellion and the consequences of familial discord, which are prevalent throughout the books of Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;Look, your claims are good and right</b><br>Absalom's approach is manipulative, as he acknowledges the validity of the people's grievances. By doing so, he positions himself as a sympathetic and just leader, contrasting himself with the current administration. This tactic is reminiscent of political strategies throughout history, where leaders gain support by aligning themselves with the common people's concerns. Biblically, this echoes the serpent's approach in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where truth is mixed with deceit to achieve a desired outcome.<p><b>but the king has no deputy to hear you.&#8221;</b><br>This statement implies a lack of justice and accessibility in King David's administration. In ancient Israel, the king was expected to be the ultimate judge and arbiter of disputes. Absalom's claim suggests a gap in leadership, which he seeks to exploit. Historically, this reflects the challenges of governance in a growing kingdom, where the central authority may struggle to address all issues effectively. Theologically, it underscores the need for righteous leadership, a theme that points forward to the perfect justice and governance of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King and Judge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

While claiming to champion justice, he actually subverts the God-given order, proving that unresolved ambition cloaked in empathy can lure a nation away from righteous authority. The verse thus cautions believers to discern motives behind persuasive speech and to trust the Lord&#8217;s appointed structures rather than charisma alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">There is no man deputed of the king.</span>--There is no official <span class= "ital">hearer </span>appointed.
