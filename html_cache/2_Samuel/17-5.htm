This moment occurs during a critical point in his attempt to seize the throne. Absalom's actions are driven by ambition and a desire for power, reflecting the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>, where God foretold that calamity would arise from within David's own house. Absalom's rebellion is a direct consequence of David's earlier sins, illustrating the principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Summon Hushai the Archite as well,</b><br>Hushai the Archite is a friend and loyal supporter of King David. His presence in Absalom's court is part of a strategic plan devised by David to counteract the counsel of Ahithophel, Absalom's advisor. The term "Archite" indicates Hushai's origin from the region of Archi, near Bethel, which is significant as it places him within the tribal territories of Ephraim or Benjamin. Hushai's role is crucial in the unfolding narrative, as he serves as a type of Christ in his loyalty and willingness to suffer for the sake of his king, paralleling Christ's loyalty to the Father.<p><b>and let us hear what he too has to say.&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's decision to consult Hushai demonstrates his desire to weigh multiple perspectives, though it ultimately reveals his lack of discernment. This moment is pivotal, as Hushai's counsel will lead to Absalom's downfall. The request to hear Hushai's opinion highlights the biblical theme of seeking wisdom and the importance of discerning godly counsel, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states that victory is found in an abundance of counselors. Hushai's advice, inspired by God, will counter Ahithophel's seemingly wise counsel, illustrating the sovereignty of God in directing the affairs of men to fulfill His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, who rebelled against his father and sought to take over the kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David, who infiltrated Absalom's court to act as a spy and counter the counsel of Ahithophel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A highly esteemed counselor whose advice was considered almost as if one had consulted the word of God.
