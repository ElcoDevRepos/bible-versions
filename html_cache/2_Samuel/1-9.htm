In the context of ancient warfare, it was not uncommon for a wounded soldier to request a swift death to avoid prolonged suffering or capture. This reflects the desperation and vulnerability of Saul, Israel's first king, who finds himself in a dire situation on the battlefield.<p><b>&#8216;Stand over me and kill me</b><br>The request to "stand over" suggests a position of dominance or authority, highlighting the power dynamics even in moments of vulnerability. Saul's request for death can be seen as an act of desperation, seeking to avoid the shame of being captured by the Philistines. This moment is significant as it marks the end of Saul's reign and the beginning of David's rise to power, fulfilling God's earlier anointing of David as king.<p><b>for agony has seized me</b><br>The term "agony" here refers to both physical pain and the emotional torment of defeat. Saul's suffering is a consequence of his disobedience to God, as seen in earlier chapters where he fails to fully carry out God's commands. This moment serves as a reminder of the consequences of straying from God's will.<p><b>but my life still lingers</b><br>Despite his severe injuries, Saul is still alive, indicating a prolonged suffering. This lingering life can be seen as a metaphor for Saul's prolonged struggle against God's plan for David to become king. It also reflects the tension between life and death, a common theme in biblical narratives, where God's sovereignty over life is emphasized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Each phrase exposes his tragic descent: abandoned on the battlefield, he pleads for an unlawful mercy killing, overwhelmed by suffering, yet still under God&#8217;s sovereign timing. The verse challenges us to honor God&#8217;s commandments even when pressured by desperate voices, to recognize that suffering does not justify sin, and to trust the Lord who alone appoints our first and last breath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Anguish is come upon me.</span>--The word for "anguish" occurs only here, and probably does not have either of the meanings given to it in the text and margin of our version. The Rabbis explain it of <span class= "ital">cramp, </span>others of <span class= "ital">giddiness, </span>and the ancient versions differ as to its sense. It indicates probably some effect of his wound which incapacitated him for further combat.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Anguish</span>. This word, which occurs only in this place, comes from a root signifying to entwine or knot together. On this account Jewish commentators explain it of cramp, which often follows upon loss of blood; but it is equally possible that it means vertigo, or giddiness, when things seem to dance or interweave themselves together before the eyes. The next words signify, <span class="cmt_word">For yet is my life whole within me,</span> and give the reason why Saul asked the Amalekite to slay him. The story is at least plausible. It represents the king as deserted by his army, even to the last man, and with the Philistine cavalry and chariots in close pursuit. He is not mortally wounded, but, as giddiness prevents his escape, there is danger of his falling alive into the enemy's hand; and as they would probably not have killed him, but carried him in triumph through their cities, the way would still have been blocked against David's succession. The fear of this indignity would account for Saul's earnest appeal to the Amalekite to slay him, and, so requested, it seemed right to put him to death, instead of trying to carry him off to a place of safety. But all this was merely to keep up appearances, and in his heart he doubted not that David would regard it as a signal service that his enemy was put out of the way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he begged me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
