This persistence is a key characteristic of Absalom, who later leads a rebellion against his father, King David. The Hebrew word for "urged" implies a strong, persuasive effort, indicating Absalom's manipulative skills. This moment foreshadows Absalom's future actions and his ability to influence others, which becomes significant in the narrative of his rebellion. The cultural context of the time placed great importance on family gatherings, which Absalom uses to his advantage.<p><b>so the king sent Amnon</b><br>King David's decision to send Amnon, despite initial reluctance, highlights his vulnerability to persuasion, especially from his children. This decision sets the stage for the tragic events that follow, as Amnon's presence at the feast leads to his murder by Absalom's servants. The familial tensions and rivalries within David's household are a recurring theme in 2 Samuel, illustrating the consequences of David's earlier sins and failures as a father. The sending of Amnon also reflects the hierarchical family dynamics, where the king's word is final, yet influenced by his children's desires.<p><b>and the rest of his sons</b><br>The inclusion of all David's sons at the feast underscores the importance of family unity and celebration in ancient Israelite culture. However, it also serves as a narrative device to gather all potential heirs to the throne in one place, heightening the drama and tension of the unfolding events. This gathering foreshadows the future conflicts among David's sons, particularly the struggle for succession. The presence of all the sons also highlights the theme of brotherly conflict, reminiscent of earlier biblical stories such as Cain and Abel or Joseph and his brothers, emphasizing the recurring motif of familial discord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.

The word choice parallels occasions where persistence wins agreement&#8212;&#8220;He urged them strongly, so they turned aside&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-3.htm">Genesis 19:3</a>) and &#8220;because of his persistence he will get up&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-8.htm">Luke 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s insistence looks considerate on the surface: a son honoring his father by wanting his presence at the joyful sheep-shearing feast (cf. <a href="/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12-13</a>). In reality, it masks a calculated plan to avenge Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s hesitancy shows a father&#8217;s discernment that something felt &#8220;off,&#8221; but Absalom&#8217;s persistence overcame it. The pattern recalls how Jacob&#8217;s love for Joseph blinded him to his other sons&#8217; jealousy (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s earlier warning through Nathan&#8212;&#8220;the sword shall never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>)&#8212;is moving inexorably toward fulfillment. Absalom&#8217;s urging becomes an unseen link in that providential chain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so the king sent Amnon</b><p>&#8226; David concedes, but he does not go himself; he dispatches the crown prince Amnon instead. The king&#8217;s decision&#8212;meant to honor Absalom&#8212;unknowingly sets the stage for tragedy. <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> captures the irony: &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Amnon had raped Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-14.htm">2 Samuel 13:14</a>); the law prescribed death for such an act (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-25.htm">Deuteronomy 22:25-27</a>), yet David had not enforced justice. By sending Amnon, David unwittingly places him where Absalom can execute the vengeance David never carried out, echoing God&#8217;s pattern of turning human negligence into instruments of judgment (cf. <a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment exposes the cost of parental passivity. David&#8217;s earlier silence (<a href="/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21</a>) now culminates in a forced reckoning. <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a> sketches the progression: &#8220;after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the rest of his sons</b><p>&#8226; Absalom wanted every royal brother present to:<p>&#8211; create a public context where Amnon would feel relaxed (<a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>),<p>&#8211; ensure no one could later claim ignorance of who orchestrated the act (<a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>),<p>&#8211; deepen the humiliation of David&#8217;s household, aligning with Nathan&#8217;s prophecy: &#8220;You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-12.htm">2 Samuel 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The collective attendance intensifies the internal fracture within David&#8217;s family, foreshadowing Absalom&#8217;s broader rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>). Similar family gatherings that turn to violence&#8212;Simeon and Levi with Shechem (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-27</a>)&#8212;serve as cautionary parallels.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty operates even amid deceit. <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> does not sanitize evil but affirms that &#8220;in all things God works for the good of those who love Him,&#8221; ultimately preserving the messianic line through Solomon despite the turmoil among David&#8217;s sons (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24-25</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Absalom&#8217;s persistent urging overcame David&#8217;s reluctance, enabling a hidden agenda shaped by unresolved sin. The king&#8217;s decision to send Amnon and all the princes appears innocent yet fulfills prophetic judgment pronounced after David&#8217;s own transgression.
