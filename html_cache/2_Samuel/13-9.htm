In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hospitality and serving food were acts of kindness and duty, especially within a family. Tamar's actions reflect her role as a dutiful sister, unaware of Amnon's malicious intentions. The setting of a meal often signifies fellowship and peace, which contrasts sharply with the impending violation.<p><b>but he refused to eat</b><br>Amnon's refusal to eat is a manipulative tactic. In biblical narratives, sharing a meal often symbolizes trust and covenant (e.g., <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>, <a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>). By refusing the meal, Amnon disrupts the expected social and familial harmony, foreshadowing his betrayal. This act of refusal can be seen as a precursor to the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, who also shared a meal before his act of treachery (<a href="/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23-25</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Send everyone away!&#8221; said Amnon</b><br>Amnon's command to send everyone away is a strategic move to isolate Tamar, highlighting his premeditated intent. In the historical context, such a command from a prince would be obeyed without question, reflecting the hierarchical and patriarchal nature of the society. This isolation mirrors other biblical instances where individuals are separated for significant events, such as Joseph being alone with his brothers before being sold into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23-24</a>).<p><b>And everyone went out</b><br>The compliance of the servants underscores the authority Amnon held as the king's son. It also reflects the lack of agency and voice for women and servants in the ancient Near Eastern context. This moment of isolation is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the tragic event that follows. The absence of witnesses is a common theme in biblical narratives where wrongdoing occurs, emphasizing the vulnerability of the victim and the abuse of power by the perpetrator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The daughter of King David, known for her beauty and innocence.

(<a href="/2_samuel/13-9.htm">2 Samuel 13:9</a>a).<p>- Tamar follows Amnon&#8217;s specific request to prepare food in his sight (v. 6), showing obedient love toward a half-brother she believes is ill.<p>- Her actions echo the hospitality seen in <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6&#8211;8</a>, where food is served in good faith.<p>- The verse underscores Tamar&#8217;s purity; her motives are transparent, and nothing in her conduct invites wrongdoing (cf. <a href="/proverbs/31-15.htm">Proverbs 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he refused to eat</b><p>- Pretended sickness (v. 2) now gives way to calculated refusal, exposing Amnon&#8217;s deceit (cf. <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>).<p>- The refusal is a manipulative pivot: by not eating, he keeps Tamar near while heightening the drama so no one suspects evil.<p>- The contrast between Tamar&#8217;s sincere service and Amnon&#8217;s selfish plotting highlights the dangers of unchecked lust (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Send everyone away!</b><p>- &#8220;

yet their silent exit contributes to tragedy (cf. <a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>, where officials obey a wicked decree).<p>- The absence of accountability leaves Tamar vulnerable, fulfilling <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:10</a>: &#8220;woe to the one who is alone when he falls.&#8221;<p>- Scripture records events literally;

A man may be a good French scholar, and yet find it difficult in France to ask for things in common use. Here the Syriac is probably right in understanding, not a pan, but the delicacy Tamar had been cooking. In ver. 8 the word rendered "flour" is certainly "dough," and is so rendered in the Revised Version. The cakes were a kind of pancake, fitted to tempt the appetite of a sickly person. The picture is a very interesting one: the palace parcelled out into separate dwellings; the king kindly visiting all; the girls on friendly terms with their brothers, yet not allowed to go to their rooms without special permission; and finally Tamar's skill in cookery - an accomplishment by no means despised in an Oriental <span class="accented">menage</span>, or thought unworthy of a king's daughter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then she brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
