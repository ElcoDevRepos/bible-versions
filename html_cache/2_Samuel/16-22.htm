The roof of the palace was a significant location, as it was the same place where David had first seen Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>). The act of pitching a tent on the roof symbolizes a bold and defiant move by Absalom, asserting his claim to the throne. In ancient Near Eastern culture, taking over a king's harem was a declaration of kingship and power. This act was advised by Ahithophel, David's former counselor, as a way to strengthen Absalom's claim and to show a complete break with his father (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>).<p><b>and he slept with his father&#8217;s concubines</b><br>This action fulfilled Nathan's prophecy to David after his sin with Bathsheba, where God declared that He would raise up evil against David from his own house and that his wives would be given to his neighbor (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11-12</a>). The act of sleeping with the king's concubines was a grave sin and a public humiliation for David. It was a cultural practice in the ancient world for a successor to assert dominance by taking over the previous king's harem, thus symbolizing the transfer of power and authority.<p><b>in the sight of all Israel</b><br>The public nature of this act was intended to solidify Absalom's position as king in the eyes of the people. It was a demonstration of his power and a statement that he had taken over his father's position. This act was not done in secret but was meant to be a public spectacle, further alienating David and rallying support for Absalom. The phrase underscores the shame and dishonor brought upon David, fulfilling the consequences of his earlier sins. This event also highlights the theme of public versus private sin and the repercussions that follow, a recurring theme in the narrative of David's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.
