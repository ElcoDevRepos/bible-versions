David had sent his servants to express condolences for Hanun's father, Nahash, who had shown kindness to David. This act of taking David's servants was a breach of diplomatic protocol and an insult to David's intentions. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, and their relationship with Israel was historically contentious, as seen in <a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4-33</a>.<p><b>shaved off half of each man&#8217;s beard</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, a man's beard was a symbol of dignity and honor. Shaving off half of the beard was a severe humiliation, akin to a public shaming. This act was not only a personal affront to the men but also an insult to David, their king. The beard held religious significance as well, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>, where Israelites were instructed on how to treat their beards.<p><b>cut off their garments at the hips</b><br>Cutting off the garments at the hips left the men exposed and humiliated. Clothing in biblical times was a sign of status and identity, and to be stripped of it was to be stripped of one's dignity. This act of humiliation was intended to disgrace David's men and, by extension, David himself. It reflects the cultural practices of shaming enemies, similar to the treatment of captives in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>.<p><b>and sent them away</b><br>Sending the men away in such a state was a deliberate act of public humiliation. It was intended to send a message to David and the Israelites that they were not respected by the Ammonites. This action set the stage for the ensuing conflict between Israel and the Ammonites, as recorded in the following verses. The sending away of the humiliated servants can be seen as a type of rejection, paralleling the rejection of Christ by His own people, as noted in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanun.htm">Hanun</a></b><br>The new king of the Ammonites, who succeeded his father Nahash.

"Cutting off a person's beard is regarded by the Arabs as an indignity quite equal to flogging and branding among ourselves.

Moreover, as only the priests wore underclothing, and as the ordinary dress of men consisted of a tunic and a loose flowing robe thrown over it, the cutting of this robe short up to the hip was a vile and abominable affront. Of course, Hanun intended this as a challenge to war, whereas David had meant peace and friendship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Hanun</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;n&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2586.htm">Strong's 2586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hanun -- 'favored', two contemporaries of Nehemiah, also an Ammonite king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
