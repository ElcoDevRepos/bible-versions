They were places of separation and judgment, symbolically representing a place where God&#8217;s presence could be discerned. The mention of Nacon, though not much is known about this specific location, indicates a specific point in the journey where a critical event occurs. Threshing floors are also seen in other biblical narratives, such as Ruth meeting Boaz, and David purchasing the threshing floor of Araunah, which later became the site of the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>).<p><b>Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, representing God's presence and covenant with His people. It was to be handled with utmost reverence, as prescribed in the Law (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Uzzah's action, though seemingly instinctive, violated the divine command that only the Levites, specifically the Kohathites, were to carry the ark, and even they were not to touch it directly. This act underscores the holiness of God and the seriousness of His commandments.<p><b>because the oxen had stumbled</b><br>The ark was being transported on a cart, which was contrary to the instructions given in the Law, where it was to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites using poles (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>). The use of a cart, similar to how the Philistines transported it (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-8</a>), reflects a departure from divine instructions. The stumbling of the oxen serves as a reminder of the consequences of not adhering to God's prescribed methods, highlighting the importance of obedience and reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A Levite who was responsible for the care of the Ark of the Covenant during its transport.

Such places often become stages for decisive moments (<a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15</a>).<p>&#8211; A threshing floor pictures separation of wheat from chaff, echoing God&#8217;s concern for purity (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). The setting quietly signals that what follows will test motives and obedience.<p>&#8211; David&#8217;s company is celebrating (<a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>), yet location matters: joy must still be governed by reverence (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God</b><p>&#8211; The ark was never to be touched. God had ordered it carried on poles by Levites (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). By placing it on a cart and letting non-Levites escort it, Israel had already sidestepped clear commands (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8211; Uzzah&#8217;s gesture looked protective, even instinctive, but it violated holiness. The ark represented God&#8217;s throne among His people (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), and no human hand could presume familiarity.<p>&#8211; Similar irreverence had cost lives before (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). Scripture shows that good intentions cannot cancel direct commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the oxen had stumbled</b><p>&#8211; The immediate trigger is an animal&#8217;s misstep, yet the deeper issue is human neglect of divine instruction. Oxen were never meant to bear the ark; poles on shoulders would not have lurched (<a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Uzzah&#8217;s reflex reveals a mindset that assumes human responsibility for guarding God, rather than trusting God to guard Himself and His covenant symbols (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>).<p>&#8211; The incident exposes the danger of relying on pragmatic solutions&#8212;&#8220;new cart&#8221; efficiency&#8212;over revealed truth (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). David later admits, &#8220;We did not inquire of Him about the proper order&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse captures a collision between human enthusiasm and divine holiness. At a threshing floor&#8212;fittingly, a place of sifting&#8212;Uzzah&#8217;s well-meaning but disobedient touch of the ark brings judgment because God&#8217;s explicit instructions had been ignored. The stumble of the oxen merely exposes underlying compromise: transporting holy things in a man-made manner. <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a> therefore warns that reverence and obedience must frame all worship; sincerity can never substitute for submission to God&#8217;s clear word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Nachon's threshingfloor.</span>--This place is entirely unknown. <a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm" title="And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.">1Chronicles 13:9</a> has "the threshingfloor of Chidon; "but it may be doubted whether the word is a proper name at all.

The turning aside of the oxen to snatch the scattered grain of the threshingfioor may have caused the trouble.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nachon's threshing floor.</span> In the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9</a>) we find "the threshing floor of Chidon," and "Chidon" is proved to have been a proper name by the feebleness of the attempts made to find for it a meaning. We therefore gather that "Nachou" is also a proper name, but otherwise we should certainly have translated it "a fixed threshing floor." The people did indeed thresh or trample out their corn often on summer threshing floors (<a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>), that is, on fitting spots in the fields themselves. But as a large quantity of earth was sure in this cash to be mixed with the corn, they preferred to use places with solid floors or pavements, which lasted for many generations, and often became well-known spots (<a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>). Even if "Nachon" be a proper name, this would be a permanent floor, paved with stones, the approaches to which would be worn and made rough by the tracks of the carts bringing the corn. <span class="cmt_word">Here the oxen shook it;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">stumbled</span>, and so the Revised Version. Nothing is said of the ark being in danger. Uzzah's act was one of precaution. The ground was rough, the oxen stumbled, and he put forth his hand to hold the ark till the cart had reached level ground. If the threshing floor was formed in the natural rock, those who have been in Spain, and seen how the tracks in the Pyrenees are worn by the native carts into deep ruts in the solid stone, can well understand that the neighbourhood of this much-frequented spot would need very careful driving. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
