The "king" mentioned here is likely the Ammonite king, possibly Hanun, who had previously humiliated David's envoys (<a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-4</a>). The act of taking the crown symbolizes the transfer of power and authority from the defeated king to David. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the crown was a symbol of sovereignty and divine favor. This act signifies God's judgment against the Ammonites and His favor upon David, fulfilling the promise of victory over Israel's enemies.<p><b>It weighed a talent of gold and was set with precious stones,</b><br>A talent of gold is an enormous weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, indicating the immense wealth and splendor of the Ammonite kingdom. The inclusion of precious stones suggests the crown's value and the opulence of the Ammonite rulers. This detail highlights the material wealth that David acquired through his military campaigns, which was often seen as a sign of God's blessing. The use of gold and precious stones in royal regalia is consistent with other biblical descriptions of wealth and splendor, such as the construction of the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>).<p><b>and it was placed on David&#8217;s head.</b><br>Placing the crown on David's head symbolizes his victory and the consolidation of his rule over the conquered territory. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). Just as David was a king who expanded his kingdom through conquest, Jesus is portrayed as the King who will establish His eternal kingdom. The imagery of a crown is also significant in the New Testament, where believers are promised crowns as rewards for faithfulness (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>).<p><b>And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.</b><br>The plunder taken from Rabbah represents the spoils of war, which were common in ancient military campaigns. This wealth would have been used to support David's kingdom and possibly for the future construction of the Temple, which Solomon, David's son, would build. The taking of plunder is consistent with God's promises to Israel regarding the conquest of their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the material blessings that can accompany obedience to God's commands, although David's life also illustrates the spiritual and moral challenges that come with such success.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is central to this passage.

But there were various other Eastern talents, as the Babylonian and Persian, of much smaller weight, and it is not unlikely that a light talent may have been in use among the Ammonites. The weight, however, on any reasonable supposition, would have been too great to allow of this crown being commonly worn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Malcam.</span> This is another mode of spelling Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, and is found also in <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably in <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>.

Grammatically, <span class="accented">Malcam</span> also means "their king," and even so belongs to Milcom. For the crown weighed a hundred pounds, a ponderous mass, which no man could possibly bear, and, least of all, when making, as was the case with the Ammonite king, his last stand for his life. But after the capture of the city, it was lifted from the head of the idol, and placed formally upon David's head, and held there for a few moments, as a sign of victory and of rejoicing over the fall of the false god. There is no reason for supposing that there is any exaggeration in the weight, nor will the Hebrew allow us to understand the talent of gold as referring to its value. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
