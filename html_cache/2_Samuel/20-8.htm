It was known for its large stone structures, which were likely used for various communal and religious purposes. The "great stone" could have been a landmark or a place of gathering. Gibeon was also the site of a notable battle between the forces of David and those of Saul's son, Ish-bosheth, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2</a>. This location is historically significant as it was a Levitical city and a place where the Gibeonites, who had made a treaty with Israel during Joshua's conquest, resided.<p><b>Amasa joined them</b><br>Amasa was appointed by Absalom as the commander of his army during the rebellion against David. After Absalom's defeat, David, in an attempt to unify the kingdom and replace Joab, appointed Amasa as the commander of his army. This move was politically motivated to win the loyalty of those who had supported Absalom. Amasa's joining them at Gibeon indicates his role in the ongoing military and political maneuvers following Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>Now Joab was dressed in military attire</b><br>Joab, David's nephew and long-time commander of his army, was a seasoned warrior known for his military prowess and political acumen. His military attire signifies his readiness for battle and his authoritative position. Joab's clothing would have been typical of a high-ranking officer, possibly including armor and insignia denoting his status.<p><b>with a dagger strapped to his belt</b><br>The dagger was a common weapon for close combat, often carried by soldiers and officers. It symbolizes both readiness for battle and potential treachery, as it was easily accessible for a surprise attack. In the context of Joab, who had a history of decisive and sometimes ruthless actions, the dagger foreshadows the violent act he is about to commit.<p><b>And as he stepped forward, he slipped the dagger from its sheath</b><br>This action is deliberate and premeditated, indicating Joab's intention to use the dagger. The act of slipping the dagger from its sheath suggests stealth and surprise, characteristic of an assassin rather than a soldier in open combat. Joab's actions here are consistent with his previous behavior, such as his killing of Abner in <a href="/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>, which was also marked by betrayal and personal vendetta. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to the murder of Amasa, further complicating the political landscape of David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amasa.htm">Amasa</a></b><br>Appointed by King David as the commander of the army in place of Joab.

And Joab's garment, etc.; more correctly, <span class="accented">and Joab was girded with his military coat as his garment, and over it was the strap of his sword in its sheath, and it</span> (masculine, equivalent to "the sheath") <span class="accented">came out, and it</span> (feminine, equivalent to "the sword") <span class="accented">fell.</span> This change of gender is very harsh, and has caused the Authorized Version to apply the masculine verb to Joab, and translate, and as he went forth it fell; but a very slight change, supported by the Septuagint, gives us a more satisfactory sense, namely, <span class="accented">and it</span> (<span class="accented">the sword</span>) <span class="accented">came out and fell.</span> It is generally assumed that all this was arranged beforehand on Joab's part, who had so placed his sword that he could shake it out of the sheath. More probably it was an accident, of which he took instant advantage. He had felt that his position was insecure, and that if David had the support of Amasa, and a powerful band of the men of Judah at Jerusalem, he would probably order his execution for slaying Absalom; and Amasa would carry out the command willingly enough, as he thereby would secure the high position offered him. We know David's feelings towards Joab from his dying command to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a>), and probably he had given various indications of his deep seated resentment. Joab, therefore, determined to stop Amasa's growth in power, and also to give David a rough lesson. And this accident gave him an early opportunity, which he used with ruthless energy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[And while] they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
