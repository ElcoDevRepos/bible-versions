It was a fertile area, often associated with the tribes of Gad and Manasseh. The journey to Gilead signifies a thorough census, as this area was significant for its strategic location and resources. Historically, Gilead was a contested region due to its valuable land and resources.<p><b>and the land of Tahtim-hodshi</b><br>Tahtim-hodshi is a location mentioned only in this passage, and its exact identification remains uncertain. The name may suggest a "new land" or "lower land," indicating a region that was perhaps newly settled or less known. This reflects the comprehensive nature of the census, reaching even obscure or newly established areas.<p><b>and on to Dan-jaan</b><br>Dan-jaan is likely a reference to the northernmost city of Dan, which was originally called Laish before the tribe of Dan conquered it (<a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>). This city marked the northern boundary of Israel, often used in the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" to denote the entire land of Israel. The inclusion of Dan-jaan in the census highlights the extent of David's kingdom and the thoroughness of the survey.<p><b>and around to Sidon</b><br>Sidon was a prominent Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast, north of Israel. Although not part of Israel, its mention indicates the proximity of the census to Israel's northern neighbors. Sidon was known for its trade and craftsmanship, and its inclusion in the narrative may underscore the influence and reach of David's kingdom. The reference to Sidon also connects to the broader biblical narrative, as Sidon is frequently mentioned in the context of Israel's interactions with surrounding nations (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain.

Its very obscurity teaches two things:<p>&#8226; The count was exhaustive; even places unknown to later readers were visited, echoing the thorough possession of the land in <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1&#8211;10</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s knowledge of His people is equally exhaustive (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;3</a>). Joab might miss no village, but the LORD misses no heart motive&#8212;hence His displeasure with David&#8217;s pride in ordering the census (<a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and on to Dan-jaan</b><p>Next they moved &#8220;on to Dan-jaan&#8221;, a site near Israel&#8217;s northern border. The tribe of Dan had migrated here centuries before (<a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>), and later writers used &#8220;from Dan to Beersheba&#8221; to describe the whole span of the nation (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; By reaching Dan-jaan the census literally touches the top of Israel, highlighting how far David&#8217;s kingdom had expanded under God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the episode warns that wide borders do not equal spiritual security; Dan would later host one of Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>), showing how quickly self-reliance can lead to idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and around to Sidon</b><p>Finally the team went &#8220;around to Sidon&#8221;. Sidon lay on the Mediterranean coast in Phoenician territory, outside Israel&#8217;s formal allotment (<a href="/joshua/13-4.htm">Joshua 13:4&#8211;6</a>), but within David&#8217;s sphere of influence (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Including Sidon in the route underlines that foreign trade partners and buffer zones also came under David&#8217;s review.<p>&#8226; It reveals how temptation grows with success: as Israel brushed shoulders with wealthy Sidon, the lure of worldly strength intensified (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;5</a>, where Sidonian ties later drew Solomon astray).<p>&#8226; The sweep from Gilead to Sidon pictures a kingdom blessed on every side (<a href="/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12&#8211;15</a>), yet David&#8217;s numbering act shows that blessings become snares when gratitude slides into pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6</a> traces Joab&#8217;s census team from Gilead, through the little-known Tahtim-hodshi, up to Dan-jaan, and out toward Sidon. The route proves the vastness of David&#8217;s realm and the meticulous nature of the count, but it also exposes the danger of depending on numbers and territory rather than on the LORD. Just as Joab walked every mile, God sees every motive; therefore true security lies not in the breadth of our influence but in humble reliance on Him who grants it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Land of Tahtim-hodshi.--</span>This unknown and strange name, of which the ancient versions make nothing, is generally considered as a corruption. The most probable conjecture is that for "Tahtim" we should read "Hittites"&#255;(a change of only a single letter), and that "Hodshi" is the remnant of an expression designating the month of their arrival there.<p><span class= "bld">Dan-jaan.</span>--This is the only place in which the name "Dan" occurs with this addition. It seems certain that the same Dan must be meant as in <a href="/2_samuel/24-2.htm" title="For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the number of the people.">2Samuel 24:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm" title="So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.">2Samuel 24:15</a>; and so the reading of the LXX. (Alex.) and Vulg. may be correct: "Dan-jaar=Dan in the forest."<p><span class= "bld">Zidon.</span>--This mother city of the Ph?nicians was in the tribe of Asher nominally, but was never actually possessed by the Israelites. The same also is true of Tyre. Either the census-takers merely came to the confines of these cities, or, being on friendly terms, actually entered them to enumerate the Israelites living in them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they came to Gilead.</span> When the enumerators had finished their labours in Reuben and the region south of Aroer, Joab moved his camp northwards, and pitched in Gilead, on the river Jabbek; and, having completed the counting in this part of the tribe of Gad, would next enter the wild regions of Manasseh. It is probable that the tribal princes and local officers actually numbered the people, and that Joab, with a powerful force, constrained them to obedience often against their will. It was possibly this danger of resistance which made David entrust the business to Joab, instead of employing the Levites. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Tahtim-hodshi</span>. Gesenius dismisses this name with the remark that it can scarcely be regarded as genuine. The versions give little help; but Thenius cleverly extracts from the LXX., "unto Bashan, which is Edrei." Others, by a slight change in the Hebrew, read, "the land of the Hittites," and suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the Hebrew word for "month," so that the whole might have been, "They came to the land of the Hittites in the (third) month." Others, again, suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the name of the town Kadesh. But the versions would certainly have preserved anything so commonplace as this. When they make mistakes, it is almost invariably in proper names or unusual phrases. The emendation of Thenius is too ingenious to be accepted, but it gives the right sense, namely, that from Gilead and the tribe of Gad the numerators went northward through Bashan and the rest of the half tribe of Manasseh till they came to Dan, the town on the extreme northeast border, and the limit in that direction of the Israelite realm, as Beersheba was its limit on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Dan-jaan.</span> Nowhere else is Dan found with this addition, and the Syriac omits it even here. The Vulgate, and Septuagint (Codex Alex.) read <span class="accented">Dan-jaar</span> the woodland Dan. Possibly the names of two towns have been run into one, and the original reading was "unto Dan and Ijon" (see <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>). Ijon was on the direct road from Dan to Sidon. <span class="cmt_word">Zidon</span>. This was on the extreme northwestern boundary. It did not actually belong to David, but both it and Tyro had apparently placed themselves under his protection, and were bound to render some kind of military service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
