Women in biblical narratives often play crucial roles in God's plans, as seen with figures like Rahab and Jael. The use of a covering suggests a common household item, indicating the woman's ability to use available resources to protect David's messengers.<p><b>spread it over the mouth of the well</b><br>Wells were vital in ancient Israel for water supply and often served as community gathering places. Covering the well's mouth was a strategic move to conceal the messengers hiding inside. This action reflects the cultural importance of hospitality and protection of guests, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>and scattered grain over it</b><br>Scattering grain was a clever tactic to disguise the well's true purpose. Grain was a staple in the diet of ancient Israelites, and its presence would not arouse suspicion. This act of deception parallels other biblical instances where God&#8217;s people use cunning to achieve His purposes, such as when David feigned madness before Achish.<p><b>so nobody would know a thing</b><br>This phrase underscores the secrecy and urgency of the situation. The need for discretion was paramount to protect the lives of David's allies and ensure the success of his mission. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s providence and protection over His chosen leaders, as seen in the preservation of Moses and the hiding of the spies in Jericho.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>An unnamed woman who plays a crucial role in protecting David's messengers.
