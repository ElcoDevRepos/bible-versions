Asahel, known for his swiftness, is pursuing him. This pursuit occurs during the civil conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David. Abner's warning indicates a desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, especially against a fellow Israelite. The repetition of the warning suggests Abner's reluctance to harm Asahel, highlighting the tension between personal relationships and political allegiances.<p><b>Stop chasing me.</b><br>Abner's plea for Asahel to cease his pursuit reflects the gravity of the situation. In ancient warfare, personal combat was often a matter of honor and skill. Abner's request underscores his awareness of the potential consequences of their encounter. This moment illustrates the tragic nature of civil strife, where kinship and loyalty are at odds.<p><b>Why should I strike you to the ground?</b><br>Abner's rhetorical question reveals his internal conflict. Striking Asahel, a valiant warrior and brother to Joab, would escalate the conflict and deepen the rift between the factions. This phrase highlights the moral and ethical considerations in warfare, where the value of life and the implications of one's actions are weighed.<p><b>How could I show my face to your brother Joab?</b><br>Joab, a formidable military leader and Asahel's brother, would seek retribution for Asahel's death. Abner's concern about facing Joab indicates the personal vendettas that can arise from such conflicts. This phrase foreshadows the cycle of vengeance that characterizes much of the narrative in 2 Samuel. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the need for reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, a key military leader in Israel, and a central figure in the power struggle following Saul's death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asahel.htm">Asahel</a></b><br>The brother of Joab, known for his swiftness and determination.
