Joab, a military commander and nephew of David, is known for his strategic mind and political acumen. The king referred to here is King David, who ruled over Israel and Judah. The cultural context of approaching a king required careful planning and often involved intermediaries, as direct access to the king was limited. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where kings were seen as divinely appointed leaders. The use of intermediaries is also seen in other biblical narratives, such as Nathan confronting David through a parable (2 Samuel 12).<p><b>And Joab put the words in her mouth.</b><br>Joab's involvement in orchestrating the woman's speech highlights his influence and the lengths he would go to achieve his objectives. The phrase indicates that the woman, a wise woman from Tekoa, was not speaking on her own behalf but was delivering a message crafted by Joab. This reflects the practice of using parables or stories to convey deeper truths, a method also employed by prophets and teachers in the Bible. The act of putting words in someone's mouth can be seen as a type of divine inspiration, where God uses individuals to deliver His message, similar to how prophets spoke on behalf of God. This narrative foreshadows the reconciliation theme found in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ acts as the mediator between God and humanity, bringing about reconciliation through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army and a key political figure in David's court.

Here, however, it is a human commander guiding the speech, revealing both Joab&#8217;s initiative and his manipulation.<p>&#8226; Scripture faithfully records, without endorsing, the imperfections of its characters. Joab&#8217;s plan is driven by political calculation, yet God will still use it to move David toward reconciliation with Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Other examples of people being coached to speak include Rebekah instructing Jacob to secure Isaac&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5&#8211;10</a>) and Baruch writing Jeremiah&#8217;s dictated prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>).
