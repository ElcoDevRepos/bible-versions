The context is the rebellion of Absalom against his father, King David. The men mentioned are likely Absalom's spies or soldiers tasked with capturing David's messengers. This highlights the tension and danger present during Absalom's coup.<p><b>Ahimaaz and Jonathan</b><br>Ahimaaz and Jonathan were the sons of the priests Zadok and Abiathar, respectively. They served as loyal messengers for King David during Absalom's rebellion. Their role underscores the importance of communication and loyalty in times of political upheaval. Their actions also reflect the faithfulness of the priestly families to David, despite the national crisis.<p><b>climbed up out of the well</b><br>The well served as a hiding place for Ahimaaz and Jonathan, illustrating the resourcefulness and urgency of their mission. Wells were common in ancient Israel and often used for water storage, but in this instance, it provided a temporary refuge. This act of concealment is reminiscent of other biblical stories where God's people are hidden for protection, such as Rahab hiding the spies in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<p><b>and went to inform King David</b><br>Their mission was to deliver crucial intelligence to David, emphasizing the importance of timely and accurate information in warfare. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine providence and guidance, as God often uses individuals to fulfill His purposes and protect His anointed.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Get up and cross over the river at once</b><br>The urgency in their message highlights the imminent danger David faced. The river mentioned is the Jordan River, a significant geographical and symbolic boundary in Israel's history.

His counsel was highly regarded, and his betrayal added a layer of complexity to the rebellion. This phrase underscores the threat posed by Ahithophel's wisdom now turned against David.
