The celebration was a national event, reflecting the collective joy and reverence for the LORD. The context is the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant religious and political event. The Ark symbolized God's presence, and its return marked a spiritual renewal for Israel. This celebration can be compared to other communal worship events in the Bible, such as the dedication of Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 8) and the Passover celebrations (Exodus 12).<p><b>with all kinds of wood instruments</b><br>The use of wood instruments indicates the variety and richness of the musical worship. Instruments made from wood were common in ancient Israel, and their inclusion in worship signifies the use of available resources to honor God. This phrase suggests a diversity of sounds and a full orchestration, reflecting the creativity and skill of the musicians. The use of instruments in worship is seen throughout the Psalms, where music is a central element of praise (Psalm 150).<p><b>harps</b><br>Harps were stringed instruments often associated with joy and worship. David himself was known for playing the harp, which he used to soothe King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>). The harp's inclusion in this celebration connects to David's personal history and his role as a musician and worship leader. Harps are frequently mentioned in the Psalms, underscoring their importance in Israelite worship (<a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>).<p><b>stringed instruments</b><br>This phrase encompasses a variety of instruments, including lyres and lutes, which were common in ancient Near Eastern music. Stringed instruments were versatile and could produce a range of sounds, from joyful to mournful. Their use in worship highlights the emotional depth and expressiveness of Israel's musical tradition. The inclusion of stringed instruments in worship is echoed in the Psalms, where they are often called upon to praise God (<a href="/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>).<p><b>tambourines</b><br>Tambourines were percussion instruments associated with dance and celebration. They were often played by women, as seen in the victory song of Miriam after the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>). The tambourine's rhythmic sound added energy and movement to the worship, symbolizing joy and triumph. Its use in this context reflects the celebratory nature of the event and the spontaneous expression of worship.<p><b>sistrums</b><br>Sistrums were ancient percussion instruments, similar to rattles, used in religious ceremonies. Although more commonly associated with Egyptian worship, their presence here indicates cultural exchange and the adoption of diverse musical elements in Israelite worship. The sistrum's distinctive sound would have added a unique texture to the music, enhancing the celebratory atmosphere.<p><b>and cymbals</b><br>Cymbals were loud, clashing instruments used to mark significant moments in worship. Their sound was attention-grabbing, symbolizing the grandeur and majesty of God. Cymbals are mentioned in several Psalms as instruments of praise (<a href="/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>), and their use here underscores the intensity and exuberance of the celebration. The inclusion of cymbals highlights the importance of worship as a multisensory experience, engaging both the participants and the divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, leading the celebration as the Ark of the Covenant is being transported.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel who are participating in the celebration, signifying national unity and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest symbolizing God's presence and covenant with Israel, being moved to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/musical_instruments.htm">Musical Instruments</a></b><br>Various instruments used in worship, indicating the joy and reverence of the occasion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_before_the_lord.htm">Celebration Before the LORD</a></b><br>A communal act of worship and joy, expressing reverence and gratitude to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_worship.htm">The Joy of Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be a joyful expression of our love and reverence for God, as demonstrated by David and the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The entire house of Israel participated, showing the importance of communal worship and unity in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_music_in_worship.htm">The Role of Music in Worship</a></b><br>Music is a powerful tool for expressing worship and can be used to glorify God in diverse ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The Ark symbolized God's presence, reminding us to approach worship with reverence and awe.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_in_god's_presence.htm">Celebration in God's Presence</a></b><br>Worship is not just a duty but a celebration of God's goodness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_6_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 6:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_6_5_s_impact_on_worship_today.htm">How does 2 Samuel 6:5 inspire our worship practices today?

The difference between the two is very slight in the Hebrew, and it is generally thought that the latter is the correct reading. The variation, however, mast have been ancient, since the LXX. combines the two. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Played</span>.

More sensibly Thenius regards it as the right reading, and the words here as a corruption of it, caused by some scribe misspelling the words, which are nearly identical. In our version the ambiguous meaning of the word "played" makes the passage less startling. For "they danced with all cypress woods" is unintelligible. The musical instruments mentioned here are the harp, Hebrew <span class="accented">chinnor</span>, a guitar; the psaltery, Hebrew <span class="accented">nebel</span>, a kind of <span class="cmt_word">harp</span> of a triangular shape, with the point downwards; the <span class="cmt_word">timbrel</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">tof</span>, a tambourine or small drum; the <span class="cmt_word">cornet</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">mena'na'</span>, a bar on which were a number of loose metal rings, which were shaken in time to the music, but others think that "castanets" are meant, which are pieces of wood beaten in time. The Revised Version adopts this rendering. And finally <span class="cmt_word">cymbals</span>. For "cornets" we find in the parallel place "trumpets," whence the translators of the Authorized Version took their rendering; but the Hebrew word means "things to shake." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1491;
