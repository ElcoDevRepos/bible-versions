This familial connection places Abishai in a prominent position within David's military hierarchy. Joab, his brother, was the commander of David's army, indicating a family deeply involved in the military leadership of Israel. Zeruiah's sons were known for their fierce loyalty and military prowess, which played a significant role in David's reign. The mention of Zeruiah highlights the matriarchal lineage, which is somewhat unusual in the patriarchal context of the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of this family in David's story.<p><b>was chief of the Three</b><br>Abishai's position as chief of the Three indicates his high rank among David's mighty men, a group of elite warriors who performed extraordinary feats. The "Three" refers to a select group of warriors who were renowned for their bravery and skill in battle. This title suggests that Abishai was not only a formidable warrior but also a leader among the elite, entrusted with significant responsibilities and honor. His leadership role underscores the trust and respect he earned from David and his peers.<p><b>and he wielded his spear against three hundred men</b><br>This phrase highlights Abishai's exceptional combat skills and bravery. The act of wielding his spear against three hundred men is a testament to his strength and courage, characteristics highly valued in the ancient Near Eastern warrior culture. Such feats were often celebrated in the annals of history to inspire and instill pride among the people. This act of valor is reminiscent of other biblical figures who performed great deeds, such as Samson and his exploits against the Philistines.<p><b>killed them</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the outcome of Abishai's battle, showcasing his effectiveness and prowess as a warrior. In the context of ancient warfare, such victories were crucial for the survival and expansion of a nation. Abishai's success in battle would have contributed to the security and stability of David's kingdom, reinforcing his reputation as a mighty warrior. This act also reflects the divine favor often associated with David's warriors, as their victories were seen as part of God's plan for Israel.<p><b>and won a name along with the Three</b><br>Winning a name signifies gaining fame and honor, a common theme in the narratives of David's mighty men. Abishai's inclusion among the Three indicates that his deeds were not only recognized but celebrated, ensuring his legacy within the biblical narrative. This acknowledgment aligns with the biblical theme of God exalting those who are faithful and courageous. Abishai's reputation would have served as an inspiration for future generations, illustrating the rewards of loyalty and bravery in service to God's chosen king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a></b><br>The brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, Abishai was a prominent warrior in King David's army.

Abishai, by reason of this exploit, became "chief of the three;" that is, of the second order of three established in the fraternity of the mighties. At the end of the verse, and in ver. 19, the Authorized Version strangely puts the article where it is absent in the Hebrew, and omits it where it is present. The right rendering and meaning is, "He had a name, that is, rank, reputation, among the three. Was he not the most honourable of the three?
