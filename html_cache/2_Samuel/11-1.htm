The rainy season had ended, making travel and warfare more feasible. This was a common practice among ancient kingdoms, as seen in other biblical accounts (<a href="/1_kings/20-22.htm">1 Kings 20:22, 26</a>). The timing underscores the expectation that kings would lead their armies, highlighting the unusual nature of David's decision to stay behind.<p><b>David sent out Joab and his servants with the whole army of Israel</b><br>David, the king of Israel, delegates the military leadership to Joab, his trusted commander. Joab is a prominent figure in David's reign, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless tactics (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27, 20</a>:10). The mention of "the whole army of Israel" indicates a significant military campaign, emphasizing the seriousness of the conflict with the Ammonites.<p><b>They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah</b><br>The Ammonites were a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4-33</a>). The destruction of the Ammonites signifies a decisive victory for Israel. Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, is located in modern-day Amman, Jordan. Archaeological evidence supports its significance as a fortified city. The siege of Rabbah indicates a prolonged military engagement, which is further detailed in <a href="/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-31</a>.<p><b>but David remained in Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase is pivotal, marking a departure from the expected role of a king. David's decision to stay in Jerusalem sets the stage for the events that follow, including his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2-5</a>). This deviation from duty can be seen as a moral and spiritual lapse, leading to personal and national consequences. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the human propensity to sin and the need for divine grace, foreshadowing the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the perfect king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who chose to stay in Jerusalem instead of leading his army into battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, tasked with leading the military campaign against the Ammonites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_david.htm">Servants of David</a></b><br>The soldiers and officials who accompanied Joab to battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation under David's rule, engaged in warfare against the Ammonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>The enemy nation that Israel was fighting against during this campaign.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabbah.htm">Rabbah</a></b><br>The capital city of the Ammonites, which was besieged by Joab and the Israelite army.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David remained, setting the stage for the events that follow in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_duty.htm">The Importance of Duty</a></b><br>David's decision to remain in Jerusalem instead of leading his troops serves as a cautionary tale about neglecting one's responsibilities.

But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.">1Chronicles 20:1</a>, explains "wasted the country of the children." After the custom of ancient warfare, while the army was besieging Rabbah, foraging parties were sent out to lay waste the country and cut off any stragglers. Comp. <a href="/context/1_samuel/13-17.htm" title="And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:">1Samuel 13:17-18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the year was expired;</span> Hebrew and Revised Version, <span class="accented">at the return of the year</span>; that is, as Josephus paraphrases it, "the next spring." It seems quite certain that the war with Hadarezer did not take place in the same year as the defeat of the Syrians at Medeba. For the gathering of his mercenaries by Nahash would occupy a long time, and it was done so leisurely, that not only did news of it reach Jerusalem, but David was able to collect his forces, and instead of awaiting the invasion, could deliver his attack on the enemy's ground. The battle at Medeba took place in the autumn, and, as it was impossible to keep the field with winter so near, Joab marched back to Jerusalem, intending in the spring to return to the siege of Rabbah. But David quickly had information that a more serious war was impending, and, instead of sending Joab, he now gathers "all Israel," and, after gaining a victory, it is plain that he marched into the Syrian territories, and compelled by his presence the allies of Hadarezer to transfer their allegiance to him. Simultaneously with this war he had to meet the attack of the Edomites, for which purpose he detached Abishai with a portion of his army; and it was necessary also to post garrisons in their country, and in Atom of Damascus. It was while he was thus occupied in the Aramean states that he gathered the "much brass" spoken of in <a href="/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>. The Ammonites would necessarily be left to themselves while these great events were going on, but now, after a respite of a year and a half, David <span class="cmt_word">sent Joab, and his servants,</span> that is, his officers - the word "servant" in Oriental courts being constantly used to designate those, high in rank near the king's person - <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel;</span> that is, an army gathered from all the tribes. In accordance with the cruel customs of ancient warfare, they began by laying the whole country waste, and putting all whom they found to the sword, and thus <span class="cmt_word">destroyed the children of Ammon</span> before laying siege to the capital, into which all the people by these harsh measures had been forced to go for refuge. In the Hebrew there is a curious spelling, the word "kings" being written <span class="accented">melakim</span>, with an <span class="accented">aleph</span> to represent the long a. It is a mistake to suppose that a different word, <span class="accented">malakim</span>, "angels" or "ambassadors," is meant, as it is nothing more than an archaic method of spelling, instances of which have been made rare by the extreme fastidiousness of Hebrew scribes. There is, however, another example not far off, where the Hebrew word for "poor" is also written with an inserted <span class="accented">aleph.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the spring,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7791;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
