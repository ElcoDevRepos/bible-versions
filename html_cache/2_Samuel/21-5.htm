The context is a dialogue between David and the Gibeonites, a group that had been wronged by Saul. The king here is David, who is known for his heart after God and his desire to uphold justice and righteousness in Israel. This interaction highlights the importance of seeking reconciliation and justice, even for past wrongs.<p><b>As for the man who consumed us</b><br>The "man" referred to is King Saul, who had previously attempted to annihilate the Gibeonites. This phrase underscores Saul's aggressive actions against them, which were in violation of a covenant made during the time of Joshua (Joshua 9). The term "consumed" suggests a complete and utter destruction, reflecting the severity of Saul's actions. This highlights the biblical principle of the sanctity of covenants and the consequences of breaking them.<p><b>and plotted against us</b><br>This indicates premeditated actions by Saul against the Gibeonites. The use of "plotted" suggests intentional and strategic planning to harm them. This reflects Saul's disregard for the covenant and his prioritization of nationalistic zeal over divine commands. It serves as a reminder of the dangers of allowing personal or political motives to override God's laws.<p><b>to exterminate us from existing</b><br>The phrase "to exterminate us" emphasizes the genocidal intent behind Saul's actions. This reflects the historical context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where complete destruction of enemies was often sought. It also highlights the severity of Saul's sin, as it was not just an attack but an attempt to completely erase the Gibeonites' presence and identity.<p><b>within any border of Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates the geographical scope of Saul's intended destruction, aiming to remove the Gibeonites from all of Israel. It underscores the idea of territorial purity that Saul might have been pursuing, which was contrary to God's inclusive covenant with the Gibeonites. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's concern for justice and protection of the marginalized, as seen in various laws and narratives throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people who were not Israelites but had a treaty with Israel.
