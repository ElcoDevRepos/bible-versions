It reflects the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his lineage will endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This father-son relationship is not only a personal bond but also a royal ideology in the ancient Near East, where kings were often seen as sons of gods. Theologically, this foreshadows the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic line, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>, which quotes this verse to affirm Christ's divine sonship.<p><b>When he does wrong,</b><br>This acknowledges the human nature and fallibility of David's descendants, including Solomon. Despite the divine promise, the kings of Israel and Judah often strayed from God's commandments, leading to consequences. This phrase highlights the conditional aspect of the covenant, where obedience brings blessings, and disobedience brings discipline. It reflects the Deuteronomic principle found throughout the Old Testament, where Israel's prosperity is tied to their faithfulness to God (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>I will discipline him with the rod of men</b><br>The "rod of men" suggests that God will use human agents or circumstances to correct the king. This can be seen in the historical context of Israel's monarchy, where foreign nations often served as instruments of God's discipline. For example, Solomon's later years were marked by political adversaries and internal strife (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-25</a>). This discipline is a form of divine love and correction, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, where God disciplines those He loves.<p><b>and with the blows of the sons of men.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the tangible and sometimes harsh nature of God's discipline through human means. The "blows of the sons of men" can refer to military defeats, political turmoil, or personal hardships faced by the king. Historically, the divided kingdom and subsequent exiles of Israel and Judah serve as examples of such discipline. This also points to the suffering of Christ, who, though sinless, bore the blows of men for the sake of humanity's redemption (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel to whom God made a covenant, promising that his lineage would endure forever.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to David regarding the establishment of his dynasty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, who would build the temple and be the immediate recipient of this promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine speaker in this passage, establishing a covenantal relationship with David's descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David reigned and to whom the promises of a lasting dynasty were significant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_covenant.htm">Understanding God's Covenant</a></b><br>Recognize the significance of God's promise to David and how it points to the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_discipline.htm">Divine Discipline</a></b><br>Reflect on the purpose of God's discipline, which is to correct and guide rather than to punish out of anger.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sonship_and_relationship.htm">Sonship and Relationship</a></b><br>Consider the intimate relationship God desires with His people, as illustrated by the father-son dynamic.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_in_christ.htm">Fulfillment in Christ</a></b><br>See how Old Testament promises find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, who is the perfect Son and King.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_of_god.htm">Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>Trust in God's faithfulness to His promises, as demonstrated through His covenant with David and its fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_7_14_God_s_discipline_love.htm">How does 2 Samuel 7:14 reveal God's discipline and love for His children?

At His baptism the Father declares, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a> ties both verses together, underscoring that God&#8217;s fatherhood over the Messiah is literal and eternal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will be My son</b><p>&#8226; In the ancient world a son represented the father&#8217;s authority; here the Davidic king will act on God&#8217;s behalf, ruling under divine commission (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a> repeats the promise, stressing its permanence: &#8220;I will be his Father, and he will be My son; I will never withdraw My loving devotion from him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3-4</a> highlights both aspects&#8212;physical descent from David and divine Sonship&#8212;showing that Jesus perfectly embodies the promise.<p>&#8226; Because the king is &#8220;My son,&#8221; he enjoys privilege&#8212;yet remains accountable to his Father&#8217;s righteous standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he does wrong, I will discipline him with the rod of men</b><p>&#8226; For Solomon and later kings, &#8220;wrong&#8221; (iniquity) was a real possibility; God&#8217;s covenant love never negated moral responsibility.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;rod of men&#8221; refers to human instruments of correction:<p>&#8211; Adversaries raised against Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-25</a>).<p>&#8211; The kingdom&#8217;s split under Rehoboam (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>).<p>&#8211; Foreign powers like Assyria and Babylon bringing captivity (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>; 24-25).<p>&#8226; Discipline is proof of sonship, not rejection (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, who &#8220;knew no sin&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), the clause is fulfilled vicariously&#8212;He bears chastisement for His people rather than for personal wrongdoing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with the blows of the sons of men</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blows&#8221; intensifies the picture: physical and national hardships administered by human hands. <a href="/psalms/89-32.htm">Psalm 89:32</a> parallels the thought&#8212;&#8220;I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Historically this included sieges, exile, and the suffering of individual kings (e.g., Zedekiah&#8217;s blinding, <a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetically it foreshadows the Messiah&#8217;s passion: &#8220;He was pierced for our transgressions&#8230; by His stripes we are healed&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). Though innocent, Jesus absorbs the &#8220;blows of the sons of men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>) so that believing sinners may become sons and daughters of God (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a> promises a father-son relationship between God and the Davidic king.

The clause is historically true of Solomon and his royal line, assuring that God&#8217;s covenant remains even when they stray. Ultimately the words reach their fullest expression in Jesus Christ: the perfect Son who never sinned, yet willingly bore the rod and blows meant for us, securing an unbreakable covenant and inviting all who trust Him into the Father&#8217;s family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">If he commit iniquity.</span>--The promise has plainly in view a human successor or successors of David upon his throne; and yet it also promises the establishment of David's kingdom FOREVER by an emphatic threefold repetition (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2Samuel 7:16</a>), which can only be fulfilled, and has always been understood as to be fulfilled, in the Messiah. There is a similar promise of a prophet, human and yet more than human, in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15-22</a>, and the explanation in both cases is the same. The Divine word looks forward to a long succession of human prophets or heads of the theocracy who should for the time being, and as far as might be, fill the place of the true Prophet and King, all culminating at last in Him who should fully make known the Father's will and reign over His people, of "whose kingdom there shall be no end." (<a href="/context/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be his Father, and he shall be my son.</span> Between father and son there is not only love, but oneness. Whatsoever the father hath, that belongs also to the son by natural right. But this sonship is magnified in the Psalms beyond the measure of Solomon or any natural limits. The Son there is "the Firstborn," which Solomon was not, "higher than the kings of the earth" (<a href="/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>); and he must have "the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession" (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). Psalms like the second and seventy-second belong, not to Solomon personally, but to him as the type of the prince of Peace; and they help to show us what is the true meaning and fulfilment of the words here. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of men;</span> that is, such punishment as men fitly receive for their faults. David's natural posterity was to be exempt neither from human depravity, nor from punishment, nor from the changes and chances of mortal life. With them, as with men generally, there would be a tangled skein, of virtue and sin, of folly and wisdom, of terrible fall and penitent recovery. But there was to be no blotting out of David's lineage. Great earthly houses, in the long course of events, one after another become extinct, and even the tabernacle of David was to fall (<a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), but not forever. God would "raise up its ruins' in Christ, and "build it as in the days of old." So in <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> there is the same thought of the complete down-hewing of David's earthly lineage, yet only to rise again to nobler life and vigour, in the Branch, or Sucker, that was to spring from the fallen trunk. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;eh&#183;yeh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
