In the cultural context of ancient Israel, mourning customs were well-established, and David's behavior seemed to contradict these norms. Typically, fasting and weeping would follow a death, not precede it. This question highlights the servants' lack of understanding of David's spiritual insight and his relationship with God. It also echoes the broader biblical theme of questioning God's ways, as seen in <a href="/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2-3</a>, where God questions Job, challenging human understanding of divine actions.<p><b>&#8220;his servants asked.&#8221;</b><br>The servants represent the common perspective of the people around David, who are observing his actions closely. In the historical context, servants often had intimate knowledge of the household's affairs and were privy to the personal lives of their masters. Their role here is significant as it provides a narrative device to explore David's internal transformation and understanding of God's will. This interaction also reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where servants could question but not challenge their master's decisions.<p><b>&#8220;While the child was alive, you fasted and wept,&#8221;</b><br>David's fasting and weeping while the child was alive demonstrate his deep repentance and plea for God's mercy. This behavior aligns with the biblical tradition of fasting as a form of supplication and humility before God, as seen in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>, where the people of Nineveh fasted to avert God's judgment. David's actions also reflect his understanding of the gravity of his sin with Bathsheba and the resulting consequences, as Nathan the prophet had pronounced in <a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>. The fasting and weeping signify David's hope that God might relent and spare the child, illustrating the biblical principle of seeking God's compassion.<p><b>&#8220;but when he died, you got up and ate.&#8221;</b><br>David's decision to rise and eat after the child's death signifies acceptance of God's judgment and a return to normalcy. This action is counterintuitive to the expected mourning practices, which would typically involve continued fasting and lamentation. David's behavior demonstrates his faith and submission to God's will, acknowledging that the child's death was part of God's divine plan. This acceptance is reminiscent of Job's response to suffering in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20-21</a>, where he worships God despite his losses. David's actions also foreshadow the New Testament teaching of hope and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>, where believers are encouraged not to grieve as those without hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of his child.
