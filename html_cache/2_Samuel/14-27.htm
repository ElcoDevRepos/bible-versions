His lineage is important as it reflects the continuation of David's line, which is central to the biblical narrative. The mention of three sons suggests the potential for a lasting legacy, although later texts (<a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>) indicate that these sons did not survive to carry on his name. This detail highlights the tragic elements of Absalom's life and rebellion against his father, David. The number three often symbolizes completeness or stability in biblical literature, yet in Absalom's case, it ironically underscores the instability and eventual downfall of his house.<p><b>and a daughter named Tamar</b><br>The naming of Absalom's daughter Tamar is significant, as it reflects Absalom's deep affection for his sister Tamar, who suffered greatly due to the actions of their half-brother Amnon (2 Samuel 13). By naming his daughter after his sister, Absalom honors her and perhaps seeks to preserve her memory and dignity. This act can be seen as a form of familial loyalty and a desire for justice, themes that are prevalent in Absalom's story. The name Tamar, meaning "palm tree," symbolizes beauty and grace, which is fitting given the description of her as a beautiful woman.<p><b>who was a beautiful woman</b><br>The emphasis on Tamar's beauty is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, where physical appearance often plays a role in the unfolding of events. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, beauty could be both a blessing and a source of vulnerability, as seen in the stories of Sarah, Rachel, and Esther. Tamar's beauty may also foreshadow the future events in Absalom's life, where appearances and charisma play significant roles in his attempt to usurp the throne from David. This detail connects to the broader biblical theme of how external beauty can influence human actions and divine plans, reminding readers of the deeper spiritual truths beyond physical appearances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.

The only reasonable conclusion is that these sons died young, illustrating how disobedience can erode even God-given blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s three unnamed boys highlight a contrast with the Lord&#8217;s detailed record of other lineages (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-9</a>). Their anonymity underscores how rebellion can strip a legacy of lasting significance (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a daughter named Tamar</b><p>&#8226; Absalom deliberately honors his sister, Tamar, who was violated by their brother Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1-20</a>). Naming his daughter after her keeps that injustice in view and reveals Absalom&#8217;s protective heart toward the women in his family.<p>&#8226; This choice also demonstrates how family wounds can shape later generations. Compare Naomi renaming herself &#8220;Mara&#8221; after tragedy (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God records this girl&#8217;s name even when her brothers&#8217; names are omitted, showing His concern for those who suffer wrongs (<a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was a beautiful woman</b><p>&#8226; Physical beauty already marks Absalom&#8217;s line&#8212;&#8220;In all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>). Tamar shares that family trait.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs beauty with both blessing and danger. Rebekah&#8217;s looks opened doors (<a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a>), while David&#8217;s glance at Bathsheba led to sin (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God values inner character above appearance: &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Tamar&#8217;s beauty is noted, yet her worth ultimately rests in being known by God (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a> records Absalom&#8217;s four children to show God&#8217;s blessing of offspring, to reveal how past family pain influenced his choices, and to spotlight the fleeting nature of earthly glory. Though Absalom once enjoyed a full house, later events erased his sons from history, while his daughter&#8217;s remembered beauty reminds us that God notices every individual detail. The verse quietly warns that only obedience secures a lasting legacy, even amid the gifts God graciously provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Three sons.</span>--Their names are not given, from which it might be supposed that they died in infancy, and this is made sure by <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2Samuel 18:18</a>, where Absalom is reported as saying, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance."<p><span class= "bld">One daughter.</span>--This daughter bore the name of Absalom's sister, Tamar, and shared her beauty. The LXX. here inserts the statement that she "became the wife of Roboam, the son of Solomon, and bore him a son, Abia." But this is evidently a confused gloss, founded upon <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm" title="Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.">1Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20-22</a>. We are there told that Rehoboam's favourite wife was Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, and mother of Abijah; but this must mean that Maachah was his granddaughter through Tamar, since in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm" title="He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.">2Chronicles 13:2</a> Abijah is called the son of Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel. Tamar then married Uriel, and her daughter became the mother of a line of kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three sons.</span> Their names are not given, because they died early (see <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>). Of his daughter <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, named after her aunt, and, like her, possessed of great beauty, the Septuagint adds that she became the wife of Rehoboam, and mother of Abijah. In <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> we are told that Abijah's mother was "Maachah the daughter of Abishalom;" and in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> that her name was "Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." We thus gather that Tamar married Uriel, and that it was the granddaughter of Absalom who became Rehoboam's queen. It is strictly in accordance with Hebrew custom to call Absalom's granddaughter his daughter, and, as Uriel was a man of no political importance, he is passed over, as the narrator's object was to show that Abijah's mother was sprung from the handsome and notorious son of David (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20, 21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were born</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiw&#183;w&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
