As a warrior and king, David experienced physical needs and desires like any other person. This longing occurs during a time when David was in the stronghold, likely during a Philistine occupation of Bethlehem. The longing for water symbolizes a deeper yearning for peace and restoration of his homeland. It also reflects the spiritual thirst for God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, where the psalmist expresses a deep desire for God like a deer pants for water.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water</b><br>David's expression is not a command but a wistful desire. It demonstrates his leadership style, where his men are motivated by love and loyalty rather than obligation. This longing is reminiscent of the Israelites' desire for water in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>), highlighting human dependency on God's provision. It also foreshadows Jesus' offer of living water in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>, where He provides spiritual sustenance that quenches eternal thirst.<p><b>from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221;</b><br>Bethlehem, David's hometown, holds significant historical and prophetic importance. The well near the gate represents a source of life and sustenance, a common gathering place in ancient cities. This location is significant as Bethlehem is also the prophesied birthplace of Jesus (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), connecting David's longing to the future hope found in Christ. The well symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promises and the ultimate satisfaction found in Jesus, the living water. The mention of the gate indicates a place of community and decision-making, emphasizing the strategic and emotional importance of Bethlehem to David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his leadership.

Under siege and likely short on supplies, David feels real physical thirst.<p>&#8226; His desire is literal&#8212;he wants actual water. Yet Scripture often links thirst with deeper spiritual yearning (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>). David&#8217;s hometown well represents both refreshment for his body and a reminder of God&#8217;s past faithfulness in Bethlehem, the place where the Lord first chose him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; This longing shows David&#8217;s humanity. Even God&#8217;s anointed king experiences basic needs, foreshadowing the greater Son of David who would also thirst (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; David &#8220;said&#8221; what he was feeling. It is not a command but a wistful sigh. Still, words spoken by a leader carry weight (<a href="/2_samuel/23-16.htm">2 Samuel 23:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode highlights how influence works: people who love their leader often act on even casual remarks. Compare David&#8217;s earlier habit of voicing needs to the LORD in prayer (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>) with this spontaneous expression.<p>&#8226; The contrast teaches that our off-hand words matter&#8212;we never know who may take them as marching orders (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water</b><p>&#8226; The phrase reveals intensity. &#8220;Oh, that&#8221; is the language of longing, not entitlement.<p>&#8226; Three of David&#8217;s mighty men hear and risk everything to fulfill it, breaking through enemy lines (<a href="/2_samuel/23-16.htm">2 Samuel 23:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">1 Chronicles 11:17-19</a>). Their act pictures sacrificial devotion, a living example of Jesus&#8217; teaching about giving &#8220;even a cup of cold water&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>).<p>&#8226; David later refuses to drink, pouring it out &#8220;to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-17.htm">2 Samuel 23:17</a>). He recognizes that water gained at the price of blood belongs to God alone&#8212;underscoring the sacredness of life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!</b><p>&#8226; Bethlehem is David&#8217;s birthplace and would become the birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4-7</a>). The private craving of Israel&#8217;s king points forward to the true King who offers &#8220;living water&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p>&#8226; The well by the gate served as the town&#8217;s communal source; the gate itself was the hub of civic life (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>). David&#8217;s memory of that familiar spot underlines how exile heightens appreciation for ordinary blessings.<p>&#8226; That the well was inside enemy-held territory magnifies the courage of the three warriors and the value David placed on the water&#8212;fresh, pure, and tied to covenant promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s passing wish for water from Bethlehem, voiced while hiding from Philistine forces, reveals his physical need, homesickness, and spiritual thirst all at once. His devoted men turn that wish into a daring mission, and David&#8217;s refusal to drink what they risked their lives to bring shows deep reverence for the sanctity of life and for God, to whom he ultimately directs his longing. The verse therefore teaches about the power of words, the cost of true devotion, and the way everyday desires can point us to the greater refreshment found in the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The well of Bethlehem.</span>--There are now no wells of living water at Bethlehem itself, the town being supplied by an aqueduct.
