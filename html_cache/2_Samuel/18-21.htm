His decision to send a Cushite, likely an Ethiopian, reflects the presence of diverse ethnic groups within Israel's sphere of influence. Cushites were known for their speed and endurance, making them ideal messengers. This choice also indicates Joab's strategic thinking, as he may have wanted to distance himself from the direct delivery of potentially distressing news to King David.<p><b>&#8220;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&#8221;</b><br>Joab instructs the Cushite to report the outcome of the battle to King David. This reflects the ancient practice of using messengers to convey important news. The phrase "what you have seen" suggests that the Cushite was an eyewitness to the events, lending credibility to his report. This moment is pivotal, as it involves the sensitive task of informing David about the death of his son Absalom, which Joab had orchestrated despite David's explicit instructions to deal gently with him.<p><b>The Cushite bowed to Joab</b><br>The act of bowing signifies respect and acknowledgment of Joab's authority. In the cultural context of the time, such gestures were common in hierarchical relationships, especially between a commander and his subordinates. This deference underscores Joab's position of power and the obedience expected from those under his command.<p><b>and took off running.</b><br>The Cushite's immediate departure highlights the urgency of the message. Running was a common mode of travel for messengers in ancient times, emphasizing the importance of speed in delivering news. This urgency is compounded by the gravity of the message concerning Absalom's fate. The act of running also symbolizes the weight of responsibility placed on the messenger, as he carries news that will deeply affect King David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

He now chooses a &#8220;Cushite,&#8221; likely an Ethiopian soldier in his service.<p>&#8226; The choice is deliberate:<p>&#8211; A foreigner can deliver a difficult message without the emotional entanglements an Israelite like Ahimaaz would feel (compare <a href="/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8211; Joab&#8217;s action shows military pragmatism; he wants someone who will state facts, not soften them.<p>&#8226; Scripture often records God using outsiders to carry truth (e.g., Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>; the Magi in <a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1&#8211;12</a>). Here, an unnamed Cushite becomes the instrument for conveying God&#8217;s unfolding judgment on David&#8217;s household, fulfilling Nathan&#8217;s prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go, tell the king what you have seen</b><p>&#8226; The command is simple and factual, mirroring the obligation of a witness (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Biblical messengers carry what they have &#8220;seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>). The Cushite&#8217;s report will confirm Absalom&#8217;s death and Israel&#8217;s victory (<a href="/2_samuel/18-31.htm">2 Samuel 18:31&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s directive echoes other dispatches sent to kings after battle (<a href="/2_samuel/11-18.htm">2 Samuel 11:18&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41&#8211;45</a>).

Though a foreigner, the Cushite honors the chain of command God has established (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Respect precedes service. Before running, he first humbles himself&#8212;an attitude God consistently blesses (<a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture also reassures Joab that the message will be delivered faithfully, paralleling Isaiah&#8217;s picture of messengers with &#8220;beautiful feet&#8221; who bring good news (<a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took off running</b><p>&#8226; The verb paints eagerness.

This is not a proper name, but signifies that he was an Ethiopian in Joab's service. Joab was unwilling to expose Ahimaaz to me king's displeasure, and we gather from ver. 27 that the sending of a person of low rank would be understood to signify evil tidings. The bearer of good news received a present, and therefore the passing over all Joab's personal friends to send a slave was proof that the message was not expected to bring the bearer honour or reward. And Joab was quite right in supposing that David would be more displeased at his son's death than pleased at the victory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
