In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the LORD often came upon individuals to empower them for specific tasks or to deliver God's message, as seen with prophets like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>). This reflects the belief that the Holy Spirit was active in the lives of God's chosen leaders, guiding them to fulfill His purposes. The phrase also underscores the role of the Holy Spirit in the inspiration of Scripture, a concept further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><b>His word was on my tongue.</b><br>This indicates that the words spoken by David were not his own but were given to him by God. This concept of divine speech is seen throughout the Bible, where God uses human agents to communicate His will, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>) and the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). The phrase suggests a direct and intimate communication from God, ensuring the accuracy and authority of the message. It also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), who perfectly communicated God's will and character to humanity. This connection between divine inspiration and human speech is foundational to the understanding of biblical prophecy and the authority of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, King David, is reflecting on his life and the divine inspiration he received.
