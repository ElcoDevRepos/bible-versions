This reflects the human condition of leaders who, despite their authority, experience moments of weakness. In the broader biblical narrative, this highlights the theme of reliance on God rather than personal strength. David's admission of weakness is reminiscent of Paul's words in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where God's power is made perfect in weakness.<p><b>though anointed as king</b><br>David was anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), signifying God's choice and blessing. Despite this divine appointment, David's path to kingship was fraught with challenges, including Saul's pursuit and internal strife within his own ranks. The anointing signifies God's promise and purpose, yet it does not exempt David from trials, illustrating the tension between divine promise and earthly reality.<p><b>and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me</b><br>The sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, were David's nephews and key military leaders. Their fierce nature and actions often conflicted with David's more measured approach. This tension highlights the challenges of leadership and the difficulty of managing strong-willed subordinates. Joab's actions, in particular, often put David in difficult positions, as seen in his unauthorized killing of Abner earlier in this chapter.<p><b>May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!</b><br>David entrusts justice to God, reflecting a key biblical principle of divine retribution. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord." David's reliance on God for justice underscores his faith and the biblical theme that ultimate justice belongs to God. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are encouraged to leave room for God's wrath rather than seeking personal vengeance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, expressing his vulnerability and frustration with the sons of Zeruiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_zeruiah.htm">Sons of Zeruiah</a></b><br>Refers primarily to Joab and Abishai, David's nephews and military commanders, known for their harshness and violence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zeruiah.htm">Zeruiah</a></b><br>David's sister, mother of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, whose sons played significant roles in David's military campaigns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom David calls upon to judge and repay the evildoer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evildoer.htm">Evildoer</a></b><br>In this context, likely refers to Joab, who had just killed Abner, an act that David disapproved of.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_human_weakness.htm">Acknowledging Human Weakness</a></b><br>David's admission of weakness reminds us that even those in positions of power need God's strength.

As it was, though an anointed king, he had but one tribe loyal to him; the rest were the subjects of a rival; and the Philistines were oppressing all alike. Had Abner's enterprise been carried out, all the tribes would have been united under his sway. He could thus have made head against the Philistines, and Abner, in command of the Benjamites and other tribes, would have curbed the fierce self-will of Joab. As it was, the sons of Zeruiah might be reprimanded, and could not treat David as Abner had treated Ishbosheth; but they were indispensable. David had a strange set of men around him in those outlaws (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and Joab, brave, skilful, and unscrupulous, was a man after their own heart. They had just returned with great booty from a foray under his command; and it was a brave and manly thing in David to reprove him so openly, and dismiss him from his command. Had he attempted more, and Joab had stood upon the defence, there were plenty of "men of Belial" (<a href="/1_samuel/30-22.htm">1 Samuel 30:22</a>) to side with him, and David might have met with the fate threatened him at Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). As it was, he proved himself to be king, and Joab, in spite of everything, remained a most faithful officer, and the right hand man in his kingdom, and one even trusted with perilous and disgraceful secrets (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I [am]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
