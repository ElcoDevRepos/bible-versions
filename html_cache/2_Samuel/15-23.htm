The weeping signifies the emotional turmoil and the gravity of the situation. The countryside refers to the areas surrounding Jerusalem, indicating that the news of David's departure had spread widely, affecting not just the city but the surrounding regions. This communal lamentation echoes other biblical instances of collective mourning, such as in the book of Lamentations, where the destruction of Jerusalem is mourned. The people's loyalty to David is evident, as their weeping reflects their support and the fear of the unknown future under Absalom's rule.<p><b>And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley,</b><br>The Kidron Valley is a significant geographical location east of Jerusalem, often associated with moments of crisis and decision in the Bible. It serves as a boundary between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. David's crossing of the Kidron Valley is symbolic of his departure from the city and the throne, a humbling moment for the king. This valley is also mentioned in the New Testament, where Jesus crosses it on His way to the Garden of Gethsemane, drawing a parallel between David's suffering and Jesus' own path to the crucifixion. The Kidron Valley thus becomes a place of sorrow and reflection, marking pivotal moments in biblical history.<p><b>all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness.</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing and reliance on God, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey during the Exodus. David's movement toward the wilderness signifies a retreat to a place of refuge and divine dependence, away from the political intrigue of Jerusalem. This journey into the wilderness can be seen as a time of purification and preparation, much like Jesus' time in the wilderness before His public ministry. The wilderness is often a setting for divine encounters and revelations, suggesting that David's faith and leadership would be refined through this trial. The people's willingness to follow David into the wilderness underscores their loyalty and trust in his leadership, despite the uncertain future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

The direction of David's flight was toward the wild country on the east of the Jordan, in which Ishbosheth had found a refuge after the defeat of Gilboa. To reach it he must pass by Jericho, and thence through the Arabah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>) to the ford of the Jordan, after crossing which he would be in comparative safety. Ahithophel would have followed that very night, and have attacked before David had placed the river between himself and his pursuers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Everyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
