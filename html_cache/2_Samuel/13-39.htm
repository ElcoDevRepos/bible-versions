Despite Absalom's actions, which included the murder of his brother Amnon, David's paternal instincts and love for his son remain strong. This longing can be seen as a reflection of God's enduring love for His children, even when they stray. The tension between justice and mercy is a recurring theme in David's life, mirroring the divine balance God maintains with humanity. David's desire to reconcile with Absalom also highlights the importance of forgiveness and restoration in relationships, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<p><b>for he had been consoled over Amnon&#8217;s death</b><br>David's consolation over Amnon's death suggests a passage of time and a process of grieving. In the ancient Near Eastern context, mourning was a significant cultural practice, often involving specific rituals and periods of lamentation. The fact that David had been consoled indicates that he had moved through the stages of grief and was now in a place where he could consider reconciliation with Absalom. This phrase also underscores the inevitability of healing and the human capacity to move forward after loss. The death of Amnon, while tragic, was a consequence of the sin and dysfunction within David's family, a reminder of the prophetic words spoken by Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a> regarding the sword never departing from David's house.

Yet David has now accepted that Amnon is gone.<p>- The phrase underscores that David&#8217;s consolation is specific: he is no longer paralyzed by mourning for Amnon, freeing him to address the estrangement with Absalom.<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a>, where David accepted the death of his infant son and moved forward in faith; a similar acceptance is seen here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a> shows a father-king whose intense mourning for one son has subsided enough to awaken a longing for reconciliation with another. David&#8217;s heart, no longer dominated by grief, yearns to bridge the gap with Absalom, illustrating both the powerful pull of parental love and the possibility of renewed relationship after tragedy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">The soul of King David.</span>--The words, "the soul of," are not in the original, and the most opposite interpretations have been given of the rest of the sentence. The sense of the English is that of the Chaldee and of the Jewish commentators--that David, after his grief for Amnon had abated, longed after Absalom and pined for his return. But it may be objected to this view, (1) that there is no ground for supplying the ellipsis in this way; (2) that the verb (which is a common one) never has elsewhere the sense given to it; and (3) that the representation thus made is contrary to fact, since David could easily have recalled Absalom had he chosen to do so, and when he actually was brought back, through Joab's stratagem, the king refused to see him (<a href="/2_samuel/14-24.htm" title="And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.">2Samuel 14:24</a>), and only after two years more (<a href="/2_samuel/14-28.htm" title="So Absalom dwelled two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.">2Samuel 14:28</a>), reluctantly admitted him to his presence. The other interpretation is better, which takes the verb impersonally, and gives the sense, <span class= "ital">David desisted from going forth against Absalom. </span>He ought to have arrested and punished him for a murder, which was at once fratricide and high treason, as being the assassination of the heir-apparent; but the flight to Geshur made this difficult, and as time went by David "was comforted concerning Amnon," and gradually gave up the thought of punishing Absalom.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">the soul of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">king David longed to go forth unto Absalom.</span> This translation has the support of the Jewish Targum, and, as the verb is feminine, the insertion of the added word is possible, though the sense seems to require "anger" instead of "the soul." But the versions (Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate) all give the verb its ordinary meaning of "ceasing," and, though there is something harsh in taking it impersonally, yet their authority is too great for us to say that such a mode of rendering it must be wrong. And if the grammar be difficult, the sense put upon the words by the versions is excellent. Literally they are, <span class="accented">As to King David, there. was a ceasing to go forth after Absalom</span>; <span class="accented">for he was comforted</span>, etc. At first he had demanded of Talmai the surrender of the offender, and, when Talmai refused, David tried other means; but in time, when his grief for Amnon was assuaged, he desisted from his efforts. But even so it required much subtlety on Joab's part to obtain Absalom's recall, which would scarcely have been the case if David's soul was longing for his son's return; and, even after his coming, David long maintained an unfriendly attitude. Amnon was his firstborn, and evidently dearly loved, but David's culpable leniency had borne bitter fruit. And again he acts without thoughtful sense of justice, and though at first he would have given Absalom merited punishment, yet gradually paternal feeling resumed its sway, unhappily only to be miserably abused. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
