David, as a king, was responsible for military decisions and the welfare of his troops. His anger would be justified if he perceived a tactical error. This reflects the responsibility and accountability of leadership, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in the leadership of Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) and the kings of Israel.<p><b>he may ask you</b><br>The use of "he may ask you" indicates a direct communication between the king and his messenger, highlighting the importance of delivering messages accurately. This reflects the role of prophets and messengers in the Bible, who were tasked with conveying God's word to the people, such as Nathan confronting David later in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Why did you get so close to the city to fight?</b><br>This question points to a tactical error in the battle strategy. In ancient warfare, approaching a fortified city too closely without proper siege equipment was dangerous. The historical context of warfare during this period often involved sieges, as seen in the conquest of Jericho (Joshua 6). The question implies a lack of wisdom or foresight, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, contrasting human error with divine wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>Did you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall?</b><br>This phrase underscores the common military practice of defending a city from its walls. Archers and soldiers would use the height advantage to repel attackers. The mention of shooting from the wall connects to other biblical accounts of city defenses, such as the defense of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of ignoring known dangers, paralleling spiritual vigilance in the New Testament (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who orchestrates the battle plan and later becomes entangled in sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who is responsible for executing David's orders in the battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, whose death is orchestrated by David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city from which David rules and where he remains while his army is at war.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The military engagement against the Ammonites, during which Uriah is placed in a vulnerable position.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate how sin can lead to a cascade of further sins and consequences.

After years of leading Israel&#8217;s armies (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; 8:15), David was quick to spot strategic blunders, and anger was a predictable response (<a href="/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>; 19:12).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals tension: Joab&#8217;s tactics at Rabbah appear reckless, yet they serve David&#8217;s hidden agenda to see Uriah killed (<a href="/2_samuel/11-15.htm">2 Samuel 11:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture here underscores both the reality of righteous authority resenting incompetence (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>) and the tragic irony that David&#8217;s private sin is steering public policy (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he may ask you</b><p>&#8226; Joab prepares the messenger for interrogation, reflecting the chain-of-command accountability seen elsewhere in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/1_samuel/26-15.htm">1 Samuel 26:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-13.htm">2 Samuel 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By scripting the exchange, Joab attempts to manage David&#8217;s anger and shift focus toward the &#8220;good news&#8221; of Uriah&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene exposes Joab&#8217;s shrewdness&#8212;he serves the king, yet manipulates events to shield himself and implicate David further (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why did you get so close to the city to fight?</b><p>&#8226; Ancient siege warfare required distance: staying out of arrow and stone range (<a href="/2_kings/14-10.htm">2 Kings 14:10</a>). Joab had breached that unwritten rule.<p>&#8226; David would immediately recall the disastrous precedent of Abimelech at Thebez, where a woman dropped a millstone on his head when he fought too near the wall (<a href="/judges/9-50.htm">Judges 9:50-54</a>, explicitly cited in <a href="/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus the question reflects sound battlefield wisdom, which Joab knowingly violated to see Uriah exposed (<a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall?</b><p>&#8226; City walls were elevated firing platforms (<a href="/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a>). Any competent commander understood the lethal zone beneath them.<p>&#8226; Joab banked on that certainty. By ordering men close, he guaranteed casualties, including Uriah, while retaining plausible deniability.<p>&#8226; The rhetorical sting of David&#8217;s expected words highlights the contrast between military prudence and sinful manipulation (<a href="/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/11-20.htm">2 Samuel 11:20</a> captures Joab&#8217;s instructions to a messenger who will face David&#8217;s predictable anger over poor tactics. Joab anticipates the king&#8217;s objections&#8212;drawing too near the wall invites deadly missiles&#8212;and crafts a reply that will divert blame and spotlight Uriah&#8217;s death. The verse exposes the layers of David&#8217;s concealed sin: it corrupts military judgment, endangers troops, and entangles subordinates in deceit. Scripture records the episode with factual precision, reminding readers of the high cost of hidden transgression and the inescapable principles of accountability, leadership integrity, and the sovereignty of God over human schemes (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>;
