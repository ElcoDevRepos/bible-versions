The "fords of the wilderness" likely refer to the crossing points of the Jordan River, a natural boundary and a place of refuge. Historically, the wilderness was a place of testing and preparation, as seen in the lives of Moses and Elijah. The wilderness also symbolizes a place of divine encounter and reliance on God, as David waits for guidance. This setting connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people finding refuge and direction in desolate places.<p><b>until word comes from you to inform me.</b><br>David's reliance on communication underscores the importance of intelligence and strategy in his leadership. The phrase highlights the role of messengers in ancient times, who were crucial for relaying information. This reliance on word from others reflects David's trust in his loyal supporters, such as Hushai and the priests Zadok and Abiathar, who stayed in Jerusalem to gather intelligence. This situation parallels the need for discernment and wisdom in leadership, as seen in other biblical narratives. David's dependence on his allies foreshadows the ultimate reliance on God's guidance, a theme prevalent throughout his life and reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

Instead of panic, David speaks calmly, signaling confidence in God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will wait</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By pledging to wait, David contrasts himself with Saul, who lost the kingdom by refusing to wait (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; This stance reveals humble submission to God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the fords of the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;fords&#8221; refer to shallow crossings of the Jordan, a natural checkpoint (<a href="/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>; <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This spot gives David quick access back to Jerusalem while providing a buffer from Absalom.<p>&#8226; The location recalls earlier redemptive moments at the Jordan&#8212;the entry into Canaan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s parting (<a href="/2_kings/2-6.htm">2 Kings 2:6</a>)&#8212;reminding readers of God&#8217;s past deliverance.<p>&#8226;

This conjecture is the substitution of <span class="accented">arboth</span> for <span class="accented">abroth</span>, and they have made the same alteration at <a href="/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>. But the substitution is uncalled for and mischievous; for David would not halt indefinitely in the plain, the Arabah (of which Arboth is the plural), but would press on to the fords, where some delay must take place, and where the king's presence would be important in giving instructions for what was by no means an easy operation (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/19-18.htm">2 Samuel 19:18</a>). At the river, moreover, David could be assailed only in front, where his "mighties" would make a strong defence, while in the Arabah they might be surrounded; and, encumbered as they were with women, their line must be so extended as to be weakened. We find, too, in <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a> that the fords of the Jordan formed a good military position. In <a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a> it is expressly said that the fording of the river did not take place until Jonathan and Ahimaaz came with their reports; and their words there, in ver, 21, show that David was on the bank when they arrived, with his preparations so complete, that, in the next few hours, all his company were safely carried over to the other side. Ahimaaz was a famous runner (see <a href="/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>), and, if David was ready, the time gained by him upon any body of troops leaving Jerusalem at the same hour, would have enabled the king to get his people across; but if he had still some miles to march, with a number of women and children, Ahimaaz's fleetness would have been rendered useless. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">See,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wait</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;mah&#183;m&#234;&#183;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">To question, hesitate, to be reluctant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the fords</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;ar&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
