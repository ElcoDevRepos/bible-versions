This event follows Absalom's successful campaign to win the hearts of the people of Israel, as described earlier in 2 Samuel. Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, is a key location, symbolizing the seat of power. Absalom's entry into the city signifies his attempt to usurp David's throne. Historically, Jerusalem was a fortified city, making it a strategic target for any would-be ruler. The phrase "all the men of Israel" suggests widespread support for Absalom, highlighting the division within the nation and the extent of his influence.<p><b>and Ahithophel was with him</b><br>Ahithophel, once a trusted advisor to King David, is now aligned with Absalom. His presence with Absalom is significant, as Ahithophel was renowned for his wisdom and counsel, often compared to consulting the word of God (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). His defection to Absalom's side represents a deep betrayal and underscores the gravity of the political crisis David faces. Ahithophel's involvement also fulfills Nathan's prophecy of turmoil within David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>). This betrayal can be seen as a type of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, where a close confidant turns against the anointed leader. Ahithophel's counsel would have been seen as a great asset to Absalom, further legitimizing his claim to the throne in the eyes of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, who led a rebellion against his father to seize the throne of Israel.

&#8216;Arise and let us flee&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>), proving the threat is real, not symbolic.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is still at work: David&#8217;s line has been promised an everlasting throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), so even Absalom&#8217;s coup cannot derail God&#8217;s covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the men of Israel</b><p>The phrase underscores the breadth of support Absalom has gathered.<p>&#8226; The northern tribes and large segments of Judah have rallied to him (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Mass participation gives the appearance of legitimacy, yet majority opinion does not equal divine approval&#8212;see the golden calf incident (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>).<p>&#8226; While Absalom claims the capital, the true King&#8212;both David and ultimately Christ&#8212;will regain it in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Ahithophel was with him</b><p>Ahithophel, once David&#8217;s trusted counselor, now aids the usurper.<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God answers David&#8217;s prayer to &#8220;turn Ahithophel&#8217;s counsel into foolishness&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>) by prompting Hushai and Absalom to reject it, leading to Ahithophel&#8217;s despairing suicide (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14, 23</a>).<p>&#8226; Betrayal by a friend foreshadows Judas&#8217;s betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>), illustrating how God weaves even treachery into His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15</a> captures the moment Absalom&#8217;s revolt appears victorious: the charismatic son, the backing of Israel&#8217;s masses, the capture of Jerusalem, and the strategic genius of Ahithophel. Yet the verse also signals the limits of human rebellion. God&#8217;s covenant with David stands firm, His sovereignty directs every event, and those who oppose His anointed ultimately fall. The passage invites confidence that, regardless of appearances, the Lord&#8217;s purposes prevail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Absalom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
