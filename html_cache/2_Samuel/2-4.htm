Hebron, a significant city in Judah, was historically a city of refuge and a Levitical city. It was also where Abraham settled and was buried, adding to its spiritual and ancestral importance. The choice of Hebron as the place for David's anointing underscores its status as a center of power and heritage within Judah.<p><b>and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah</b><br>This anointing marks the beginning of David's reign, though initially only over Judah, not all Israel. The act of anointing signifies divine selection and empowerment for leadership, echoing Samuel's earlier anointing of David as king. This event fulfills part of God's promise to David, setting the stage for his eventual rule over all Israel. The anointing also prefigures Christ, the Anointed One, who would come from David's line.<p><b>And they told David, &#8220;It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.&#8221;</b><br>The men of Jabesh-gilead had shown loyalty to Saul by retrieving and burying his body after his death in battle. This act of respect and bravery was significant, as Jabesh-gilead had historical ties to Saul, who had once rescued them from the Ammonites. By informing David of their actions, the men of Judah highlight the continued respect for Saul's legacy and the complex political landscape David would navigate. This acknowledgment also sets the stage for David's diplomatic response, which would further solidify his leadership and unify the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed as king over the house of Judah, marking the beginning of his reign over part of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The tribe that first recognized David's leadership and anointed him as their king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city in Gilead, east of the Jordan River, whose men showed loyalty to Saul by burying him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose death led to the transition of power to David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/anointing.htm">Anointing</a></b><br>A significant act of consecration and recognition of God's chosen leader.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Timing and Sovereignty</a></b><br>David's anointing over Judah demonstrates God's perfect timing and sovereignty in establishing leadership.

Comp. Saul's anointing by Samuel privately (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>), and his subsequent double recognition as king by the people (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm" title="And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.">1Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1Samuel 11:15</a>). The "men of Judah" were not only of David's tribe, but were doubtless aware of his having been divinely selected for their future king, and, for the most part, had been on friendly terms with him during his long outlawry; they had also lately received presents from him in recognition of their kindness (<a href="/context/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26-31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The men of Jabesh-gilead.</span>--This town had been destroyed in the civil war against the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/context/judges/21-9.htm" title="For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.">Judges 21:9-12</a>), and its 400 virgins given in marriage to the surviving Benjamites. There was therefore a special connection between Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin, and this city. It is altogether probable also that the remnants of Saul's defeated army had sought refuge in Gilead. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David.</span> Samuel's anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) had been private, and, if we may judge by the manner in which Eliab treated David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>), even his own family had not attached much importance to it. It was nevertheless the indication of Jehovah's purpose, and now the anointing of David by the elders of Judah was the first step towards its accomplishment. And this was an independent act, though the knowledge of Samuel's anointing had prepared the way for it; and David thus acquired a legal right and authority by the nation's will, which Samuel could not have given him. So Saul's anointing by Samuel, and his election to be king at Gilgal, were independent acts; and while the former gave the king his sacredness, the latter conferred upon him jurisdiction and power. <span class="cmt_word">King over the house of Judah.</span> How came the Philistines to allow this? When subsequently he was again anointed, and became King of all Israel, the Philistines gathered their hosts at once; not because he captured Jerusalem, which was then a mere hill fort belonging to the Jebusites, but evidently because they thought him dangerous. But why did they not crush him now? One reason, probably, was that Judaea was a difficult country for military operations. The tribe, too, had stood aloof from Saul, and its strength was unbroken. But the chief reason apparently was that David maintained friendly relations with Achish, and paid him tribute. This explains the curious fact that Ziklag continued to be the private property of the house of David (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). The doings of a vassal of the King of Gath were regarded as of little importance. Had he not even marched with them to Aphek, as one of the servants of Achish?
