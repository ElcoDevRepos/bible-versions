It reflects the human condition post-Fall, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where mortality is introduced as a consequence of sin. The certainty of death serves as a reminder of the brevity of life and the need for reconciliation with God.<p><b>and be like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered.</b><br>This imagery emphasizes the finality and irreversibility of death. In ancient Near Eastern culture, water was a precious resource, and once spilled, it was lost forever. This metaphor highlights the transient nature of human life, similar to <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compares life to grass that withers. It underscores the urgency of seeking God's grace before it's too late.<p><b>Yet God does not take away a life,</b><br>Here, the text contrasts human mortality with God's mercy. While death is a natural consequence of sin, God&#8217;s character is one of compassion and patience (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). This reflects His desire for repentance and restoration rather than destruction, aligning with <a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, where God expresses no pleasure in the death of the wicked.<p><b>but He devises ways that the banished one may not be cast out from Him.</b><br>This phrase reveals God's redemptive plan and His initiative in restoring the estranged. It foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Jesus Christ, who is the way back to God (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The concept of devising ways is seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), illustrating God's readiness to welcome back those who return to Him.

Our lives are fleeting and irrevocably lost like spilled water; yet God, unwilling to let the banished remain exiled, crafts a pathway back. The verse foreshadows the gospel: though sin sentences us to death, the Lord&#8217;s mercy triumphs through His redemptive plan, inviting every repentant heart into restored relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">We must needs die.</span>--The woman now goes on to a further argument from the uncertainty of life. Whether she would suggest the possibility of Absalom's dying in banishment (as some think), or of David's death before he has been reconciled to his son (as others hold) does not matter. She craftily withdraws attention from the real point--the question of right and justice--and, assuming that the thing ought to be done, suggests that delay is unsafe since life is uncertain. Still another explanation of her argument may be given: "Amnon is dead, and it is <span class= "ital">useless </span>to grieve longer for him; God does not respect persons, Absalom too must die, and you yourself must die; improve the time and the blessings yet left while there is opportunity."<p><span class= "bld">Neither doth God respect any person.</span>--The Hebrew is difficult, but the English is certainly wrong. The literal translation is "And God doth not take away the soul, but thinketh thoughts that He may not banish the banished one;" and the meaning is that God in wrath remembers mercy, and does not press punishment to extremes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither doth God,</span> etc. This translation is altogether wrong. What the woman says is, "God taketh not life [Hebrew, 'a soul'] away, but thinketh thoughts not to banish from him his banished one." Her argument is that death is the common lot, and that there is no way of bringing back the dead to life. But though death is thus a universal law, yet God does not kill. Death is not a penalty exacted as a punishment, but, on the contrary, he is merciful, and when a man has sinned, instead of putting him to death, he is ready to forgive and welcome back one rejected because of his wickedness. The application is plain. The king cannot restore Amnon to life, and neither must he kill the guilty Absalom, but must recall his banished son. The argument is full of poetry, and touching to the feelings, but is not very sound. For God requires repentance and change of heart; and there was no sign of contrition on Absalom's part. The power of the woman's appeal lay in what she says of God's nature. He is not intent on punishing, nor bent on carrying out the sentences of the Law in their stern literalness; but he is ready to forgive, and "deviseth devices" to bring home those now separate from him. There is also much that is worth pondering over in the distinction between death as a law of nature, and death as a penalty.
