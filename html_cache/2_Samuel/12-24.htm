This reflects David's role as a husband seeking to console his wife in her grief. The use of "his wife" signifies the legitimacy of their union post-repentance, contrasting with the earlier illicit nature of their relationship. This moment also highlights the restoration of their relationship and the beginning of a new chapter in their lives.<p><b>and he went to her and lay with her</b><br>This phrase indicates the resumption of marital relations between David and Bathsheba. It signifies a return to normalcy and the continuation of life after a period of mourning. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the act of lying together was not only for procreation but also an expression of intimacy and unity within marriage. This act leads to the birth of Solomon, a significant figure in biblical history.<p><b>So she gave birth to a son</b><br>The birth of a son is a pivotal moment, as it represents hope and the continuation of David's lineage. In the historical context, sons were often seen as a blessing and a means of carrying on the family name and legacy. This birth is particularly significant as it follows a period of judgment and loss, symbolizing God's grace and the potential for redemption and new beginnings.<p><b>and they named him Solomon</b><br>The name Solomon is derived from the Hebrew word "shalom," meaning peace. This name is prophetic, as Solomon's reign is characterized by peace and prosperity, contrasting with the wars and conflicts of David's time. Solomon's name also reflects the peace that God has restored to David's household. Solomon is a type of Christ, as he is a king of peace and wisdom, prefiguring the ultimate peace and wisdom found in Jesus.<p><b>Now the LORD loved the child</b><br>This statement underscores God's favor and blessing upon Solomon, despite the circumstances of his conception. It highlights the theme of divine grace, where God chooses to love and bless individuals according to His purposes. This love is further evidenced by God's later promise to David that Solomon would build the temple and continue the Davidic line, which ultimately leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who had sinned with Bathsheba but repented.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, whom David took as his wife after orchestrating Uriah's death.

While we must not lay too great stress upon Solomon calling himself "a little child" (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) after his accession, yet it forbids our believing that he was more than just grown up, It was the remarkable ability of Solomon, his goodness and precocious talent, which made him so great a comfort to his parents, and which received Jehovah's seal of approval in the name <span class="accented">Jedidiah.</span> This name would scarcely be given him until his good and great qualities were developing; and as it was a sort of indication that he was the chosen and elect son of David, and therefore the next king, we shall probably be right in believing that this second mission of Nathan, and this mark of Divine favour to David's youngest child, did not take place until after Absalom's death, possibly not until Solomon was ten or twelve years of age.
