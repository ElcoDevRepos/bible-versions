His actions here reflect a strategic plan to win the favor of the people. By positioning himself at the city gate, a place of legal and civic activity, he intercepted those seeking justice from King David. This act of intercepting the Israelites highlights Absalom's ambition and cunning nature, as he sought to undermine his father's authority. The city gate was a significant location in ancient Israelite society, serving as a hub for legal matters and public discourse, making it an ideal place for Absalom to influence the people.<p><b>who came to the king for justice.</b><br>In ancient Israel, the king was the supreme judge, responsible for ensuring justice and fairness. People would come to the king with their grievances, seeking a resolution. Absalom's actions suggest a dissatisfaction among the people with the current administration, or at least a perception that justice was not being adequately served. By presenting himself as a more accessible and empathetic alternative, Absalom capitalized on any existing discontent. This reflects a broader biblical theme of leaders being held accountable for justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which emphasizes the importance of justice, mercy, and humility.<p><b>In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</b><br>The phrase "stole the hearts" indicates Absalom's success in winning the loyalty and affection of the people, effectively turning them away from King David. This act of winning over the people can be seen as a form of political seduction, where Absalom's charm and promises of better justice swayed public opinion. This narrative foreshadows the eventual rebellion led by Absalom against his father, a significant event in the history of Israel. The concept of "stealing hearts" also echoes the biblical theme of loyalty and allegiance, as seen in the relationship between God and His people, where God desires the hearts of His followers to be fully devoted to Him, as expressed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

Earlier we read that he &#8220;prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>), signaling open ambition. He rose early, stationed himself at the city gate, and personally intercepted petitioners (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>). Like the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1&#8211;5</a>, he mixed truth with manipulation, presenting himself as both accessible and sympathetic. The steady repetition of his scheme echoes <a href="/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>, where persistence wore down resistance. Scripture shows nothing accidental here&#8212;Absalom purposed to shift loyalty away from King David.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all the Israelites</b><p>The scope was nationwide. Verse 6 emphasizes &#8220;all,&#8221; reminding us how quickly influence can spread when left unchecked, much like the &#8220;little leaven&#8221; that leavens the whole lump (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>). His reach paralleled the earlier ministry of Samuel, who journeyed &#8220;from year to year&#8221; judging Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15-17</a>), but with an opposite motive. Absalom&#8217;s appeal crossed tribal lines; later, the uprising would include &#8220;all the men of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>), indicating that no region was immune to his charm offensive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who came to the king for justice</b><p>The people&#8217;s need was real. David had long been known for administering justice and righteousness (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>), yet age, palace intrigue, and the weight of governance may have created gaps. Absalom exploited those gaps, presenting himself as the solution: &#8220;If only someone would appoint me judge&#8230; then every man with a grievance could come to me, and I would give him justice&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>). The tension recalls <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>, where Solomon&#8217;s wisdom satisfied the people; here, by contrast, David&#8217;s perceived inaccessibility opened a door for counterfeit leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in this way he stole</b><p>&#8220;Stole&#8221; underscores deceit and illegitimacy. Nothing was earned; it was taken covertly, paralleling <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24-26</a>, where flattery conceals true intent. Absalom&#8217;s winsome words masked rebellion, akin to <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>: &#8220;smooth talk and flattery deceive the hearts of the na&#239;ve.&#8221; His embrace and kiss (<a href="/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5</a>) feigned affection while robbing loyalty from its rightful place. Scripture consistently warns against such theft of allegiance&#8212;<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a> records Korah doing something similar by stirring the congregation against Moses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the hearts of the men of Israel</b><p>Heart in Scripture speaks of the seat of will and affection (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). Absalom captured emotions first, knowing actions follow affection (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>). When messengers later shout, &#8220;Absalom is king in Hebron!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>), the people are ready because their hearts have already shifted. This mirrors Saul&#8217;s earlier favor: &#8220;All Israel and Judah loved David&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>), showing how swiftly hearts can turn when influence changes hands. Ultimately, misplaced affection led Israel into conflict and sorrow (<a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a> reveals the anatomy of subtle rebellion. Absalom consciously leveraged personal charm and apparent concern to siphon loyalty that rightly belonged to King David. By consistently engaging every Israelite seeking justice, he filled a leadership gap with counterfeit compassion and, through flattery, stole their hearts. The verse warns that ungodly ambition often flourishes under a veneer of empathy, and it calls believers to guard their hearts and loyalties, ensuring they remain fixed on God-ordained leaders and, above all, on the Lord Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom stole the hearts.</span> By professing anxiety to devote himself to the hearing and deciding of the people's causes, by flattering each one with the assurance that his case was so good that it needed only a hearing to be decided in his favour, and by his affability, made the more charming and irresistible by his personal beauty, he won the love of the people almost without their knowing how devoted they had become to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Absalom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">Absalom -- 'my father is peace', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
