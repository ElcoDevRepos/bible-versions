David's departure signifies a moment of humility and vulnerability, contrasting with his earlier triumphs. This event is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>, where God declared that calamity would arise from David's own house. David's departure from Jerusalem is also reminiscent of the Exodus, as he leaves the city with his followers, trusting in God's guidance.<p><b>and his entire household followed him.</b><br>David's household includes his family, servants, and loyal supporters. This demonstrates the loyalty and unity among those who remained faithful to him despite the political turmoil. The household's willingness to follow David into uncertainty reflects the strong leadership and personal relationships he had cultivated. This act of following the king can be seen as a type of Christ, where believers are called to follow Jesus, even in times of trial and uncertainty.<p><b>But he left behind ten concubines</b><br>Concubines in ancient Israel were women who lived with a man in a recognized relationship but without the full status of a wife. David leaving behind ten concubines indicates a strategic decision to maintain a semblance of royal presence and care for the palace. This action, however, later leads to a tragic fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy when Absalom publicly disgraces them (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21-22</a>), symbolizing the complete rupture within David's household.<p><b>to take care of the palace.</b><br>The concubines were left to manage the domestic affairs of the palace, ensuring its upkeep during David's absence. This decision highlights the practical aspects of governance and the need for continuity in royal duties, even amidst crisis. The palace, as the center of political power, required caretakers to maintain its operations. This situation underscores the vulnerability of David's kingdom during the rebellion and foreshadows the challenges he would face upon his return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who is forced to flee Jerusalem due to the rebellion led by his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son who has conspired to overthrow his father and take the throne of Israel, leading to David's departure from Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel and the location from which David departs.

David does not wait for events to overtake him; he moves decisively, trusting that God remains sovereign over the outcome (<a href="/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1-3</a> was composed &#8220;when he fled from Absalom&#8221;).<p>&#8226; His departure shows humility and faith. Rather than defend himself behind Jerusalem&#8217;s walls, he entrusts his safety and future to the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25-26</a>: &#8220;If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Application: Obedience sometimes means stepping away from what is comfortable or even ours by right, confident that God can restore what we relinquish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his entire household followed him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Household&#8221; includes wives, children, trusted officials, and bodyguards (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a> mentions Cherethites, Pelethites, and 600 Gittites).

What David thought routine turns into public disgrace, reminding us that sin&#8217;s consequences can surface long after forgiveness.<p>&#8226; Later, when David returns, these women live in seclusion for life (<a href="/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a>), demonstrating how others often bear collateral damage from a leader&#8217;s moral failure (compare <a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17-22</a> regarding Abishag).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to take care of the palace</b><p>&#8226; David expects to come back; he is stewarding God&#8217;s city, not abandoning it (<a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>). Leaving caretakers shows faith, not despair.<p>&#8226; Ironically, the palace becomes the stage for Absalom&#8217;s attempted legitimation of his coup, highlighting the tension between human plans and divine purposes (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical wisdom and spiritual trust pair naturally: David organizes what he can, then leaves outcomes with God (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a> models the same blend&#8212;&#8220;we prayed&#8230; and posted a guard&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Second Samuel 15:16 records more than a travel log.
