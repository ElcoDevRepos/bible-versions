His decision to confer with the elders signifies a pivotal moment in the transition of power from the house of Saul to David. The elders of Israel were leaders and representatives of the tribes, and their support was crucial for any king. This meeting indicates Abner's recognition of David's growing influence and the need for a unified Israel under a legitimate king. Historically, such councils were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where tribal leaders played significant roles in governance.<p><b>and said, &#8220;In the past you sought David as your king.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the previous desire of the Israelites to have David as their king, even during Saul's reign. David's reputation as a warrior and leader was well-established, especially after his victory over Goliath and his successes in battle. The people's earlier inclination towards David reflects the divine anointing he received through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). This moment also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as the tribes of Israel begin to recognize him as their rightful leader. The reference to past desires underscores the continuity of God's plan and the eventual establishment of David's kingdom, which is a type of the eternal kingdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army and a significant political figure in Israel.

After Saul&#8217;s death he propped up Ish-bosheth as a rival king to David, but that arrangement was fragile (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>). Here, the narrative pivots. The once-unyielding general recognizes God&#8217;s unfolding plan for David and begins to act on it. <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a> reminds us that while human plans shift, &#8220;the counsel of the LORD stands forever.&#8221; Abner&#8217;s change of heart highlights that truth:<p>&#8226; He moves from resisting David to facilitating David&#8217;s reign.<p>&#8226; He illustrates how even powerful leaders are ultimately subject to God&#8217;s sovereign agenda (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Conferred with the elders of Israel</b><p>The elders were tribal leaders who represented their people (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4</a>). Abner&#8217;s meeting signals a political and spiritual turning point:<p>&#8226; By consulting the elders, Abner acknowledges their authority and seeks a united decision (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His initiative nudges the northern tribes toward embracing the king God had already chosen (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; The gathering contrasts with earlier fragmentation under Saul&#8217;s house (<a href="/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a>).

He would probably not take so decided a step as the surrender of Michal without sounding the elders, that is, the local sheikhs, and finding out how far they were inclined to support David as king of all Israel. When everything was ready he would take Michal to Hebron, and so have the opportunity of arranging with David for future action; and though Ishbosheth would dislike the matter and suspect Abner of ulterior purposes, yet he could not refuse so specious a plea as the escorting of his sister. His previous failure, too, had taught him that Abner was master. We may further be sure that David had everywhere many adherents. All Israel knew that he was marked out by prophecy to be their king, and, moreover, "all Israel and Judah loved him" (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>). But when Abner says, <span class="cmt_word">Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you,</span> he makes it probable that, at some time after the defeat at Gilboa, the attempt had even been made to elect David king. But Abner had then opposed it, and his success in resisting the Philistines, and David's unfortunate entanglement with those inveterate enemies of Israel, had made the attempt fail. And now Abner's attempt was to be equally unsuccessful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Abner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_74.htm">Strong's 74: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abner -- 'my father is a lamp', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">conferred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
