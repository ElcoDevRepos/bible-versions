The mention of his lineage is significant, as it highlights the covenant between David and Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>). Despite Saul's pursuit of David, David honors his promise to Jonathan by showing kindness to his offspring. This act of kindness reflects the biblical principle of covenant faithfulness, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The historical context is important here, as it was common for new kings to eliminate the previous king's descendants to secure their throne, yet David acts contrary to this norm.<p><b>he fell facedown in reverence</b><br>Mephibosheth's act of falling facedown signifies deep respect and submission, a common cultural practice in the ancient Near East when approaching a king or someone of high status. This gesture indicates Mephibosheth's acknowledgment of David's authority and his own vulnerable position. It also reflects the humility expected of those who come before God, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). This act of reverence can be seen as a type of worship, pointing to the ultimate reverence due to Christ, the King of Kings.<p><b>Then David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth!&#8221;</b><br>David's direct address to Mephibosheth is significant, as it shows personal recognition and acceptance. By calling him by name, David affirms Mephibosheth's identity and worth, despite his physical disability and potential political threat. This personal acknowledgment mirrors God's intimate knowledge of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, where God calls His people by name. It also foreshadows the personal relationship believers have with Christ, who knows His sheep by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I am your servant,&#8221; he replied</b><br>Mephibosheth's response, "I am your servant," indicates his willingness to serve and submit to David's authority. This declaration of servitude is a common expression of loyalty and humility in the biblical narrative. It reflects the appropriate response of believers to God's grace and kindness, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices. Mephibosheth's reply also highlights the theme of servanthood, which is central to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

Years earlier, Jonathan had bound David to a covenant of steadfast love (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>), and David had sworn to remember Jonathan&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_samuel/20-42.htm">1 Samuel 20:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Though crippled from childhood (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), Mephibosheth obeys the summons (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-5</a>). His coming shows trust in David&#8217;s word, mirroring how sinners are drawn to the King because of covenant faithfulness rather than personal merit (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The royal court in Jerusalem would normally spell doom for a former rival&#8217;s descendant, yet David&#8217;s earlier question&#8212;&#8220;Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan&#8217;s sake?&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1</a>)&#8212;frames this encounter with grace, not judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he fell facedown in reverence</b><p>&#8226; Bowing low acknowledged David&#8217;s rightful authority, just as Abraham bowed before the LORD (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>) and Joseph&#8217;s brothers bowed before him (<a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>).<p>&#8226; For the lame prince, the posture is risky and vulnerable, but it demonstrates repentance and humility, the only fitting stance before the king (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His reverence anticipates the universal homage every knee will render before Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>), underscoring the literal kingship theme woven through Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David speaks the man&#8217;s name, signaling recognition and welcome. The shepherd-king knows his own, much like the Lord who calls His sheep by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The exclamation mark conveys affection, fulfilling Jonathan&#8217;s desire that David &#8220;show kindness to my descendants forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By initiating the conversation, David demonstrates that grace originates with the king, not the petitioner (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am your servant,&#8221; he replied</b><p>&#8226; Mephibosheth declares servant-hood, aligning himself with the king&#8217;s purposes, as Abigail once did before David (<a href="/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>).<p>&#8226; He does not assert rights tied to royal lineage; instead, he surrenders them. This mirrors the gospel call to deny self and follow Christ (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The confession prepares the way for David&#8217;s restoration of Saul&#8217;s land and a perpetual seat at the king&#8217;s table (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>), echoing how believers are seated with Christ in heavenly places (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a> reveals covenant grace in action. A disabled, once-hidden heir approaches the throne, prostrates himself, hears his name spoken in kindness, and pledges loyal service. The verse highlights David&#8217;s faithfulness to his promise, Mephibosheth&#8217;s humble response, and a vivid picture of how the greater Son of David welcomes us&#8212;drawing, accepting, and transforming those who come to Him in surrender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fell on his face.</span> Mephibosheth probably expected the fate which in the East usually befalls the members of a dethroned dynasty. Subsequently in Israel each new line of usurpers put to death every male relative of its predecessor, and it was with difficulty in Judah that one babe was rescued from the hands of its own grandmother, Athaliah, when she usurped the throne. Looked at, then, in the light of Oriental policy, David's conduct was most generous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when Mephibosheth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4648.htm">Strong's 4648: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mephibosheth -- 'dispeller of shame'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jonathan,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Saul,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
