The term "great salvation" refers to the numerous victories and deliverances David experienced throughout his life, often against overwhelming odds. This salvation is not just physical but also spiritual, as God establishes David's kingdom and lineage. The concept of God as a deliverer is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the Exodus narrative and the deliverance of Israel from various enemies. The "king" here is David, but it also foreshadows the ultimate King, Jesus Christ, who brings salvation to all humanity. The Davidic Covenant, found in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promises that David's throne will be established forever, pointing to the eternal reign of Christ.<p><b>He shows loving devotion to His anointed,</b><br>The term "anointed" refers to someone chosen and consecrated by God for a specific purpose. In the Old Testament, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed with oil as a sign of God's selection and empowerment. David was anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), signifying God's choice of him as king. The phrase "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness. This covenantal love is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's unwavering commitment to His people. The anointing of David prefigures the anointing of Jesus, the Messiah (meaning "Anointed One"), who fulfills the roles of prophet, priest, and king.<p><b>to David and his descendants forever.</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's promise to David. The Davidic Covenant assures that David's lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). This promise is significant in the biblical narrative, as it establishes the messianic hope that a descendant of David will reign eternally. The genealogies in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke trace Jesus' lineage back to David, affirming Him as the rightful heir to David's throne. The phrase "forever" emphasizes the perpetual nature of God's covenant, which is not limited by time or human failure. This eternal promise is a cornerstone of Christian eschatology, anticipating the second coming of Christ and His everlasting kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role as a warrior and psalmist.
