In ancient Israel, hair was often seen as a symbol of strength and vitality. Absalom's hair was a source of pride and a symbol of his attractiveness and charisma, which played a role in his influence over the people. The act of cutting his hair annually suggests a ritualistic or customary practice, possibly linked to vows or personal grooming habits of the time.<p><b>he shaved it every year because his hair got so heavy&#8212;</b><br>The annual shaving indicates a regular practice, possibly for comfort or practicality, as the weight of his hair became burdensome. This detail highlights the extraordinary nature of Absalom's hair, setting him apart from others. In the cultural context, long hair could be associated with the Nazirite vow, although there is no indication Absalom was a Nazirite. The emphasis on the heaviness of his hair underscores his physical allure and the attention he commanded, which later played into his political ambitions.<p><b>he would weigh it out to be two hundred shekels,</b><br>The weight of Absalom's hair, two hundred shekels, is significant, as it demonstrates the remarkable nature of his appearance. A shekel was a unit of weight, approximately 11 grams, making his hair weigh about 5.5 pounds. This detail serves to emphasize his unique physical attributes, which contributed to his popularity and influence. The act of weighing the hair could symbolize pride or a record of his personal attributes, reflecting the importance of physical appearance in leadership and social standing in ancient Israel.<p><b>according to the royal standard.</b><br>The mention of the "royal standard" suggests that the weight was measured using official or standardized weights, possibly those used in the royal court. This implies a level of formality and recognition of Absalom's status within the kingdom. The use of the royal standard could also indicate the importance of maintaining accurate measures in trade and official matters, reflecting the organized nature of David's administration. This detail connects Absalom to the royal family, highlighting his position and potential claim to the throne, which becomes a central theme in the narrative of his rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his striking appearance and long hair.

If it was the same with the shekel of the sanctuary, the weight mentioned would be about six pounds; if only half as much, the weight would still be very extraordinary. Some clerical error has probably arisen in copying the number in the MSS.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</span> Unless the royal shekel was smaller than the shekel of the sanctuary, the weight of Absalom's hair would be six pounds. But we cannot believe that the king's shekel was not full weight; for to imagine this is to suppose that the king had tampered with the coinage; for the shekel was a coin as well as a weight, being originally a fixed quantity of silver. As a matter of fact, David had amassed too much silver to have need of resorting to what is the expedient of feeble and impoverished princes. Nor can we grant an error in the number; for the versions all agree with the Hebrew, so that any mistake must, at all events, be of great antiquity. Josephus says that Solomon's body guard wore long hair powdered with gold dust, and undoubtedly Absalom's hair was something extraordinary (<a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>). But six pounds is so enormous a weight that it is just possible that some ancient copyist has enlarged the number, to make it accord with a legend current among the people, in which this feature of Absalom's beauty had been exaggerated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when he cut the hair</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
