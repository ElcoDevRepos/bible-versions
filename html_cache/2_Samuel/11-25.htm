This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where communication often occurred through intermediaries. The use of a messenger also indicates the distance between David and Joab, who was on the battlefield.<p><b>Say this to Joab</b><br>Joab was the commander of David's army and a key military leader. His role was crucial in executing David's military strategies. The direct communication from David to Joab underscores the importance of the message and the trust David placed in Joab's leadership.<p><b>Do not let this matter upset you</b><br>David is attempting to console Joab after the death of Uriah, Bathsheba's husband. This phrase reveals David's attempt to downplay the gravity of the situation, which he orchestrated to cover his sin with Bathsheba. It highlights the moral and ethical decline in David's actions, contrasting with his earlier righteousness.<p><b>for the sword devours one as well as another</b><br>This phrase reflects the harsh realities of war, where death is indiscriminate. It echoes the fatalistic view of battle common in ancient times, where outcomes were often attributed to fate or divine will. This statement can be seen as an attempt by David to rationalize the death of Uriah as a casualty of war rather than a result of his own machinations.<p><b>Strengthen your attack against the city and demolish it</b><br>David instructs Joab to continue the siege against Rabbah, the Ammonite capital. This command shows David's focus on military objectives despite personal failings. The historical context involves ongoing conflicts between Israel and neighboring nations, with territorial expansion and control being key goals.<p><b>Encourage him with these words</b><br>David seeks to bolster Joab's morale, recognizing the importance of leadership and motivation in achieving military success. This reflects the cultural value placed on courage and perseverance in the face of adversity. The encouragement also serves to maintain Joab's loyalty and focus on the task at hand, despite the underlying deceit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who orchestrates the death of Uriah to cover up his sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who is instructed by David to place Uriah in harm's way.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, who is killed in battle due to David's orders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, with whom David commits adultery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The military conflict where Uriah is deliberately placed in a dangerous position to ensure his death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often leads to further sin.

<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The messenger becomes a tool in David&#8217;s attempt to cover wrongdoing&#8212;an early sign that secrecy, not repentance, is guiding his heart (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Say this to Joab</b><p>&#8226;

both men now share responsibility (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; It also shows how leadership can misuse authority, reminding us that true leadership serves righteousness (<a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not let this matter upset you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;This matter&#8221; is the calculated killing of a loyal soldier (<a href="/2_samuel/11-17.htm">2 Samuel 11:17</a>).<p>&#8226; David downplays sin, counseling Joab to suppress any pangs of conscience&#8212;an echo of <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where evil is called good to dull conviction.<p>&#8226; Such minimization warns us how sin desensitizes the heart (<a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the sword devours one as well as another</b><p>&#8226;

Each phrase exposes a heart bent on concealment: reshaping the story, minimizing guilt, cloaking murder in wartime inevitability, and inspiring Joab to continue the siege. The verse warns how sin distorts leadership, dulls moral sensitivity, and values success over righteousness&#8212;lessons underscored when God later sends Nathan to bring David to repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">One as well as another.</span>--While David's reply to Joab is ostensibly to encourage him, on the ground that the mishap was a mere accident of war, it is yet couched in such language as to imply a special regret for the loss of Uriah.

As for Uriah's death, of course it is to be regretted, but such is the fortune of war, and the sword devours now one and now another. The last words, <span class="cmt_word">encourage thou him,</span> have provoked comment, as though the messenger was to aid and abet Joab. They simply mean "Give him a message of encouragement from me," the exact form of which is left to the messenger, but of which his report would be that the king wished Joab to take courage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1436;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
