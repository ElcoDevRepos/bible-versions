In ancient Israel, bowing was a common gesture of honor and deference, often used in the presence of royalty or nobility. Absalom, the son of King David, was positioning himself as a figure of authority and influence, subtly undermining his father's rule. This act of bowing also reflects the hierarchical nature of society at the time, where social status and power dynamics were visibly demonstrated through physical gestures.<p><b>Absalom would reach out his hand,</b><br>Absalom's action of reaching out his hand signifies a deliberate and calculated move to connect with the people on a personal level. By extending his hand, Absalom breaks the traditional barrier between royalty and commoners, presenting himself as approachable and relatable. This gesture can be seen as a political strategy to win the hearts of the Israelites, contrasting with the more distant and formal demeanor expected of a king. It reflects Absalom's ambition and his desire to gain favor among the people, setting the stage for his eventual rebellion against David.<p><b>take hold of him,</b><br>Taking hold of someone in this context implies a sense of familiarity and intimacy. Absalom's action is not just a casual handshake but a deliberate attempt to establish a personal connection. This physical contact would have been unexpected from someone of royal lineage, further endearing him to the people. It demonstrates Absalom's cunning nature, as he uses charm and charisma to manipulate public perception and gather support for his cause. This act of taking hold can also be seen as a metaphor for Absalom's attempt to seize control and influence over the kingdom.<p><b>and kiss him.</b><br>The kiss in ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of respect, loyalty, and affection. By kissing those who approached him, Absalom was not only showing acceptance but also creating a bond of loyalty. This act of kissing can be seen as a political maneuver to win the allegiance of the people, as it was a gesture that conveyed trust and solidarity. In a broader biblical context, the kiss can be contrasted with the betrayal of Judas in the New Testament, where a kiss is used as a sign of treachery. Absalom's kiss, while seemingly genuine, is ultimately self-serving, as it is part of his larger scheme to usurp his father's throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

Compare Moses hearing &#8220;all the people&#8221; in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13&#8211;16</a>, but note that Moses directed them toward God, while Absalom redirected them toward himself.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the open accessibility Absalom offered, a stark contrast to King David&#8217;s limited availability (<a href="/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>). His availability was not servanthood but strategy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bow down to him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to bow down to him&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; In Israel, bowing conveyed honor toward one in authority (<a href="/1_samuel/25-23.htm">1 Samuel 25:23</a>; <a href="/esther/3-2.htm">Esther 3:2</a>). Absalom expected, and apparently welcomed, royal homage&#8212;already acting the part of king though his father still reigned.<p>&#8226; This physical act exposed the deeper heart issue: Absalom coveted worship-like allegiance that belonged to the Lord-appointed king (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His lust for homage mirrors the temptation Satan offered Jesus&#8212;authority without the cross (<a href="/luke/4-6.htm">Luke 4:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Absalom would reach out his hand</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Absalom would reach out his hand&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Instead of receiving the bow, he initiated contact. A hand extended suggests equality and friendship (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>), but here it was flattery masked as fellowship (<a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture disarmed people psychologically: it annulled the social distance that normally preserved reverence for the throne, shifting loyalty from David to Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Such counterfeit humility foreshadows false teachers who &#8220;creep in unnoticed&#8221; (<a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>), winning confidence before revealing corruption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>take hold of him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;take hold of him&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s grip ensured the encounter could not remain formal. The one who came to bow became the one held in Absalom&#8217;s grasp&#8212;symbolically and soon politically.<p>&#8226; This physical seizing pictures the way sin entices and then ensnares (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). Absalom&#8217;s ambition first appealed to wounded citizens, then bound them to his cause.<p>&#8226; David once &#8220;took hold&#8221; of a lion and bear to protect sheep (<a href="/1_samuel/17-35.htm">1 Samuel 17:35</a>); Absalom took hold of people to exploit them. Same action, opposite heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and kiss him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and kiss him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A kiss in the Ancient Near East sealed covenant loyalty (<a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). Absalom co-opted this intimate sign to fabricate brotherhood.<p>&#8226; The tactic anticipates Judas, who also betrayed with a kiss (<a href="/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48&#8211;49</a>). Both men weaponized affection to mask rebellion against the anointed king.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> reminds us, &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.&#8221; Absalom&#8217;s kisses illustrate that warning vividly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every movement in <a href="/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5</a> captures a calculated performance. Absalom made himself approachable, redirected homage, offered an equalizing handshake, seized control, and sealed the moment with a kiss&#8212;all to steal hearts from God&#8217;s chosen king (v. 6). The verse warns us to discern flattery, to prize loyalty to God-ordained authority, and to recognize that outward warmth can cloak inner rebellion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Also, when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
