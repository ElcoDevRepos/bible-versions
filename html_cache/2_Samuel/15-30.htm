It is a place of worship and prophecy, later becoming the site of Jesus' ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>). David's ascent here symbolizes a retreat and a moment of deep personal anguish. The Mount of Olives is often associated with prayer and lamentation, as seen in Jesus' own prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-46</a>).<p><b>weeping as he went up</b><br>David's weeping reflects his sorrow over the rebellion of his son Absalom and the betrayal by his people. This moment of lamentation is reminiscent of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>). It highlights the human experience of grief and the consequences of sin, both personal and communal.<p><b>His head was covered</b><br>Covering the head is a traditional sign of mourning and shame in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It signifies David's humility and repentance, acknowledging his own failures as a father and king. This act of covering the head is also seen in other biblical contexts as a sign of deep distress (<a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>).<p><b>and he was walking barefoot</b><br>Walking barefoot is another expression of mourning and humility. It indicates a state of vulnerability and penitence. In biblical times, going barefoot was often associated with mourning or a sign of submission to God's will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>.<p><b>And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went</b><br>The collective mourning of David's followers underscores the gravity of the situation and their loyalty to him despite the circumstances. It reflects the communal nature of grief and the shared burden of leadership.

Every detail&#8212;location, tears, covered heads, unshod feet&#8212;signals humility, repentance, and dependence on God. The scene foreshadows Christ&#8217;s own ascent of the same mount, bearing sorrow yet trusting the Father&#8217;s plan. For believers, David&#8217;s trek teaches that in moments of loss we move toward God, embrace humility, share one another&#8217;s burdens, and wait for the Lord who lifts the lowly and restores what seems lost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ascent of mount Olivet;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the ascent of the olive trees.</span> The hill never was called Olivet, which is a word formed from the Latin <span class="accented">mons oliveti</span>, the mount of the olive grove. <span class="cmt_word">David had his head covered.</span> This was a sign of grief among the Persians, Egyptians, and Romans, as well as the Hebrews (for whom see <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), it being originally a natural movement to conceal an outburst of tears. So we in great sorrow bury our faces in our hands. In this mark of mourning all joined, but David added the going barefoot as a sign of deeper humiliation. According to the Jewish Midrash, it was upon the Mount of Olives that David composed the third psalm. More probably it was at the fords of the Jordan, after David, wearied with the fatigues of the march, had enjoyed a short refreshing slumber, and while he was waiting for his two young friends, that he comforted himself by this outpouring of his heart to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1441;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
