In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, David is singing a song of deliverance, celebrating God's faithfulness and his own commitment to God's ways. The term "blameless" does not imply sinlessness but rather a wholehearted devotion to God, aligning with the Hebrew concept of "tamim," which denotes completeness or integrity. This echoes <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, where God commands Abraham to walk before Him and be blameless. David's claim of blamelessness is also seen in <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, a parallel passage, emphasizing his sincere efforts to follow God's commandments. This integrity is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate blameless one, fulfilling the law perfectly (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>and kept myself from iniquity</b><br>David's statement here highlights his active role in avoiding sin and maintaining purity. The Hebrew word for "iniquity" often refers to moral perversity or wrongdoing. David's commitment to keeping himself from iniquity is a testament to his desire to live a life pleasing to God, despite his well-documented failures, such as the incident with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11). This phrase underscores the biblical principle of personal responsibility in pursuing holiness, as seen in <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, which calls believers to keep themselves unstained by the world. David's efforts to avoid iniquity also prefigure the sinless life of Jesus Christ, who, though tempted in every way, was without sin (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on his life and relationship with God. He is acknowledging his efforts to live righteously.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom David is speaking. David attributes his ability to remain blameless to his relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David was king. His leadership and personal integrity were crucial for the spiritual and moral direction of the nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>Throughout his life, David faced numerous adversaries, including Saul and foreign nations.
