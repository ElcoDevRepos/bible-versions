The "house of Saul" refers to the remaining supporters and family of Saul, who was the first king of Israel. The "house of David" refers to David and his followers, who were anointed by God to succeed Saul. This period of civil war is significant as it highlights the transition of power from Saul to David, a key moment in Israel's history. The conflict is rooted in the divine rejection of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>) and the anointing of David as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). This war is not just a political struggle but also a fulfillment of God's plan for Israel.<p><b>Abner had continued to strengthen his position in the house of Saul</b><br>Abner, the son of Ner, was Saul's cousin and the commander of his army (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>). His role was crucial in maintaining the house of Saul's influence during the power struggle. By strengthening his position, Abner was consolidating power, possibly to ensure his own influence and survival in the shifting political landscape. This action reflects the common practice of military leaders in ancient times to secure their standing through strategic alliances and displays of strength. Abner's actions can be seen as both a political maneuver and a personal ambition, as he later seeks to negotiate with David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-12.htm">2 Samuel 3:12-21</a>). This move by Abner also foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David, as Abner's defection to David's side becomes a pivotal moment in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, a powerful and influential figure in the house of Saul.

This verse places <a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6</a> in an extended season of conflict that began after Saul&#8217;s death (<a href="/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>) and Ish-bosheth&#8217;s elevation by Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The conflict is not a single battle but a drawn-out struggle, much like the earlier, long-running hostilities between Israel and the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already declared that David would reign (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 12</a>&#8211;13), yet David waited on the Lord rather than forcing the outcome (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The long war serves God&#8217;s larger purpose: displaying David&#8217;s patience and proving the weakness of Saul&#8217;s dynasty apart from the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1, 10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>between the house of Saul and the house of David</b><p>The word &#8220;house&#8221; speaks of a royal household&#8212;administration, loyal tribes, and military forces.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s &#8220;house&#8221; centers in Mahanaim east of the Jordan (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8&#8211;9</a>), held together by Abner&#8217;s skill more than by Ish-bosheth&#8217;s charisma (<a href="/2_samuel/3-11.htm">2 Samuel 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s &#8220;house&#8221; rules from Hebron in Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4, 11</a>).

The phrase points to calculated consolidation:<p>&#8226; Political moves: Abner commands the army, controls access to the king, and likely manages alliances (<a href="/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal leverage: taking Saul&#8217;s concubine Rizpah (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>) is a bid for royal legitimacy&#8212;similar to Absalom&#8217;s later act (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Growing influence: elders of Israel listen to him (<a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>), indicating his sway has outgrown Ish-bosheth&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Spiritual backdrop: every step Abner takes to prop up Saul&#8217;s fading house runs against the Lord&#8217;s declared plan for David, yet God sovereignly uses even Abner&#8217;s self-interest to advance that plan (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6</a> highlights Abner&#8217;s steady effort to buttress Saul&#8217;s fragile dynasty during a drawn-out civil war. While David waits on God&#8217;s timing, Abner maneuvers politically and militarily to keep power&#8212;going so far as to eclipse Ish-bosheth himself. The verse underscores the contrast between human self-promotion and God&#8217;s sure promise to establish David&#8217;s throne, reminding us that no amount of earthly strategizing can overturn the Lord&#8217;s sovereign purposes (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Abner made himself strong.</span>--It has already been noticed that the fortunes of the house of Saul depended entirely upon Abner, but the fact of Ish-bosheth's great obligation to him is again mentioned here in explanation of the following story.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</span> The Hebrew really means that until this miserable quarrel about Rizpah, Abner had been the mainstay of Ishbosheth's throne and dynasty. She is proved to have been a noble woman, with a warm and devoted heart, by the narrative in <a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8-11</a>. But the harem of a deceased king was looked upon as the special inheritance of his successor; and Absalom, by taking David's concubines (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21, 22</a>), treated his father as a dead man, and committed so overt an act of treason as made reconciliation impossible. So Solomon put his brother Adonijah to death for asking Abishag to wife (<a href="/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23-25</a>). Still, as Bathsheba there saw no impropriety in Adonijah's request, and as Solomon deposed Abiathar and put Joab to death for complicity, as we must conclude, in Adonijah's request, it was probably part of some scheme of conspiracy, and that, if granted, it would have been used by Adonijah as a proof that the kingdom really was his. Here there was no plot, and as Rizpah had probably always lived apart from Ishbosheth, Abner may have expected that the king would see no difficulty in the matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now during</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
