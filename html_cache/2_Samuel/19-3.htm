The context is the return of David's troops after the death of his son Absalom, who had led a rebellion against him. The city referred to is likely Mahanaim, where David had taken refuge during Absalom's revolt. The quiet return indicates a subdued and somber mood among the troops, reflecting the tension between their victory in battle and the king's personal grief. This moment highlights the complex dynamics of leadership and the personal cost of political conflict. The quiet return contrasts with the typical celebration of victory, emphasizing the unique circumstances of this situation.<p><b>as people steal away in humiliation</b><br>The imagery of stealing away in humiliation suggests a sense of shame or disgrace. This reflects the soldiers' awareness of David's sorrow over Absalom's death, which overshadowed their military success. In ancient Near Eastern culture, honor and shame were significant social values, and the soldiers' demeanor indicates their sensitivity to the king's emotional state. This phrase also underscores the tension between public duty and private grief, a recurring theme in David's life. The soldiers' behavior can be seen as an act of respect for their king, acknowledging his pain and the complex nature of their victory.<p><b>after fleeing a battle</b><br>This part of the verse draws a parallel between the soldiers' quiet return and the actions of those who flee from battle. In biblical times, fleeing from battle was often associated with defeat and disgrace. However, in this context, the soldiers had not fled but had been victorious. The comparison highlights the irony of their situation: despite their success, they felt as if they had been defeated because of the king's mourning. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the cost of sin and rebellion, as Absalom's revolt brought sorrow and division to David's kingdom. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the consequences of conflict and the importance of reconciliation and restoration, themes that resonate throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of his son Absalom, despite Absalom's rebellion against him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who led a rebellion against his father, resulting in a civil war within Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander, who played a crucial role in quelling Absalom's rebellion and later rebuked David for his excessive mourning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Mahanaim, where David had taken refuge during Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between David's forces and those loyal to Absalom, culminating in Absalom's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_grief.htm">The Complexity of Grief</a></b><br>David's mourning for Absalom, despite his son's rebellion, illustrates the complex nature of grief.

God has granted victory, yet celebration is conspicuously absent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the city</b><p>The city is Mahanaim, David&#8217;s temporary capital while Jerusalem was under rebel control (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24, 27</a>). Expecting a hero&#8217;s welcome, the troops instead meet an uneasy hush&#8212;foreshadowing the bittersweet river crossing that will soon return David to Jerusalem (19:39&#8211;40).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>quietly that day</b><p>&#8220;That day&#8221; links the silence to the very day of triumph. Verse 2 already told us, &#8220;That day the victory was turned to mourning for all the people, because they heard, &#8216;The king is grieving over his son&#8217; &#8221;. Like the restraint urged in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>, the men sense that jubilation would worsen their leader&#8217;s pain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as people steal away in humiliation</b><p>Winners slink home like losers. Their shame mirrors Israel&#8217;s routed troops after Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>). <a href="/proverbs/25-20.htm">Proverbs 25:20</a> warns against singing songs to a heavy heart; these soldiers instinctively obey, muting their victory for David&#8217;s sake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after fleeing a battle</b><p>The image evokes fugitives sneaking back after defeat (<a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>). Ironically, the conquering army acts like the vanquished because the king&#8217;s sorrow redefines the day. Joab will soon rebuke David for endangering morale (<a href="/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5&#8211;7</a>), but for now the people embody the truth that leadership&#8217;s emotions shape a nation&#8217;s mood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/19-3.htm">2 Samuel 19:3</a> shows triumph eclipsed by grief. David&#8217;s loyal troops, though victorious, creep into Mahanaim as if beaten, because the king&#8217;s mourning over Absalom overshadows their success. The verse reminds us that the heart of a leader can turn a day of victory into one of silent shame, and that genuine unity requires shared joy as well as shared struggle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
