His father, Jehoiada, was a priest, indicating Benaiah's noble lineage and possible Levitical connections. This background may have influenced his strong sense of duty and faithfulness, traits highly valued in Israelite society.<p><b>was a man of valor from Kabzeel</b><br>Kabzeel was a town in the southern part of Judah, near the border with Edom. It was a region known for its rugged terrain and challenging living conditions, which may have contributed to Benaiah's development as a warrior. Being described as a "man of valor" highlights his courage and skill in battle, qualities that were essential for leaders in ancient Israel.<p><b>a man of many exploits</b><br>Benaiah's numerous achievements in battle set him apart as one of David's mighty men. His exploits would have been well-known and celebrated among the Israelites, serving as a testament to his strength and God's favor upon him. This phrase underscores the importance of military prowess in establishing one's reputation and legacy in the biblical narrative.<p><b>He struck down two champions of Moab</b><br>The Moabites were frequent adversaries of Israel, and defeating their champions would have been a significant military accomplishment. This act not only demonstrated Benaiah's personal bravery but also contributed to the security and stability of Israel. It reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighbors, a common theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion</b><br>This remarkable feat highlights Benaiah's fearlessness and resourcefulness. Snowfall in Israel is rare, suggesting that the conditions were particularly challenging. Lions were considered dangerous predators, and killing one would have been seen as an act of divine empowerment. This event can be seen as a type of Christ, who conquers sin and death, often symbolized by a lion in biblical literature.

Jehoiada was a priest (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>), so Benaiah grew up surrounded by worship and covenant truth. His godly heritage helps explain his unwavering courage when facing danger&#8212;just as Timothy&#8217;s faith was stirred by his mother and grandmother (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). Scripture shows again that family influence can anchor a warrior&#8217;s heart in the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was a man of valor</b><p>&#8220;Valor&#8221; in Scripture always ties to faith, not bravado.

Gideon was called a &#8220;mighty man of valor&#8221; while hiding (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>), proving that God names us by His purpose rather than our circumstances. Benaiah&#8217;s valor reflects trust in the Lord&#8217;s presence, which emboldens any believer to stand firm (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Kabzeel</b><p>Kabzeel sat on Judah&#8217;s southern frontier near hostile territories (<a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>).

Like David&#8217;s early life among dangerous Philistine lines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34&#8211;36</a>), Benaiah&#8217;s hometown fostered resilience and readiness for conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a man of many exploits</b><p>Scripture celebrates deeds done for God&#8217;s glory, not self-promotion. <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> parades saints who &#8220;through faith conquered kingdoms&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>).

This mirrors David running toward Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>) and Daniel facing lions in faith (<a href="/daniel/6-23.htm">Daniel 6:23</a>). The episode teaches:<p>&#8226; Faith acts decisively even when conditions worsen.<p>&#8226; True courage moves toward threats that imperil others.<p>&#8226; Victory in hidden places&#8212;&#8220;in a pit&#8221;&#8212;matters to God as much as battlefield triumphs (<a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord can enable His servants to overcome what seems humanly impossible (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Benaiah&#8217;s brief biography shines as a portrait of Spirit-empowered bravery rooted in covenant faith. Raised in a priestly home on a hostile border, he consistently chose bold obedience&#8212;whether facing foreign champions or a lion in a snow-filled pit. His story invites believers to trust God&#8217;s presence, step forward despite adverse conditions, and believe that no enemy&#8212;physical or spiritual&#8212;outmatches the Lord who equips His people for victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Benaiah.</span>--He was the general of the third division of the army (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-5.htm" title="The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:5-6</a>).

The meaning of the description given of him there is disputed; but probably it should be translated, "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest, as head," that is, of the brigade. He was thus the son of the Jehoiada who was leader of the house of Aaron, and whose coming to Hebron with three thousand seven hundred martial priests did so much to make David king of all Israel (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>). Subsequently he took the side of Solomon against Adonijah, and was rewarded by being made commander-in-chief, in place of Joab (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Kabzeel</span>.

"Ariel" means "lion of God," and is a name given to Jerusalem in <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1, 2</a>. The Syriac supports the Authorized Version in understanding by the term "heroes," or "champions;" but the use of poetical language in a prosaic catalogue is so strange that the Septuagint is probably right. If so, Ariel is the proper name of the King of Moab and the achievement took place in the war recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A lion.</span> This achievement would be as gratefully remembered as the killing of a man eating tiger by the natives in India. A lion, driven by the cold from the forests, had made its lair in a dry tank near some town, and thence preyed upon the inhabitants as they went in and out of the city. And Benaiah had pity upon them, and came to the rescue, and went down into the pit, and, at the risk of his life, slew the lion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Benaiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
