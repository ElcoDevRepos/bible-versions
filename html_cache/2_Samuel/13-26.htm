His name means "father of peace," which is ironic given his later actions. This phrase indicates Absalom's persistence and determination. In the broader narrative, Absalom is plotting revenge against his half-brother Amnon for the rape of their sister Tamar, which occurred earlier in the chapter. This reflects the deep-seated family tensions and the consequences of David's own moral failings.<p><b>"please let my brother Amnon go with us."</b><br>Absalom's request is strategic. He refers to Amnon as "my brother," which on the surface appears to be a gesture of familial unity, but it masks his true intentions of vengeance. The request to have Amnon accompany them to the sheep-shearing festival, a time of celebration and feasting, is a calculated move. Sheep-shearing was a significant event in ancient Israel, often associated with festivities and gatherings, as seen in <a href="/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12-13</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2-8</a>. Absalom's invitation is a setup for Amnon's murder, highlighting the theme of deception and betrayal.<p><b>"Why should he go with you?" the king asked.</b><br>King David's response shows his suspicion or concern. David, as a father and king, is caught in a web of family dysfunction and political intrigue. His question may reflect an awareness of the tension between his sons, yet he ultimately fails to prevent the tragedy. This moment underscores David's passive leadership and the unraveling of his household, a consequence of his own past sins, particularly his affair with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah, as prophesied by Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>.
