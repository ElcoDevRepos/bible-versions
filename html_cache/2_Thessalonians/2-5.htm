In the context of the early church, oral tradition and memory were crucial for preserving apostolic teachings. The Thessalonians were expected to remember Paul's instructions, highlighting the importance of retaining doctrinal truths. This echoes the biblical theme of remembrance found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are urged to remember God's commandments.<p><b>that I told you these things</b><br>Paul refers to specific teachings he had previously communicated to the Thessalonians. This likely includes eschatological teachings about the end times, the coming of the "man of lawlessness," and the return of Christ, as outlined earlier in the chapter. The phrase underscores the apostolic authority of Paul's teachings, which were foundational for the early church's understanding of prophecy and the future. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where prophets and apostles convey God's revelations, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>while I was still with you?</b><br>This indicates that Paul had personally visited the Thessalonian church and taught them directly. The historical context reveals that Paul founded the church in Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, as recorded in <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17:1-9</a>. His physical presence and direct teaching would have been a significant source of encouragement and instruction for the new believers. The phrase also highlights the transient nature of Paul's missionary work, as he often moved from city to city, leaving behind established churches to continue the work of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is reminding the Thessalonian church of his previous teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in Thessalonica who were facing confusion and persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachings.htm">False Teachings</a></b><br>The context of the letter involves addressing misunderstandings and false teachings about the return of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>A significant event in Christian eschatology that Paul discusses in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_restrainer.htm">The Restrainer</a></b><br>A mysterious figure or force mentioned in the surrounding verses, which Paul had previously explained to the Thessalonians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the need to remember his teachings, highlighting the importance of grounding oneself in sound doctrine.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_deception.htm">Guarding Against Deception</a></b><br>The Thessalonians were susceptible to false teachings.

The doctrine of Antichrist would naturally form part of the course on resurrection and judgment. This explains how the doctrine was enforced (1) so early in the education of the Christian churches: "while I was yet with you" (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to the First Epistle to Thessalonians</span>); and (2) so emphatically and repeatedly:" my habit was to tell you these things"--for the word translated "told" is in the imperfect tense, which means more than a single action. Notice that in St. Paul's eager personal recollection, of thus teaching, he for once (and nowhere else) forgets Silas and Timothy: not "we," but "I." Imagine a forger who should forge with such subtlety! Mark also how erroneous is the opinion that St. Paul in this Epistle recedes from his former teaching about the Advent and its date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</span> These words contain a reproach.
