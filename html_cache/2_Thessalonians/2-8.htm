The revealing of the lawless one is a key event in eschatological prophecy, indicating a time of great tribulation and apostasy. This aligns with other biblical references to the Antichrist, such as in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, where a figure arises to deceive and lead many astray. The term "revealed" suggests a divine allowance for this figure to be made known, indicating God's sovereign control over end-time events.<p><b>whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the power and authority of Jesus Christ. The imagery of slaying with the "breath of His mouth" is symbolic of the effortless and divine power of Christ's word, reminiscent of the creative power of God's word in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. It also connects to <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where the Messiah judges the wicked with the breath of His lips. This demonstrates that Christ's victory over evil is not through human means but through His divine authority and righteousness.<p><b>and annihilate by the majesty of His arrival</b><br>The term "annihilate" indicates a complete and final destruction, underscoring the totality of Christ's victory over evil. The "majesty of His arrival" refers to the Second Coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This event is described in various scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ returns in glory and power.

Jesus warned of this dramatic disclosure: &#8220;Then if anyone says to you, &#8216;Look, here is the Christ,&#8217; &#8230; do not believe it&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-23.htm">Matthew 24:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, recognizing this enemy is not cause for panic.

The publication of the "secret of rebelliousness" will be effected by the manifesto of the Rebel-in-chief. Of course, this Rebel is the same person with the Man of Sin, the change of title being due to the particularising of his sin by the word "lawlessness" in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>; the specification of the <span class= "ital">time</span> is the only additional intelligence; all the emphasis of the sentence, therefore, rests on "And <span class= "ital">then."</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>--The best text adds the name Jesus, which serves more clearly to contrast Him with His rival. The word "whom" might be more pointedly paraphrased by "and him."<p><span class= "bld">With the spirit of his mouth.</span>--St. Paul is quoting roughly from <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a> (comp. <a href="/job/4-9.htm" title="By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.">Job 4:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm" title="Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/11-20.htm" title="Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with one blast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight.">Wisdom Of Solomon 11:20</a> : "might have fallen down with one blast, . . . scattered abroad through the breath of Thy power"); and therefore we are to understand it to signify the perfect ease with which Christ will destroy Antichrist. Even when the phrase is used of speech (as it may perhaps be here), the absence of labour is the point to be noticed (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then;</span> namely, so soon as he that restraineth is taken out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">Shall that Wicked;</span> or, <span class="accented">that lawless one</span>, in whom the mystery of lawlessness is realized; not different from, but the same with, the "man of sin, the son of perdition." <span class="cmt_word">Be revealed;</span> appear unveiled in all his naked deformity. No longer working secretly, but openly, and in an undisguised form; no longer the mystery, but the revelation of lawlessness. The apostle now interrupts his description of the man of sin by announcing his doom. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord;</span> or, as the best attested manuscripts read, <span class="accented">whom the Lord Jesus.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall consume;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">shall slay</span> (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">With the spirit</span> (or, <span class="accented">breath</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his mouth.</span> Various interpretations have been given to this clause. Some refer it to the Word of God, and others to the Holy Spirit, and suppose that the conversion of the world is here predicted; but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation, as the doom of antichrist is here announced. Others refer the term to a cry or word, and think that the sentence of condemnation pronounced by the Lord Jesus on the wicked is intended. But the words are to be taken literally as a description of the power and irresistible might of Christ at his coming - that the mere breath of his mouth is sufficient to consume the wicked (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall destroy</span> (or, <span class="accented">annihilate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the brightness</span> (or, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his coming.</span> The two words, <span class="accented">epiphany</span> and <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which are elsewhere used separately to denote the coming of Christ, are here employed. There is no ground for the assertion that the first is the subjective and the second the objective aspect of Christ's coming (Olshausen). The brightness of Christ's coming is not here expressed; but the meaning is that the mere appearance of Christ's presence will annihilate the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
