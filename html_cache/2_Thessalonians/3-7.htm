Paul appeals to their firsthand awareness, suggesting that his conduct and that of his companions were evident and observable. This personal witness is crucial in establishing credibility and authority. In the early church, personal testimony and example were vital for teaching and reinforcing Christian behavior, as seen in <a href="/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18</a>, where Paul reminds the Ephesian elders of his conduct among them.<p><b>how you ought to imitate us</b><br>Imitation is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, where he often encourages believers to follow his example as he follows Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>). This concept of imitation is rooted in the Jewish tradition of discipleship, where a disciple would closely follow the rabbi's teachings and lifestyle. In the Greco-Roman world, philosophers also encouraged imitation of virtuous lives. Paul sets himself and his companions as models of Christian living, emphasizing the importance of living out the teachings of Christ in practical ways.<p><b>because we were not undisciplined among you</b><br>Paul contrasts his disciplined behavior with the disorderly conduct he warns against. The term "undisciplined" refers to a lack of order or responsibility, often associated with idleness or disruptive behavior. In the context of Thessalonica, a bustling city in Macedonia, maintaining discipline was essential for the church's witness and unity. Paul's disciplined lifestyle served as a corrective to those who were idle, as he later addresses in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a>. This discipline reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of diligence and stewardship (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and instruction to the early church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas_and_timothy.htm">Silas and Timothy</a></b><br>- Co-authors of the letter with Paul, who also served as examples to the Thessalonian believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>- A city in Macedonia where the church was established and to whom this letter was addressed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a community of believers facing challenges and needing encouragement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idleness.htm">Idleness</a></b><br>- A behavior Paul addresses, urging believers to follow the example of diligence and hard work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/imitation_of_godly_examples.htm">Imitation of Godly Examples</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to observe and imitate the behavior of mature Christians who exemplify Christ-like living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_idleness.htm">The Dangers of Idleness</a></b><br>Idleness can lead to spiritual stagnation and is discouraged.

This appeal to personal memory strengthens the point: the truth has been lived out right before their eyes. They saw it. They can verify it. (See <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, &#8220;You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless our conduct was toward you &#8230;&#8221;; <a href="/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18</a>.) Their knowledge removes any excuse for doubting the standard he is about to highlight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how you ought to imitate us</b><p>Imitation is a normal part of Christian discipleship. Paul is saying, &#8220;Copy what you saw.&#8221; The pattern he set is not optional; it is the expected path for every follower of Christ. &#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a> declares, &#8220;You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ&#8221;. &#8226; <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a> urges believers to &#8220;follow my example&#8221; and keep eyes on those walking the same way. &#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a> commends these very believers for becoming &#8220;imitators of us and of the Lord.&#8221; By calling for imitation, Paul links practical daily life with faith, showing that belief must translate into behavior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because we were not undisciplined among you</b><p>The word &#8220;undisciplined&#8221; points to lazy, disorderly, loafing conduct. Paul&#8217;s team showed the opposite. They worked to support themselves (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), labored &#8220;night and day&#8221; to avoid being a burden (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), and modeled a life ordered by devotion to Christ. Their disciplined lifestyle gave credibility to their message and removed stumbling blocks for the gospel. In <a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34&#8211;35</a> Paul reminds the Ephesian elders, &#8220;You yourselves know that these hands of mine have ministered to my own needs and those of my companions &#8230; by working hard in this way, we must help the weak&#8221;. Discipline was not harsh legalism; it was love in action, protecting the church from sloth and showing the joy of purposeful labor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:7</a> teaches that believers learn holiness by watching and copying faithful examples. Paul points to his own disciplined life as a tangible template: hard-working, orderly, self-sacrificing. The verse invites every Christian to embrace that same pattern, ensuring that the gospel is adorned with conduct that is diligent, responsible, and worthy of imitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">For</span> justifies the assertion that they <span class= "ital">had</span> received a better teaching.
