The "day" signifies a specific time appointed by God for the fulfillment of His divine plan. This event is anticipated throughout the New Testament, notably in <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, where Christ's return is described as visible and glorious. The Second Coming is a time of judgment and redemption, marking the culmination of history and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>to be glorified in His saints</b><br>The glorification of Christ in His saints indicates the transformation and exaltation of believers. Saints, in this context, refer to all who have been sanctified through faith in Jesus. This glorification is both a reflection of Christ's own glory and a participation in it, as believers are conformed to His image (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>). The saints' lives, transformed by grace, will manifest Christ's glory, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, where the light of God's glory shines through His people.<p><b>and regarded with wonder by all who have believed</b><br>This phrase highlights the awe and reverence that believers will experience at Christ's return. The wonder stems from the fulfillment of God's promises and the revelation of His majesty. Believers, having lived by faith, will see the reality of their hope realized (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). This wonder is not just admiration but a profound recognition of God's power and faithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee bows to Christ.<p><b>including you who have believed our testimony</b><br>Paul personalizes the message to the Thessalonian believers, affirming their inclusion in the community of faith. The "testimony" refers to the gospel message preached by Paul and his companions, which the Thessalonians accepted (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). This acceptance is a testament to the transformative power of the gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.

As the persecutors were divided into two classes to be punished, so the saved are described under two aspects: in contrast with "them that know not God" they are "saints," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>fully consecrated to God; in contrast with "them that obey not the gospel" they are "they that believed" (for the past tense is the better reading), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>accepted the gospel. As the profane Gentiles, looking on the saints, recognise the "glory" of the God whom they knew not, so the disobedient Jews, seeing the faithful, are aptly filled with "wonder" (<a href="/acts/13-41.htm" title="Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.">Acts 13:41</a>), before they perish, at the glory to be attained by obedience to the law of suffering. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span>; defining the period when this judgment of the wicked will occur. <span class="cmt_word">He</span>; namely, the Lord Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Shall come to be glorified;</span> the purpose of his coming. <span class="cmt_word">In</span>; not "through," or "among," but "in," as the sphere or element of his glory. <span class="cmt_word">His saints;</span> not the holy angels who will accompany him to judgment, but holy men whom he has redeemed with his blood. Christ will be glorified in his saints, inasmuch as their glory was the result of his sufferings and death, and their holiness is the reflection of his holiness; "They will reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">And to be admired;</span> wondered at, praised. <span class="cmt_word">In all them that believe;</span> or, <span class="accented">believed.</span> The work of faith is past; the result of faith, the state of sight and glory, has commenced. The glorification of believers will thus become the glorification of Christ. The glory of Christ does not arise from the punishment of the wicked, but from the glorification of believers. Christ will indeed be glorified in the punishment of the wicked. His justice will be manifested and vindicated; but his glory will be especially seen in the manifestation of his mercy toward believers. <span class="cmt_word">Because our testimony;</span> namely, the testimony of Paul and his associates, Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">Among you;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">unto you. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Was believed;</span> to be considered as a parenthesis. <span class="cmt_word">In that day;</span> namely, the day of the Lord's advent, to be connected with the commencement of the verse, "In that day when he shall come to be glorified in his saints." Some, overlooking the parenthesis, render the words either, "because our testimony concerning that day was believed among you;" or, "because our testimony among you shall be believed on that day" - assented to by the whole universe; but the first rendering gives a false meaning to the preposition, and the second a false construction to the verb, as if it were future. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
