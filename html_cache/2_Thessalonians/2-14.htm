The calling is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign will. This aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, which speaks of those whom God predestined, He also called. The calling is a personal invitation to enter into a relationship with God, reflecting the biblical theme of God as the initiator of salvation.<p><b>through our gospel</b><br>The "gospel" refers to the good news of Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>. The use of "our gospel" indicates the message preached by Paul and his companions, which is consistent with the apostolic teaching. This highlights the importance of the apostolic witness and the transmission of the gospel message through the early church. The gospel is the means by which God calls individuals to salvation, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-15</a>.<p><b>so that you may share</b><br>This phrase points to the purpose of the calling, which is to participate in something greater. The concept of sharing or partaking is common in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to rejoice as they share in Christ's sufferings. It implies a communal aspect of the Christian faith, where believers are united in their experience and destiny.<p><b>in the glory</b><br>"Glory" in the biblical sense often refers to the divine presence and majesty of God. In this context, it suggests the future state of believers who will be transformed and glorified, as described in <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>. This glory is not only a future hope but also a present reality in the sense that believers reflect God's glory in their lives (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><b>of our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase identifies the source and focus of the glory. Jesus Christ is central to the Christian faith, and His lordship is a key theme throughout the New Testament. The title "Lord" signifies His authority and divinity, while "Jesus Christ" emphasizes His role as the Messiah. The glory believers are called to share is intrinsically linked to the person and work of Jesus, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving His glory to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is writing to the church in Thessalonica to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

The election or choice takes place in eternity (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13</a>); the call at that point of time when the men first hear the gospel. (See <a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By our gospel</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, of course, "by our bringing you the happy message"--the historical delivery of the message is dwelt on rather than its contents.<p><span class= "bld">To the obtaining of the glory of our Lord.</span>--Almost all the ancient commentators render it, "for obtaining of glory to our Lord;" and St. Chrysostom says, beautifully:" No small thing this either, if Christ esteems our salvation His glory. It is, indeed, a glory to the lover of men that the number of those who are being saved should be large." But this version is not so easy grammatically as our own, nor does it suit so well with the context. St. Paul is encouraging his readers with the same thought of their destiny which he has put forward in <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2Thessalonians 1:11-12</a>--the identity of the joy of the Redeemer and the redeemed (<a href="/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>). It is well to be observed that God did not call them straight "to the glory of our Lord," but "to the obtaining" of the same. This "obtaining" does not mean an otiose receiving of glory in the last day, but a laborious course of "earning" or "purchasing" it during this life. The word is the same as that used in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>, where see Note. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto</span>; <span class="accented">to which.</span> The reference being to the whole clause, being "chosen to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth." <span class="cmt_word">He called you.</span> Whom God elects from eternity, he calls in time. <span class="cmt_word">By our gospel;</span> the gospel preached by us. <span class="cmt_word">To the obtaining</span> (or, <span class="accented">acquisition</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Different meaning's have been attached to these words; some render them "for the purpose of an acquisition of glory to Jesus Christ;" others, "for a glorious possession of Jesus Christ;" and others, "to be possessors or sharers in the glory of Jesus Christ."
