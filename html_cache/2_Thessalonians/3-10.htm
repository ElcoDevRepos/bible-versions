It emphasizes the apostolic authority and the personal nature of the teaching. The context is Paul's second missionary journey, as recorded in <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>, where he established the church in Thessalonica. The use of "command" suggests a directive that is not merely advice but a binding instruction, reflecting the seriousness with which Paul viewed the issue of idleness. This command is consistent with the broader biblical principle of diligence and responsibility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>, which warns against laziness.<p><b>If anyone is unwilling to work,</b><br>The focus here is on the unwillingness to work, not the inability. This distinction is crucial, as it addresses those who choose idleness over productivity. In the Greco-Roman world, work was often seen as a necessary part of life, and idleness was frowned upon. The early Christian community was expected to be self-sufficient and not a burden to others, reflecting the Jewish work ethic rooted in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to work and take care of it. This principle is also echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, which stresses the importance of providing for one's family.<p><b>he shall not eat.</b><br>This phrase underscores the consequence of refusing to work: the denial of sustenance. It reflects a principle of justice and personal responsibility, where the community is not obligated to support those who are capable but unwilling to contribute. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The early church practiced communal living and shared resources, as described in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, but this was not meant to support laziness. Instead, it was a model of mutual support where everyone contributed according to their ability. The directive also serves as a deterrent against exploiting the generosity of the community, ensuring that resources are used wisely and justly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is addressing the Thessalonian church.

It does not give the reason why St. Paul and his companions worked: "because we strictly enjoined you to work, and therefore could not be idle ourselves." Rather, it justifies the reiteration of the command: "We do not hesitate to command you now to repress this disorderly conduct, so contrary to the example set you; for, in fact, when we were with you we used to lay down this law." So Theodoret takes it: "It is no new thing that we write to you."<p><span class= "bld">We commanded.</span>--The tense in the original is that of constant re-assertion, which brings out once more the thorough grounding which the Apostles gave at once to their converts. (See Note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a> : "the tradition;" also the Note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2Thessalonians 2:5</a>.) The same definite precept is referred to in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For even when we were with you;</span> during our residence in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">This we commanded, that if any man would not work, neither should he eat.</span> This or similar expressions have been shown to be a proverb in frequent use among the Jews. Thus: "Whoever doth not work doth not eat" ('Bereshith Rabba'); "Let not him who would not labour before the sabbath eat on the sabbath" ('In Lib. Zenon.'). It is a law of nature, and the apostle here sanctions it as a law of Christianity. There is here a reference to the sentence pronounced on man in Paradise in consequence of disobedience: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Labour, indeed, may in one point of view be considered as part of the curse, but it is also a blessing adapted to man's fallen nature. Labour is the law of God; idleness is the parent of many crimes and is productive of misery. He who has no business allotted to him ought to choose some useful occupation for himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
