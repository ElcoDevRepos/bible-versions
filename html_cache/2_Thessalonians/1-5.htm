Their endurance serves as evidence of God's righteous judgment, indicating that their faith is genuine and that God is just in allowing them to suffer for a greater purpose. The concept of God's righteous judgment is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as a just judge (<a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). The trials faced by the Thessalonians are seen as a refining process, similar to the testing of faith described in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>. This judgment is not punitive for believers but purifying, aligning with the idea that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><b>And so you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God,</b><br>The phrase "counted worthy" suggests a process of sanctification, where believers are being prepared for the kingdom of God. This is not about earning salvation through works but about being transformed into the likeness of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing both a present reality and a future hope (<a href="/luke/17-21.htm">Luke 17:21</a>, <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>). The worthiness mentioned here is linked to the believers' faithfulness and perseverance, echoing Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>, where those who are persecuted for righteousness are blessed and promised the kingdom of heaven.<p><b>for which you are suffering.</b><br>The suffering of the Thessalonians is a direct result of their faith in Christ, aligning with the broader New Testament theme that suffering is an integral part of the Christian experience (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). This suffering is not without purpose; it serves to strengthen their faith and witness to others. The early church often faced persecution from both Jewish and Roman authorities, as Christianity was seen as a threat to traditional religious and social structures. The Thessalonians' endurance in suffering is a testament to their commitment to Christ and serves as an encouragement to other believers facing similar trials. This suffering also connects to the sufferings of Christ, who endured the cross for the joy set before Him (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>), providing a model for believers to follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is writing to the church in Thessalonica to encourage and instruct them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians facing persecution and trials for their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>The divine evaluation and decision-making process that is just and fair, as referenced in the verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_god.htm">Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The spiritual realm over which God reigns, and the ultimate hope and destination for believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/suffering_for_faith.htm">Suffering for Faith</a></b><br>The trials and tribulations faced by the Thessalonian believers as a result of their commitment to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_righteous_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is always just and fair, even when it involves suffering.

The indication of God's righteous judgment consisted not so much in the vitality and growth of the Thessalonians' faith and love as in the very fact of their being persecuted; such persecution was an actual indication how the fair judgment of God would go in the last day. No undue stress is to be laid upon the epithet "righteous," as if it were "a token of the <span class= "ital">righteousness of</span> God's judgment;" the point is only to indicate already <span class= "ital">what</span> a fair judge was likely to decide.<p><span class= "bld">That ye may be counted worthy.</span>--This expresses the result, not of the future judgment of God, but of the patient sufferings which reveal what that judgment will be. The "counting worthy" (or rather, perhaps, the "<span class= "ital">declaring</span> worthy") is, in fact, the "judgment" or sentence itself. "You suffer in such a manner that we can forecast the fair verdict of God: viz., so as to be then declared (the Greek tense points to a distinct moment of forming the estimate) fit to receive God's kingdom." The word "counted worthy" has in this place nothing to do with the theological question of merit.<p><span class= "bld">The kingdom of God.</span>--Which had formed a prominent feature of the first preaching at Thessalonica. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to the First Epistle to the Thessalonians.</span>) Are the Thessalonian Christians, then, not yet in the kingdom of God? Yes; but only as its <span class= "ital">subjects:</span> hereafter they are to be counted worthy not of admission into it, but of it itself--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to inherit it, to become kings of it. (Comp. the parallel argument in <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2Timothy 2:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For which ye also suffer.</span>--St. Paul is very fond of this "also" in relative clauses; it tightens the coupling between the relative and antecedent clauses, and so brings out more clearly the vital connection between suffering and reigning. They suffer "for the kingdom," not merely for the sake of winning it, but on its behalf, in defence of it, in consequence of being its citizens, to extend its dominion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Which is <span class="cmt_word">a manifest token.</span> A sentence in apposition, so that the words, "which is," printed in italics, ought to be omitted.

These words imply that the sufferings of the righteous and the prosperity of their wicked persecutors was a clear proof that there shall be a future state of retribution, when the inequalities of the present state of things will be adjusted, when the apparent violations of justice will be rectified, and when matters will be completely reversed - when the persecutors will be punished and the persecuted rewarded (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>, "And in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God"). <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; in order that, indicating the purpose of God's dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Ye may be counted worthy.</span> Paul here finds, in the faith and patience of the Thessalonians amid persecution, an evidence of a state of reward, as well as in the cruelties of their persecutors an evidence of a state of punishment. The idea that man can merit salvation as a reward from God is not contained in this passage. As all men are sinners, salvation can only be obtained through the merits and mediation of Christ. But with this grace of God, justice is not abolished; the righteous will be rewarded for their faith and patience (comp. <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>; also <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kingdom of God;</span> namely, the Messianic kingdom which Christ will establish at the advent: here the heavenly state. <span class="cmt_word">For which;</span> for the sake of which. <span class="cmt_word">Ye also suffer;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">are sufferin</span>g; the sufferings being continued down to the time when the apostle wrote this Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ All this is ] clear evidence</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Endeigma)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1730.htm">Strong's 1730: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a thing proved, hence) a plain token (sign, proof).
