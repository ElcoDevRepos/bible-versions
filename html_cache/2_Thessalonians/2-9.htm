The term "lawless one" highlights his rebellion against God's laws. This concept is rooted in Jewish apocalyptic literature and is echoed in other New Testament passages such as 1 <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. The Antichrist is seen as a culmination of evil, a personification of sin and rebellion that will arise before the second coming of Christ.<p><b>will be accompanied by the working of Satan</b><br>This indicates that the Antichrist's power and influence are not of human origin but are empowered by Satan himself. The "working of Satan" suggests a supernatural element, as Satan is often depicted in the Bible as a deceiver and adversary (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>). This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of spiritual warfare, where Satan opposes God's plans and seeks to lead people astray.<p><b>with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder</b><br>The Antichrist will perform miraculous acts that mimic the signs and wonders of God, but these are deceptive in nature. The use of "every kind" implies a wide array of supernatural phenomena designed to deceive. This mirrors the warnings given by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>, where false prophets and false Christs will perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. These false wonders serve to validate the Antichrist's authority in the eyes of the deceived, contrasting with the true miracles performed by Jesus and His apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lawless_one.htm">The Lawless One</a></b><br>Often interpreted as the Antichrist, a figure who opposes God and deceives many.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary of God, who empowers the lawless one with deceptive abilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>The city where the Thessalonian church was located, to whom Paul wrote this letter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, providing guidance and warning to the Thessalonian believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous events that are used to deceive, not from God but empowered by Satan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_is_essential.htm">Discernment is Essential</a></b><br>Believers must cultivate spiritual discernment to recognize false signs and wonders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">The Reality of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Understand that there is an ongoing spiritual battle, and Satan uses deception as a primary weapon.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stay_rooted_in_scripture.htm">Stay Rooted in Scripture</a></b><br>Regular study and meditation on God's Word help believers to identify and resist deception.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Prayer is crucial in seeking God's wisdom and protection against the schemes of the enemy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ's_victory.htm">Hope in Christ's Victory</a></b><br>Despite the presence of evil, believers can have confidence in the ultimate victory of Christ over all lawlessness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Thessalonians_2_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Thessalonians 2:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Thess_2_9_s_warning_on_false_wonders.htm">How does 2 Thessalonians 2:9 warn us about deception through "false signs and wonders"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_discernment_spot_the_lawless_one.htm">What role does discernment play in recognizing "the coming of the lawless one"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_strengthen_faith_against_evil.htm">How can we strengthen our faith to resist "every kind of evil"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_warn_of_false_wonders.htm">What other scriptures warn against being deceived by "false signs and wonders"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_2_Thess_2_9_daily.htm">How can we apply 2 Thessalonians 2:9 in our daily spiritual walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Thessalonians_2_9_on_Antichrist_s_power.htm">What does 2 Thessalonians 2:9 reveal about the nature of the Antichrist's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Thess_2_9_s_impact_on_signs_wonders.htm">How does 2 Thessalonians 2:9 challenge our understanding of signs and wonders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_allow_Antichrist_s_false_miracles.htm">Why does God allow the Antichrist to perform deceptive miracles according to 2 Thessalonians 2:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_thessalonians_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Thessalonians 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_great_deception_about.htm">What is The Great Deception about?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_it_like_to_meet_the_antichrist.htm">How will encountering the Antichrist feel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_is_the_man_of_lawlessness.htm">Who is the man of lawlessness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_did_magicians_do_miracles.htm">How did Pharaoh's magicians perform miracles?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Thessalonians 2:9 Mean</div><b>The coming of the lawless one</b><p>&#8220;The coming of the lawless one &#8230;&#8221;

Because God has forewarned His people, believers can recognize the counterfeit, stand firm in truth, and await the genuine glory of Jesus&#8217; return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Even him, whose coming.</span>--The "even him" does not stand in the Greek; and "whose" might, again, be rendered by <span class= "ital">for his own, </span>or perhaps "though his own." The purpose of the verses following is not merely to describe Antichrist more fully, but to compare word for word his coming with that which will annihilate him. Again is used of Antichrist a peculiar word consecrated to the Christ: "coming" (literally <span class= "ital">presence</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>being the word used in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>, as well as <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2Thessalonians 2:1</a>, and often.

The word "lying" (literally, <span class= "ital">of falsehood</span>) should go with all three names, "all counterfeit power and signs and wonders." The three words are piled up to heighten the terror of the description; if you press them they mean that there will be a display of power, to attest Antichrist's doctrine (signs), and to keep men spellbound in admiration of him (wonders). Antichrist, like Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm" title="Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;">1Timothy 6:15</a>), has one to support him--Satan instead of God; he, like Christ (<a href="/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>), will have his miracles--but miracles of trickery, not of truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The apostle resumes his description of the man of sin. <span class="accented">Even him</span>; not in the original, but necessary for the sense. <span class="cmt_word">Whose coming.</span> The use of the same term, <span class="accented">parousia</span>, employed to denote the coming of Christ exhibits the counterpart of the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Is after the working</span> - according to the energy - <span class="cmt_word">of Satan.</span> Satan is the agent who works in the man of sin; he being the organ or instrument of Satan. <span class="cmt_word">With all power and signs and lying wonders.</span> The adjective "lying" ought to be rendered as a substantive, and applied to all three: "With all powers and signs and wonders of falsehood;" whose origin, nature, and purpose is falsehood. Here, also, the counterpart to Christ is manifest; for the same terms - "powers," "signs," and "wonders," are employed to denote his miracles (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). The miracles of Christ were miracles of truth; the miracles of the man of sin would be miracles of falsehood. There does not seem to be any essential difference between powers, signs, and wonders; but the words are employed as a mere rhetorical enumeration. It is not to be supposed that the man of sin will be enabled to perform real miracles; they are the wonders of falsehood; but still by them his followers will be deceived (comp. <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
