This restraint is often interpreted as a divine or spiritual force preventing the "man of lawlessness" from being revealed prematurely. The identity of the restrainer has been debated, with suggestions including the Holy Spirit, the church, or a governing authority. The concept of restraint aligns with biblical themes of God's sovereignty and timing, as seen in <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>, where God sets limits on Satan's actions.<p><b>so that he may be revealed</b><br>The "he" refers to the "man of lawlessness" mentioned earlier in the chapter, often associated with the Antichrist. This revelation is part of eschatological events leading to the end times. The idea of revelation is significant in biblical prophecy, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, where the Antichrist is described as a figure who opposes God and deceives many. The revealing is a divine act, indicating God's control over the unfolding of prophetic events.<p><b>at the proper time</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's perfect timing in the unfolding of end-time events. The "proper time" suggests a divinely appointed moment, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. It reassures believers of God's ultimate plan and timing, as seen in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, where Christ's coming is described as occurring in the "fullness of time." This timing underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the assurance that God's purposes will be fulfilled according to His schedule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Thessalonica, providing guidance and clarification on eschatological matters.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thessalonian_church.htm">The Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a community of believers in Thessalonica facing confusion and concern about the end times and the return of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_restrainer.htm">The Restrainer</a></b><br>A mysterious force or person mentioned by Paul that is currently holding back the revelation of the "man of lawlessness."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_lawlessness.htm">The Man of Lawlessness</a></b><br>A figure associated with end-time events, whose revelation is being restrained until the proper time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proper_time.htm">The Proper Time</a></b><br>The divinely appointed moment when the "man of lawlessness" will be revealed, according to God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_restraint.htm">Understanding Restraint</a></b><br>The concept of restraint in this passage highlights God's control over end-time events.

The church&#8217;s Spirit-indwelt presence curbs lawlessness, ensuring that evil cannot fully manifest until the Father&#8217;s precise time. This truth steadies believers, reminding us that history is under God&#8217;s control, deception is exposed by revealed truth, and every prophetic event will unfold exactly on schedule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And now ye know.</span>--Not "now, because of what I have just said," for nothing has yet been said in the Letter from which the Thessalonians could gather what withheld the premature manifestation of the Man of Sin. The word "now" is not used exactly in a temporal sense, but as introducing another item. "You remember about Antichrist and his characteristics: very good; and now, what keeps Antichrist back? You know that too." Knowing not only that Antichrist's apocalypse must precede Christ's, but also that Antichrist could not reveal himself yet, because the way was blocked by something still (as they saw) unremoved, the Thessalonians were absurd in acting as if the day of the Lord was come.<p><span class= "bld">What withholdeth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that which withholdeth:</span> they did not merely know it as a dogma, but as a familiar object. "You are perfectly acquainted with the thing which acts as a check upon the Man of Sin." Unlike the Man of Sin himself, who was a dim figure in the mysterious future, the Obstacle was present and tangible. They may have forgotten what the thing is, but St. Paul stirs their memory by telling them that they well know the thing itself. It must needs be a marked and mighty power which can prevent the development of the great Antichrist. At the same time, St. Paul's doctrine is that this marked power is destined by-and-by to be removed (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>). Possibly, then, St. Paul may shrink from naming it in writing, not only because he wishes to exercise the Thessalonians' memories, but also for fear the power should discover and disapprove of his prophecies. For the question what the withholding power is, see the <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Interpretation of the Prophecy.</span><p><span class= "bld">That he might . . . in his time.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">with a view to his being revealed at his proper moment.</span> Not that the withholding power is conscious of such desire, but God's design is to use that power for the purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now.</span> The particle "now" has been variously interpreted. Some connect it with the restraining influence: "And ye know what now withholdeth;" but if so, there would have been a different arrangement of the words in the original Others consider it as a mere particle of transition: "Now, to pass over to another subject;" but there is no transition, the apostle continues his description of the man of sin. It is rather to be considered as a particle of time: "Now ye know, because you have been instructed on this point." <span class="cmt_word">Ye know;</span> Paul having told them when he was at Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">What withholdeth</span>; hindereth. The hindrance does not refer to the prevention of the apostle from speaking freely on this subject, lest he should involve himself in political difficulties; nor to any delay in the coming of Christ; but to a restraint upon the appearance of the man of sin: "Ye know what prevents his open manifestation." <span class="cmt_word">That he;</span> namely, the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Might be revealed in his time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in his season</span>; in his proper time, the time appointed by God. Events were not yet ripe for his appearance. Just as there was a "fulness of time" when Christ should appear (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), so there was a "fulness of time" when the man of sin should be revealed; there was a series of events going on which would culminate in his revelation. The nature of this restraining or withholding influence will afterwards be considered; whatever it was, the Thessalonians were formerly explicitly informed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(oidate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
