It highlights His divine authority and active role in providing spiritual blessings. The use of "Himself" underscores the personal relationship believers have with Christ, who is not distant but intimately involved in their lives. This reflects the New Testament theme of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>and God our Father</b><br>The inclusion of "God our Father" alongside Jesus Christ emphasizes the unity and cooperation within the Trinity. It reflects the familial relationship believers have with God, who is not just a distant deity but a loving Father. This echoes the teachings of Jesus, who often referred to God as Father, encouraging believers to approach Him with the same intimacy (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>).<p><b>who by grace has loved us</b><br>The phrase "by grace" highlights the unmerited favor of God. It is a central theme in Pauline theology, emphasizing that salvation and God's love are not earned but freely given (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This love is foundational to the Christian faith, as it is the motivation behind God's redemptive plan (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>and given us eternal comfort</b><br>"Eternal comfort" refers to the everlasting consolation and peace that believers receive through their relationship with God. This comfort is not temporary or dependent on circumstances but is rooted in the eternal promises of God. It connects to the assurance of salvation and the hope of eternal life (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>).<p><b>and good hope</b><br>"Good hope" signifies a confident expectation of future blessings, grounded in the promises of God. This hope is not wishful thinking but a sure and steadfast anchor for the soul (<a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>). It is a recurring theme in the New Testament, encouraging believers to remain steadfast in faith despite trials (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_jesus_christ.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, believed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.

"Again," says St. Chrysostom, "prayer after advice: this is to help in earnest." The word "Himself," as in the passage cited, contrasts the Almighty power of our Lord with the partial instructions and feeble help which even Apostles could give, and with the impotence of the Thessalonian Christians to stand firm in their own strength.<p><span class= "bld">Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father.</span>--The order of mention is unusual. (See, however, <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a>.) It is not designedly meant to show the equality of the Blessed Persons, which is done only incidentally by the fact that the same aspiration is directed to both. Probably, in fact, the names are arranged to form a climax: St. Paul having spoken first of the Person whose work on the heart is the more immediate, and then jealously watching lest he should in any way make the Eternal Father seem less deeply interested in our welfare than the Son is. All primitive devotion and doctrine are markedly opposed to the tendency to rest in the Mediator without a real lively faith in the Father who sent Him.<p><span class= "bld">Which hath loved us.</span>--Love to us is <span class= "ital">specially</span> (so fearfully wrong is much of the popular language about the Atonement) the characteristic of the <span class= "ital">Father.</span> (See, for instance, <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm" title="But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>.) It is in the thought of this tender love of God to us that the writer adds immediately the endearing title "<span class= "ital">Our</span> Father." This love seems to be mentioned here as being the ground on which the writer rests his hope for the fulfilment of his prayer. It should literally be translated, <span class= "ital">which loved us, and gave</span>--the moment being apparently (as in <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>) the moment of providing the Atonement for our sins. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now our Lord Jesus Christ, and God, even our Father, who hath loved us.</span> These last words, "who hath loved us," are to be restricted to God our Father, whoso love was manifested in sending his Son to rescue sinners from destruction. <span class="cmt_word">And hath given us everlasting consolation;</span> or, <span class="accented">comfort</span>; everlasting as contrasted with the temporary and deceitful comfort which the world gives. <span class="cmt_word">And good hope through grace;</span> or, <span class="accented">in grace.</span> "In grace" belongs to the verb "hath given," and denotes the mode of the gift - of his own free grace, in contrast to personal merit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now {may}</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
