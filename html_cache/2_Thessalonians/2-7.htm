Here, it pertains to the pervasive influence of lawlessness, which is a rebellion against God's order. This concept of lawlessness can be traced back to the fall of man in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> and is evident throughout Scripture, such as in the days of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>) and the lawlessness of Israel (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The Apostle Paul indicates that this spirit of rebellion is not a future event but is already active in the world, aligning with Jesus' teachings on the increase of lawlessness in the end times (<a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>).<p><b>but the one who now restrains it</b><br>This phrase suggests the presence of a restraining force or person that holds back the full manifestation of lawlessness. The identity of this restrainer has been widely debated, with interpretations ranging from the Holy Spirit, the church, or a governing authority. The restrainer's role is crucial in God's sovereign plan, preventing the complete revelation of the "man of lawlessness" until the appointed time. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's control over the unfolding of prophetic events, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons and removes kings.<p><b>will continue until he is taken out of the way</b><br>The continuation of the restraining force is temporary, indicating a future point when it will be removed. This removal is a significant eschatological event, paving the way for the revelation of the "man of lawlessness" mentioned earlier in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>. The phrase suggests a divine timetable, where God allows the progression of events according to His purpose. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/17-17.htm">Revelation 17:17</a>, where God puts it into the hearts of rulers to accomplish His will. The removal of the restrainer marks a pivotal moment in the prophetic timeline, leading to the culmination of end-time events and the eventual return of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Thessalonica to clarify misunderstandings about the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the early Christian church was established.

In harmony with these passages, many recognize the restrainer as the Holy Spirit working through the church, empowering believers as &#8220;salt&#8221; and &#8220;light&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13&#8211;16</a>;

This aligns with the promise that Christ will gather His church prior to the Day of the Lord&#8217;s wrath (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; 5:9; <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226;

Until then, believers stand firm, confident that God&#8217;s sovereign restraint remains in place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--Logically, the "for" belongs to the clause "he that letteth;" thus:" For, although the mystery is already at work, the wicked one will not be revealed until he that now withholds shall disappear."<p><span class= "bld">The mystery of iniquity doth already work.</span>--Both "mystery" and "iniquity" have the article in the Greek, perhaps (as in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>) because the phrase was well known to the Thessalonians. <span class= "ital">Lawlessness</span> is a more literal rendering than "iniquity"; the same word in <a href="/1_john/3-4.htm" title="Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.">1John 3:4</a> is rendered "the transgression of the law." The word "mystery" in Greek does not necessarily involve any notion of mysteriousness in our modern sense. It means a secret (which may be, in its own nature, quite simple) known to the initiated, but incapable of being known until it is divulged. Here the whole emphasis is thrown, by a very peculiar order of the Greek words, upon the word "mystery." It may be paraphrased thus:--"For <span class= "ital">as a secret, </span>into which the world is not yet initiated, that lawlessness is <span class= "ital">already</span> at work." Thus the word "mystery" stands in sharp contrast with the word "revealed" in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2Thessalonians 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a> : the time for publishing, openly avowing, the secret is not yet come. To whom, then, is the mystery of that lawlessness now known? Not to all those who are contributing to its ultimate manifestation, for most of them are deceived by it (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a>), and, while sharers in the Apostasy, still believe themselves members of the Church. The mystery is known to God, and (1) to enlightened Christians like St. Paul; (2) to Satan and a few Satanic men who avow to themselves their real object in joining the movement. Though the mystery is said to work (the verb expresses an inward activity, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1Thessalonians 2:13</a>, <a href="/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>, like that of leaven on the lump), it is not a personal thing, not (like "Man of Sin," "that which withholdeth,") a covert description of any person or set of persons; it is solely the unavowed design which is gradually gaining influence over men's hearts: it is the same movement as the "falling away" of <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>. In several places (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/jude/1-18.htm" title="How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.">Jude 1:18</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) the coarser side of the "falling away" is spoken of, but here the "lawlessness" seems not so much to mean ordinary antinomianism as insubordination to God--rebellion. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the mystery.</span> "Mystery" here denotes something which was unknown or secret before it was revealed (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>).

Even at the time the apostle wrote the seeds of apostasy were already sown; the leaven of lawlessness was fermenting inside Christianity; the foundations of a false Christianity were being laid. Thus the apostle warned the Ephesians that false teachers would arise from among themselves; to Timothy he writes of those perilous times which were then present; and, in his Epistles, mention is made of false practices and doctrines, such as the worship of angels, abstinence from meats, bodily mortifications, and the honour conferred on celibacy. So also John, in his First Epistle, refers to this working of this antichristian power when he says, "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists .... Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world" (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>). "Antichrist does not step on the scene suddenly without any preparations; on the contrary, a stream of anti-christian sentiment and conduct pervades the whole history of the world" (Olshausen). <span class="cmt_word">Only he that now letteth;</span> or, <span class="accented">restraineth</span>, the old meaning of the word "let." <span class="accented">Will let.</span> These words are not in the original, and ought to be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Until he be taken out of the way.</span> The whole clause ought to be rendered, "The mystery of lawlessness is already working, only until he who restraineth is removed;" when that takes place, when the restraining influence is removed, the mystery of lawlessness will no longer work secretly, but will be openly manifested. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
