This reflects the deep bond and spiritual responsibility he feels towards them. In the early church, the term "brothers" signifies a familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and equality in Christ. This phrase also highlights the importance of gratitude in the Christian life, as seen in other Pauline letters (e.g., <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>). The continuous nature of this thanksgiving ("all the time") underscores the ongoing work of God in the lives of the Thessalonians.<p><b>as is fitting</b><br>Paul acknowledges that giving thanks is the appropriate response to the work God is doing among the Thessalonians. This phrase suggests that recognizing and expressing gratitude for God's blessings is a natural and proper action for believers. It aligns with the biblical principle that all good things come from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) and that believers should acknowledge His hand in their lives. The concept of what is "fitting" or "appropriate" is also seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices, which is their "reasonable service."<p><b>because your faith is growing more and more</b><br>The Thessalonians' faith is not static; it is dynamic and increasing. This growth in faith is a sign of spiritual maturity and is a cause for thanksgiving. The idea of faith growing is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>, which encourages believers to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Thessalonians' increasing faith is particularly significant given the persecution they faced (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>), demonstrating their steadfastness and reliance on God.<p><b>and your love for one another is increasing</b><br>The increase in love among the Thessalonian believers is another reason for Paul's gratitude. Love is a central theme in the New Testament, often seen as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>) and the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). The Thessalonians' growing love for one another is a testament to their obedience to Christ's command to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). This love is not merely an emotion but is demonstrated through actions and service, reflecting the love of Christ. The increase in love also serves as a witness to the surrounding community, showcasing the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, expressing gratitude and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silvanus.htm">Silvanus (Silas)</a></b><br>A companion of Paul, likely involved in the writing and delivery of the letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>Another companion of Paul, who also played a role in the ministry to the Thessalonians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of believers in Thessalonica, a city in Macedonia.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one to whom Paul gives thanks for the growth and love evident in the Thessalonian church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_as_a_spiritual_discipline.htm">Gratitude as a Spiritual Discipline</a></b><br>Paul models the importance of regularly thanking God for the spiritual growth of others.

It is a metaphor from vegetable or animal growth. This was one of the very points about which St. Paul was anxious the last time that he had written: then there were deficiencies in their faith (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Charity.</span>--Here, too, St. Paul remembers what he had said to them in the last Epistle, in which he had devoted a whole section to the love of the brethren "toward each other." "Of every one of you all" is a very noticeable expression, as showing the individual solicitude of the Apostles for their converts. Just as the apostolic instructions were given to each Christian privately (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,">1Thessalonians 2:11</a>), so news has been brought how each several Christian is progressing. The differences which had called forth such passages as <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6-10</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12-14</a>, had apparently all ceased, and mutual love was multiplying. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span>. Not to be restricted to Paul, the plural being used for the singular, as is elsewhere the case (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>); but inclusive of Silas and Timothy, inasmuch as they are mentioned directly before (see note to <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are bound;</span> feel ourselves morally constrained. <span class="cmt_word">To thank God always for you,</span> brethren (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). The apostle first praises his converts for what good was in them, before he censures them for their faults, and in this manner he secures their attention. <span class="cmt_word">As it is meet;</span> as it is right and proper in the circumstances of the case. The words are not to be considered as a parenthetic clause, far less as a tautological expression (Jowett); but they state that the reason of the apostle's thanksgiving arose from the spiritual condition of the Thessalonians; "with the acknowledgment of personal obligation, Paul joins a recognition of the circumstances of the case" (Hofinann). <span class="cmt_word">Because that your faith groweth exceedingly</span> - superabounds - <span class="cmt_word">and the charity of every one of you all.</span> The subject of the apostle's thanksgiving was the increase of the faith and love of the Thessalonians: faith here being faith in Christ, and love being love to man. Faith and love contain in themselves the whole of the Christian life; faith is its commencement, its source; love is not only its outcome, its spiritual action, but its completion; the climax of the Christian life is to be made perfect in love. Here, however, love is restricted by the context to love to believers, or brotherly love. <span class="cmt_word">Toward each other;</span> that is, toward your fellow Christians in Thessalonica. Love is not a mere general affection, but is to be specially manifested - "toward each believer." <span class="cmt_word">Aboundeth</span>; increaseth in intensity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We are obligated</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#966;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(opheilomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3784.htm">Strong's 3784: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, its prolonged form opheileo probably from the base of ophelos; to owe; figuratively, to be under obligation; morally, to fail in duty.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to thank</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eucharistein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2168.htm">Strong's 2168: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eucharistos; to be grateful, i.e. to express gratitude; specially, to say grace at a meal.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(The&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
