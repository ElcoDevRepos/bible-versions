The act of boasting here is not for self-glorification but to encourage other churches by showcasing the Thessalonians' steadfastness. This reflects the early Christian practice of sharing testimonies to strengthen the broader community of believers. The concept of boasting in the Lord is consistent with other Pauline writings, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>, where boasting is directed towards what God has accomplished through His people.<p><b>about your perseverance and faith</b><br>Perseverance and faith are central themes in the New Testament, often linked to the trials faced by believers. The Thessalonians' perseverance (Greek: "hypomon&#275;") indicates a steadfast endurance, a quality highly valued in the early church. Faith here is not merely belief but an active trust in God amidst adversity. This echoes <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are seen as a means to develop perseverance, leading to spiritual maturity.<p><b>in the face of all the persecution and affliction</b><br>The Thessalonian church faced significant persecution, likely from both Jewish and Gentile communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-9</a>. This persecution was a common experience for early Christians, who were often marginalized and oppressed for their beliefs. The mention of both persecution and affliction suggests a range of challenges, from social ostracism to physical suffering. This context underscores the cost of discipleship and the call to remain faithful despite opposition, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>.<p><b>you are enduring</b><br>The present tense indicates ongoing endurance, suggesting that the Thessalonians' trials were not momentary but persistent. This endurance is a testament to their spiritual resilience and reliance on God's strength. The concept of enduring suffering is a recurring theme in the New Testament, with Jesus Himself being the ultimate example of endurance in the face of suffering, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2-3</a>. This endurance is not passive but an active, hopeful waiting for God's deliverance and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul,_silvanus,_and_timothy.htm">Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy</a></b><br>The authors of the letter to the Thessalonians, who are expressing their pride in the Thessalonian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, known for their perseverance and faith amidst persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/churches_of_god.htm">Churches of God</a></b><br>Other Christian communities to whom Paul and his companions boast about the Thessalonians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution_and_affliction.htm">Persecution and Affliction</a></b><br>The trials faced by the Thessalonian believers, which serve as a backdrop for their commendation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia_and_achaia.htm">Macedonia and Achaia</a></b><br>Regions where the Thessalonian church's faith and perseverance were well-known.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_trials.htm">Perseverance in Trials</a></b><br>The Thessalonians are a model of enduring faith amidst persecution.

Staying faithful under fire is both the expectation and the evidence of genuine discipleship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">So that we ourselves.</span>--Why was it less likely that St. Paul and his companions should thus glory in them than other friends did, or perhaps than the Thessalonians themselves? Possibly, because it seemed almost like self-praise to praise their own converts; but much more probably, because the writers had before felt and expressed misgivings on the point: this suits the thought of <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2Thessalonians 1:3</a> better.<p><span class= "bld">Glory in you in the churches of God.</span>--Not only in thanksgiving to God (though, perhaps, outbursts of praise in the public services of "the churches" may be included), but also in talking to other men, at Corinth and elsewhere: so, in return, St. Paul "boasted" to the Thessalonians about the Corinthians (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2Corinthians 9:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Your patience and faith.</span>--It was well proved that St. Paul had no more cause for misgiving, and that the tempter's tempting by persecution had not made the apostolic labours to be in vain. (See <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1Thessalonians 3:5</a>.) "Patience," in the New Testament, does not mean a meek submissiveness, but a heroic endurance. The "faith" here becomes almost equivalent to "hope," except that it introduces the <span class= "ital">ground</span> of such hope: viz., confidence in the living God; it also includes the notion of <span class= "ital">faithfulness.</span><p><span class= "bld">Persecutions and tribulations.</span>--The difference-between the two words is, that while "tribulation" is quite general, and implies no personal enmities, "persecution" means that a certain set of persons were organising active measures for the annoyance of the Church. Such persecution they were still "enduring" when the Letter was written.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that we ourselves.</span> "We" - Paul and Silas and Timothy, the founders of the Church of Thessalonica. "We ourselves," not merely we of our own accord (Hofmann), but we as well as our informants, who brought us this intelligence of the increase of your faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Glory in</span> <span class="cmt_word">you in the Churches of God;</span> that is, in those Churches with which we come in contact; namely, the Church at Corinth and the Churches in Achaia. It would appear from this that several Churches had been founded in Achaia, as, for example, the Church of Cenchrea (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For your patience and faith;</span> not to be weakened as a Hebraism for "your patient faith," or "for the patience of your faith;" nor is faith to be taken in the sense of faithfulness or fidelity (Lunemann); but, as in the previous verse, it denotes "faith in Christ." Patience is steadfast endurance, which, in order to be of any value in the sight of God, must be combined with faith; stoical endurance is not here nor anywhere else inculcated in Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">In all your persecutions and tribulations</span> - afflictions - <span class="cmt_word">that ye endure;</span> or, are enduring; the persecution which arose when Paul was at Thessalonica being continued. The patience and faith of the Thessalonians shone the more brilliantly amid persecution and affliction, even as the stars shine brightest in the dark night. To be a true Christian in the time of peace is a great matter; but to be a true Christian in the season of persecution is a greater; faith is then tested in the furnace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
