The horns symbolize power and authority, often associated with kings or kingdoms in biblical prophecy (see <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>). This contemplation indicates a deep, meditative consideration of the vision's meaning, suggesting the importance of divine revelation and understanding.<p><b>suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them</b><br>The "little horn" represents a new, emerging power that initially seems insignificant. Historically, this has been interpreted as a reference to a future ruler or kingdom that rises unexpectedly. The sudden appearance emphasizes the element of surprise and the dynamic nature of political shifts in prophetic literature.<p><b>and three of the first horns were uprooted before it</b><br>This suggests a forceful displacement of existing powers, indicating a significant change in the political landscape. The uprooting of three horns implies the little horn's aggressive expansion and dominance. This can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy where new powers overthrow established ones, reflecting the tumultuous nature of human history.<p><b>This horn had eyes like those of a man</b><br>The eyes symbolize intelligence, insight, and possibly surveillance, suggesting that this power possesses human-like wisdom or cunning. This anthropomorphic feature indicates a ruler with strategic vision and possibly deceitful intentions, aligning with descriptions of cunning leaders in other prophetic texts (e.g., <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>).<p><b>and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance</b><br>The mouth speaking arrogantly points to blasphemy and pride, characteristics often associated with oppressive rulers in biblical prophecy. This aligns with descriptions of the Antichrist in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>), who exalts himself above all.

Marked by piercing intelligence and brazen blasphemy, this &#8220;little horn&#8221; personifies the final Antichrist who will dominate the revived fourth kingdom, persecute God&#8217;s people, and exalt himself above all gods. Scripture assures that his temporary ascendancy ends under the sovereign judgment of the Ancient of Days, paving the way for the everlasting kingdom of the Son of Man (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I considered.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I kept on looking.</span> Here, for the first time in the course of the vision, there appears a change taking place in the object itself. While the three beasts had passed away unchanged in any material addition, among the ten horns of the fourth beast there was seen to grow up a "little horn." which destroyed three of the other horns. That a man, and not a kingdom, is intended, though the man may be the representative of a kingdom, appears from the mention of "the eyes of a man," indicating craft and cunning, and "the mouth speaking great things," implying vain-glory and blasphemy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I considered the horns, and,behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and,</span> <span class="cmt_word">behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span> The Septuagint Version, if we consider it a rendering of the Massorotic, begins really with the words which are made in it the last clause of the preceding verse, "And counsels were many in its horns." This reading is certainly not to be preferred, although it can easily be understood how it has arisen. The version proceeds, "And behold another born sprang up in the midst of them - little in its horns" - this latter is a doublet - "and three of the former horns were rooted cut by it, and, behold, eyes as human eyes were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things, and it made war against the saints." Theodotion is practically in agreement with the Massoretic text, as is also the Peshitta. As Daniel is gazing, his attention is directed to the horns; he sees their appearance changing. An eleventh horn springs up, much less than any of the former ten; quickly, however, it grows, and before its growth three of the former horns are rooted up. This horn now drew his gaze from all the others: it had human eyes, it had a mouth speaking great things. In the changes of the dream the horn now seems separated from the animal on which it is; it becomes an oppressor, and makes war upon the saints. It is usual to identify this horn with that in ch. 8:7. When carefully looked at, the alleged resemblance is reduced to the fact that in both cases "a horn" is used as a symbol of an oppressor of the saints. We must remember that, according to the figure, these ten horns are contemporary. If we take the typology of the next chapter as our guide, these horns are kingdoms or dynasties. Unlike the Greek Empire, which split up into four, this fourth empire splits up into ten. Another dynasty rises up and sweeps away three of these earlier dynasties. Nothing like this occurred in regard to the empire of the Diadochi. Of course, it is true the number ought not to be pressed, save as a designative symbol. There must, however, be more than five or six, as in such a case <span class="accented">four</span> would be a more natural general number. It may, however, be twelve or fifteen. Several events in the history of the kingdoms that have followed the Roman Empire might satisfy one part of this picture - the replacing of three kingdoms by one. It is a possible enough view that provinces may be referred to, as Jephet-ibn. Ali maintains. As, however, the primary significance of the "horn" is power, the most probable solution seems to us to be to take the "ten" horns as the magistracies of Republican Rome. If we reckon the magistracies, there were fewer, if we take the distinctive individuals occupying the magistracies, more, than ten. The imperial form of government replaced several of these magistracies, which may roughly be reckoned at three. Certainly of the imperial power it might be said that it had a mouth "speaking great things;" for the claim to deification made openly was certainly a new claim. Other monarchs had claimed to be the sons of their god; only the Roman emperors were addressed as <span class="accented">divus</span> during their lifetime. Certainly the empire made war against the saints - against the people of God. It was Nero, a Roman emperor, who decreed war against the Jews; it was Vespasian, another Roman emperor, that began the conquest of Palestine; it was Titus, a third Roman emperor, that captured Jerusalem. Some support may be found for the Jewish idea that it is Titus personally. If we are permitted to take the ten horns as successive emperors, he was the eleventh emperor, and three emperors were swept away before the Flavian dynasty.
