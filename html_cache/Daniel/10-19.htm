The command "Do not be afraid" is a common biblical exhortation, often given by God or His messengers to calm those who are in awe or fear of divine presence (e.g., <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). The term "highly precious" indicates Daniel's esteemed status before God, reflecting his faithfulness and righteousness. This echoes earlier in <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>, where Daniel is also called "highly esteemed." It highlights the special relationship between God and His faithful servants.<p><b>he said. &#8220;Peace be with you!</b><br>The greeting "Peace be with you" is a traditional Hebrew salutation, "Shalom," which conveys not just the absence of conflict but a holistic sense of well-being and divine favor. This peace is a gift from God, often associated with His presence and blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus frequently uses this greeting (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 21</a>), symbolizing the peace He brings through reconciliation with God.<p><b>Be strong now; be very strong!&#8221;</b><br>The call to be strong is a divine encouragement, reminiscent of God's exhortation to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>) as he prepared to lead Israel into the Promised Land. It emphasizes reliance on God's strength rather than human ability. The repetition "be very strong" underscores the importance of courage and resilience in the face of spiritual and physical challenges. This strength is not self-derived but is imparted by God, enabling His servants to fulfill their divine missions.<p><b>As he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said,</b><br>Daniel's response to the angel's words demonstrates the transformative power of divine encouragement. The strengthening is both physical and spiritual, enabling Daniel to continue receiving the vision. This mirrors instances where God's word imparts strength and courage to His people (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>). It signifies the empowering nature of God's presence and promises.<p><b>&#8220;Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's reply shows his readiness and willingness to receive further revelation. The term "my lord" is a respectful address to the angelic messenger, acknowledging his authority as a representative of God. The acknowledgment "for you have strengthened me" indicates Daniel's recognition of the source of his renewed strength. This interaction reflects the biblical theme of God equipping His servants for the tasks He sets before them, as seen in the lives of Moses, Elijah, and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision and message from a heavenly being.

And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> The LXX. has its ordinary translation of the phrase rendered, "man greatly beloved (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>)." They give three words for the repetition of the command, "be strong:" <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>, "<span class="accented">be in</span> good health;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "play the man;" <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>, "be strong." In the last clause the third person is retained, "Let my lord speak, for <span class="accented">he</span> strengthened me" - a change made for symmetry. Theodotion is much closer to the Massoretic text, only he, too, varies the words in the command, and has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>. The Peshitta, like Theodotion, varies the word in the command, In the last clause the verb is put in the passive, "and I was strengthened," For the command the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">confortare et esto robustus</span>; but the last clause is in strict agreement with the Massoretic. It is to be noted that the repetition of the imperative, united by <span class="accented">ray</span>, is unexampled; the various renderings in the versions point to this being felt a difficulty, but do not suggest any variations of reading. Not only is the strengthening touch given, but consoling words are added, "Be strong, yea, be strong." Daniel was called upon to put forth energy, to summon his forces mental and spiritual. He had received the strengthening touch, but his own volition must go along with the aid divinely afforded. It is the combination which we find in our Lord's life; without faith even the miraculous power of our Lord could not be put forth. As we have noted, there is some uncertainty as to the reading, but no change would alter the sense of the passage, "And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened." The words spoken called forth the power that was latent, and had been imparted to Daniel. <span class="accented">And said</span>, <span class="accented">Let my lord speak</span>, <span class="accented">for thou hast strengthened me.</span> Even to hold converse with angelic beings, entailed expenditure of vital energy. The overpowering sense of the spiritual has to be resisted, at least so far, in order that mental action may go on.
