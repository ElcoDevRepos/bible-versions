Although not the primary ruler, Belshazzar was co-regent and managed the kingdom in his father's absence. Historically, this aligns with the accounts of Nabonidus spending extended periods away from Babylon. The name "Belshazzar" means "Bel, protect the king," reflecting the Babylonian practice of invoking their gods for protection. This event occurs after the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, indicating a period of decline for Babylon.<p><b>held a great feast</b><br>Feasts in ancient Babylon were significant social and political events, often used to display wealth, power, and divine favor. This particular feast is notable for its size and opulence, suggesting an attempt to boost morale or demonstrate confidence despite the impending threat from the Medo-Persian army. Such feasts were also occasions for religious rituals and idol worship, which is significant in the context of the chapter's later events.<p><b>for a thousand of his nobles</b><br>The presence of a thousand nobles indicates the scale and importance of the event. Babylonian society was hierarchical, with nobles holding significant power and influence. This gathering of the elite underscores the political nature of the feast, possibly serving as a council of war or a demonstration of unity and strength. The number "thousand" may also symbolize completeness or totality, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the gathering.<p><b>and he drank wine with them</b><br>Drinking wine was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern feasts, often associated with celebration and revelry. In this context, it also suggests a lack of awareness or concern for the looming danger, highlighting Belshazzar's arrogance and complacency. The act of drinking wine with the nobles signifies fellowship and shared purpose, but it also sets the stage for the sacrilegious act of using the sacred vessels from the Jerusalem temple, which follows in the narrative. This act of drinking can be contrasted with the biblical warnings against drunkenness and the call for sobriety, especially in times of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_belshazzar.htm">King Belshazzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon at the time of this event.

In regard to this chapter the peculiar state of the Septuagint text has to be noted. At the beginning of the chapter there are three verses which seem to be either variant versions of the Septuagint text, or versions of a text which was different from that from which the Septuagint has been drawn. Throughout the chapter, further, there are traces of doublets. Most of these variations occur in the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine</span> <span class="cmt_word">before the thousand. As we</span> have just indicated, there are two versions in the Septuagint of several verses in this chapter, and the verse before us is one of these. The first of these is "Baltasar the king made a great feast on the day of the dedication of his palace, and invited from his lords two thousand men." The other reading, which appears to have formed the text, is, "Baltasar the king made a great feast for his companions." The first version seems to have read the dual instead of the singular - a proof of the state of the language, for the dual has practically disappeared in the Targums. The second version has evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. Theodotion reads, "Baltasar the king made a great feast to thousands of his lords, and drank wine before the thousands." The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic text. The numeral is thus omitted in the text of the Septuagint,inserted in the dual in the margin, and appears in Theodotion in the plural. As the shortest text is also the oldest, and omits the numeral, we feel inclined to do so also, the more so as the numeral may have resulted from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">aluph</span>) being put as the interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">rabrab</span>). The clause in the marginal version, "on the day of the dedication of his palace," or, as it is rendered by Paulus Telleusis, "in the day of the dedication of the house of his kingdom," is worthy of notice. From the fact that early in his reign every Ninevite king seems to have begun a palace, this statement has a great deal of verisimilitude. The clause in the Massoretic text, "and drank wine before the thousand," is meaningless, unless as a rhetorical amplification. From the fact that only the first clause appears in the text of the Septuagint, the authenticity of the rest of the verse is rendered doubtful; the more so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> () means "a feast" in Eastern Aramaic, though not in Western. It is a possible solution of the presence of the clause that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, excluded from the text and its place supplied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span>, was placed in the margin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, however, means "before." If there was also in the margin <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span>, "thousands," in the emphatic state; as the translation into Hebrew of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="/genesis/36-17.htm">Genesis 36:17, 15</a> Onkelos). If, further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "companion," appeared as a various reading for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, that would easily be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, "wine;" the verb "to drink" would be added to complete the sense. We have thus all the elements to produce the different versions of the story of the feast. The fact that in what we regard as the marginal reading the clause appears quite differently rendered, confirms us in our suspicion that the Massoretic text presents a case of a "doublet." The reading which begins the chapter in the LXX. may be due to regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> as the verb "to receive." The name Belshazzar has been the occasion of much controversy. It was regarded as one of the proofs of the non-historicity of Daniel that this name occurred at all (as Bertholdt). We were told that the last King of Babylon was Nabunahid, not Belshazzar. The name, however, has turned up in the Mugheir inscription as the son of Nabunahid, and not only so, but in a connection that implies he was associated in the government. From the annals of Nabunahid (2 col.; <span class="accented">vide</span> ' Beitrage zur As-syriologie,' Delitzsch and Haupt, 1891-92, pp. 218-221) we find that from his seventh to his eleventh year, if not from an earlier to a later date, Nabunahid was in retirement in Tema, and "came not to Babil," and the king's son (<span class="accented">Mar Sarri</span>) was with the nobles (<span class="accented">rabuti</span>) snd the army. Even when the king's mother died, the mourning was carried on by the king's sou, Belshazzar. Dr. Hugo Winckler ('Geschichte Babyloniens u. Assuriens,' pp. 315, 316) says Nabunahid remained intentionally far from the capital, and abode continually in Tema, a city otherwise unknown. Not once at the new year's feast, where his personal presence was indispensable, did he come to Babylon. What occasioned it, we know not; but it appears as if he had devoted himself to some kind of solitary life, and would not disturb himself with the business of government. Not once while Cyrus was marching against Babylon did he rouse himself, but allowed things to take their course. The government appears to have been carried on by his son, Bel-shar-utzur, for while Nabunahid lived in Tema in retirement, it is mentioned that his son, with the dignitaries, managed affairs in Babylon, and commanded the army. Also in several inscriptions in the concluding prayer, he is named along with his father, while it is usually the name of the king that is there mentioned. Belshazzar is, then, no mere luxurious despot, like the Nabeandel of Josephus, no incapable youth flushed with the unexpected dignity of government in the city of Babylon, while his father was shut up in Borsippa; he is a bold capable warrior. Tyrannical and imperious he may be, yet faithful to his father, as had Nebuchadnezzar been to Nabopolassar his father. We need not even look at the identifications of Belshazzar with Evil-Merodach, with Labasi-marduk, or with Nabunahid. The name <span class="accented">Bel-shar-utzur</span> means "Bel protects the king," and is rendered in the Greek versions "Baltasar," and in the Vulgate "Baltassar," and identical with the name given to Daniel, as we have remarked elsewhere. In the Peshitta the name here is rendered "Belit-shazar," while Daniel's Babylonian name is "Beletshazzar." We do not know when this feast took place. If we take the Septuagint text here as our guide, it did not take place at the capture of the city by Cyrus. If for five, six, or seven years he was practically king, Belshazzar may have built a palace, and the feast may have been held at its dedication. We knew that the Babylonians were notorious for their banquets - banquets that not infrcquently ended in drunkenness. Although the number of the guests is doubtful from diplomatic reasons, the number itself is not excessive.
