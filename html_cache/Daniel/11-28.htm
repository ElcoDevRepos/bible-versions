After his campaigns in Egypt, he returned with substantial spoils, reflecting the historical accounts of his plundering. The "king of the North" is a term used throughout Daniel to describe the Seleucid rulers, who were north of Israel. This wealth accumulation is consistent with the historical context of Hellenistic rulers who often financed their empires through conquest and plunder.<p><b>but his heart will be set against the holy covenant</b><br>The "holy covenant" refers to the Jewish faith and practices, particularly the Mosaic Law and the temple worship in Jerusalem. Antiochus IV is known for his aggressive Hellenization policies, which included attempts to suppress Jewish religious practices. His heart being set against the covenant indicates his hostility towards the Jewish religion, which is documented in the historical accounts of his desecration of the temple and the persecution of the Jews, leading to the Maccabean Revolt.<p><b>so he will do damage</b><br>This damage is understood as the persecution and oppression of the Jewish people, including the desecration of the Second Temple. Antiochus IV's actions are seen as a direct attack on the Jewish faith, fulfilling the prophecy of a ruler who would cause great suffering. This aligns with the broader theme in Daniel of earthly kingdoms opposing God's people, a motif that resonates with the apocalyptic literature's portrayal of the struggle between good and evil.<p><b>and return to his own land</b><br>After his campaigns and the imposition of his policies, Antiochus IV returned to his own territory. This return signifies a temporary withdrawal, as his actions set the stage for further conflict and resistance from the Jewish people. The cyclical nature of his campaigns and returns highlights the ongoing tension between the Seleucid Empire and the Jewish nation, a theme that is echoed in the broader narrative of Daniel, where earthly powers rise and fall under divine sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the northern territories relative to Israel, historically interpreted as a Seleucid king, possibly Antiochus IV Epiphanes, known for his campaigns against Egypt and his persecution of the Jewish people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_land.htm">His Land</a></b><br>The homeland of the king of the North, likely the Seleucid Empire, which covered parts of modern-day Syria and surrounding regions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_wealth.htm">Great Wealth</a></b><br>The spoils and riches acquired by the king during his military campaigns, which he brings back to his kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_covenant.htm">The Holy Covenant</a></b><br>This refers to the covenant between God and His people, Israel.

Earlier verses describe his advances into Egypt, but verse 27 leaves him in a diplomatic stalemate.

Antiochus seized Egyptian riches and likely levied heavy tribute.

The verse reassures believers that even ruthless kings fulfill God&#8217;s prophetic script, underscoring both the literal reliability of Scripture and the Lord&#8217;s sovereign care over His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Then shall he return.--</span>He returns, apparently bringing abundant spoils with him, and while on the journey sets his heart against the holy covenant.<p><span class= "bld">Great riches.</span>--The prophecy points distinctly to Antiochus after his return from Egypt.

The Peshitta differs only by omitting the last clause, which certainly seems a redundance. On his return from his Egyptian campaign, Epiphanes, we learn from 1 Macc. 1:20-23, plundered the temple of all its treasures. On the somewhat suspicious authority of 2 Macc. 4. some have referred to the report spread that Antiochus was dead, and that, taking advantage of this, Jason seized the city and drove Menelaus into the citadel; and that, bearing of this uproar, Antiochus, imagining that Judaea had revolted, retired from Egypt, and wreaked vengeance on Jerusalem, taking it by assault.
