Dreams were often considered a means of divine communication in the ancient Near East, and this aligns with other biblical instances where God communicates through dreams, such as with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-10</a> and Pharaoh in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. The setting of being in bed suggests a time of rest, which is often when God chooses to reveal significant messages, as seen in <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-16</a>.<p><b>I saw this come to pass</b><br>The phrase "come to pass" suggests a prophetic element, indicating that what Nebuchadnezzar saw was not just a dream but a revelation of future events. This aligns with the biblical theme of God revealing His plans to individuals, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where God reveals His plans to His prophets. The vision is not merely symbolic but has real implications for the future, particularly for Nebuchadnezzar and his kingdom.<p><b>There was a tree in the midst of the land</b><br>The tree is a central symbol in the vision and represents Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, as later explained in <a href="/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20-22</a>. Trees are often used in Scripture to symbolize strength, growth, and prosperity, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>. The location "in the midst of the land" suggests a position of prominence and centrality, indicating the significant influence and reach of Nebuchadnezzar's reign.<p><b>and its height was great</b><br>The great height of the tree symbolizes the vastness and power of Nebuchadnezzar's empire. In ancient cultures, tall trees were often seen as symbols of majesty and dominance. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where height signifies greatness, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>, which describes the Assyrian empire as a towering cedar. The height also foreshadows the pride and eventual downfall of Nebuchadnezzar, as pride often precedes a fall, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who is recounting his dream.

Here the single, dominant tree stands for Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s empire&#8212;public, impressive, and seemingly indispensable.<p>&#8226; Placement &#8220;in the midst&#8221; suggests that the king viewed himself as the axis of the world (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>); yet even a ruler in the middle of everything is still answerable to the God who planted him (<a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its height was great</b><p>&#8226; Great height signals unmatched influence and prosperity (<a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; At the same time, towering stature hints at looming judgment, for God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The theme recurs throughout <a href="/bsb/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>: the Most High sets up and brings down kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17, 37</a>). Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s greatness is real&#8212;yet it is on loan from God, who can prune or topple the tree at will (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10</a> opens a divinely sourced vision that God grants to a powerful but spiritually unsteady king. While Nebuchadnezzar lies in bed, the Lord unveils a literal scene: a majestic tree standing at the center of the land, soaring high above everything around it. The image celebrates genuine greatness yet simultaneously foreshadows the danger of pride. In a few compact lines, the Spirit highlights God&#8217;s sovereign communication, the king&#8217;s precarious position, and the immutable truth that every height reached by human hands remains subject to the Ruler of heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">A tree.</span>--For this symbol of majesty, comp. <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, &c. The dream of Cambyses (Herod. i. 108) was of a similar nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great</span>. The Septuagint is different here, "I was sleeping [on my couch], and behold a lofty tree springing out of the earth, and its appearance was great, and there was not another like to it." The words, "on my couch," are marked with an asterisk, denoting that they have been added, probably from Theodotion. There are indications here of a text slightly different from the Massoretic, even in the latter portion of the verse, where the LXX. and the Massoretic text come closest. Instead of <span class="accented">bega</span>,' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>), "in the midst of," the LXX. reading has been <span class="accented">saggeee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), "great." The last clause is most widely different from the Massoretic text; instead of "and the height thereof was great," we have, "and there was no other like it." It is not easy to imagine how the one reading grew from the other, <span class="accented">roomeh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>), "height," might easily be mistaken for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (demah), if <span class="accented">roomeh</span> were written defectively; but the rest of the clause cannot easily be explained The Massoretic text has a certain redundancy of meaning, which is suspicious. In this verse we are told the tree was "great;" the opening clause of the following says the tree grew; whereas the Septuagint, while asserting its loftiness, asserts also that it was "growing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). On the whole, we prefer the Septuagint, as it does not proceed to assert further that the tree "grew great." Theodotion, while in the latter portion of the verse agreeing with the Massoretic text, omits the introductory clause. The Pe-shitta is a briefer recension of the Massoretic text, "The vision in my couch was - a tree in the midst of the earth, the height great." The reference here may be, to the sacred tree of the Assyrians, the symbol of life, which is so perpetually introduced into the sculptures of Nineveh, and seen also in some Babylonian cylinders, especially in connection with royal <span class="accented">acts</span> of worship, in Lenormant ('La Magie,' p. 27) we find that a sacred tree - a conifer of some sort as seen by the sculptures - was supposed to have the quality of breaking the power of the seven <span class="accented">Maskim.</span> Whatever the origin of this belief, it seems to have passed into the faith of Assyria and Babylon, and to have so permeated them that Ezekiel (31) describes Assyria as a mighty cedar. To pass from the empire to its ruler was a specially easy step in regard to an Oriental monarchy, in which the state was the monarch, <span class="accented">in the midst of the earth.</span> This refers to the notion each nation had that their own was the middle point, or <span class="accented">omphalos</span>, of the world. Though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">gav</span>) meant originally really "back," not "middle," yet it is used of the furnace of fire in the preceding chapter, and the primitive meaning is entirely lost in the Targums. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In these visions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;ez&#183;w&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
