The concept of God revealing mysteries is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in Joseph's interpretation of dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a> and the revelation of divine mysteries in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>). It underscores the belief that true wisdom and understanding come from God alone.<p><b>and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>This highlights God's control over earthly kingdoms and His ability to communicate with pagan rulers. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was a powerful monarch, yet God chose to reveal His plans to him, demonstrating that God's purposes transcend national and religious boundaries. This act of revelation also serves as a testament to God's desire to make Himself known to all people, not just the Israelites.<p><b>what will happen in the latter days</b><br>The phrase "latter days" often refers to future events, particularly those concerning the end times or the Messianic age. In the context of Daniel, it points to the unfolding of God's plan for history, including the rise and fall of empires and the eventual establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This prophetic element is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>, which speak of God's ultimate plan for humanity.<p><b>Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these:</b><br>This introduces the specific content of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which Daniel is about to interpret. The mention of dreams and visions is significant in biblical literature, often serving as a medium for divine communication. Dreams were a common means by which God conveyed His will in the ancient Near East, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Pharaoh (Genesis 41) and the visions of the prophets. This sets the stage for the revelation of God's message to Nebuchadnezzar, which Daniel will articulate, demonstrating the fulfillment of God's promise to reveal mysteries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and wise man in the Babylonian court, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_in_heaven.htm">God in Heaven</a></b><br>The sovereign and omniscient God who reveals mysteries and has authority over all kingdoms and times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The powerful king of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to Daniel's involvement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel was held captive and served in the king's court, representing a place of exile and testing for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Nebuchadnezzar, which Daniel interprets, revealing future events and God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and reveals His plans according to His will.

Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these</span>. All the versions are at one with the Massoretic text to the beginning of the last clause, which begins a new sentence. This last clause is omitted in the Septuagint. The clause is pleonastic; therefore, seeing it is omitted by the Septuagint, we may consider it not genuine, but due to a case of doublet in the Aramaic copies. Some copies have the present clause here, without the opening clause of the next, and others without this, but having the opening clause of ver. 29. Then came a copyist, who, unable to settle which was the better reading, inserted both. <span class="accented">There is a God in heaven.</span> No nation in ancient times was so addicted to the study of the stars of heaven and to the future as were the Chaldeans. Here Daniel announces that the God of heaven, Jehovah, the God of oppressed Judah and conquered Jerusalem, was the God who ruled all the stars from which the Chaldeans derived the knowledge of the future they thought they had, and arranged for his own purposes all things that were coming upon the earth, and he could tell what no one on earth could do. And the reason of this he also makes plain - God had expressly sent the dream to Nebuchadnezzar in order that he might know what was to "be in the latter days." He, Nebuchadnezzar, was the first of the great imperial powers who ruled after Israel ceased to be so much a nation as a faith. After the Babylonian Captivity Judaism became a Church over against a heathen state. Hence to him with whom this new state of things began was this message given. It has exercised many why this revelation of the future was made to this heathen monarch. Yet we must remember that, though made directly to him, through his obstinacy, it arrived at the Prophet Daniel, for whom it was meant. Yet again, no one can read the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar and fail to observe how deep and unfeigned was his piety according to his light. He worshipped Merodach, and if, in his ascriptions of praise, we were to place "Jehovah" instead of "Merodach," these prayers and thanksgivings would appear almost as if borrowed from the Hebrew Psalter. God, who readeth the hearts of men, might well have seen such a heart in this conqueror that he might be honoured with a revelation. The phrase, "latter days," had a special reference in Jewish prophetic language to the times of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>); hence we may assume that this vision would stretch in its revelations on to the times of the kingdom which the Lord would set up. It is unscientific to press this as meaning the absolute last time, as does Hitzig. It is not the future generally, as Havernick. We must be led by the usage of prophetic literature. <span class="accented">Thy dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these.</span> This clause, as we have indicated, is probably one of two parallel readings. There is probably no distinction intended between "dream" and "visions of the head upon the bed." This is really to be regarded as a case of parallelism, in which one portion of the verse was balanced by the other. What shade of difference there is, is between the dream as a totality and the portions of it as seen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1441;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ram)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1297.htm">Strong's 1297: </a> </span><span class="str2">Highly, surely, however</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1463;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_383.htm">Strong's 383: </a> </span><span class="str2">Entity, as a, particle of affirmation, there is</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_426.htm">Strong's 426: </a> </span><span class="str2">God</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in heaven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;may&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
