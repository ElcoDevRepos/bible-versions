The broken horn represents the fall of a powerful leader, historically identified as Alexander the Great, whose empire was divided after his death. The four horns symbolize the four generals&#8212;Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy&#8212;who divided the empire among themselves. This division is consistent with historical accounts of the Hellenistic period following Alexander's death in 323 BC.<p><b>represent four kingdoms</b><br>The four kingdoms are the territories governed by the four generals. Cassander took control of Macedonia and Greece, Lysimachus ruled over Thrace and parts of Asia Minor, Seleucus established the Seleucid Empire in the Near East, and Ptolemy governed Egypt. This division is significant in biblical prophecy as it sets the stage for later events in the intertestamental period, including the rise of the Seleucid Empire, which plays a crucial role in the events leading to the Maccabean Revolt.<p><b>that will rise from that nation</b><br>The nation referred to here is the Greek Empire established by Alexander the Great. The rise of these four kingdoms from the Greek Empire is a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Daniel, demonstrating the accuracy of biblical prophecy. This division also highlights the transient nature of earthly power and the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>but will not have the same power</b><br>The phrase indicates that these four kingdoms, though significant, did not possess the same level of power or influence as the unified empire under Alexander. Historically, this is accurate as none of the successor states achieved the same level of dominance or cohesion. This serves as a reminder of the limitations of human power and the ultimate authority of God, who raises and deposes rulers according to His divine plan. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, which speaks of God's control over the rise and fall of kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and the author of the Book of Daniel, who receives visions and interpretations from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_broken_horn.htm">The Broken Horn</a></b><br>Represents the fall of a powerful king or kingdom, specifically Alexander the Great in historical context.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_horns.htm">The Four Horns</a></b><br>Symbolize the four kingdoms that emerged after the division of Alexander the Great's empire.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation.htm">The Nation</a></b><br>Refers to the Greek Empire, which was divided after Alexander's death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation given to Daniel concerning future events and the rise and fall of empires.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The vision in <a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a> reminds us that God is in control of the rise and fall of empires.

The text stresses replacement: what follows is a direct consequence of his fall.<p>- The vision highlights God&#8217;s sovereign hand: even the abrupt end of a brilliant ruler serves His larger purposes, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>represent four kingdoms</b><p>- History records that Alexander&#8217;s generals eventually carved the empire into four realms:<p>&#8226; Cassander controlled Macedonia and Greece.<p>&#8226; Lysimachus governed Thrace and much of Asia Minor.<p>&#8226; Seleucus took Syria and the vast eastern territories.<p>&#8226; Ptolemy ruled Egypt and parts of Palestine.<p>- <a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a> plainly equates the horns with &#8220;four kingdoms,&#8221; matching the pattern of horns = kings in <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that will rise from that nation</b><p>- All four successors spring from &#8220;that nation&#8221;&#8212;the Greek realm.

In this variation we find also Theodotion and the Peshitta agreeing. Jerome has "<span class="accented">ejus."</span> It is difficult to decide what is the true reading here. In the reading of the older versions the meaning is that these kings which should succeed Alexander should not be mighty. The reading of the Massoretic and Jerome implies a direct and natural comparison with Alexander the Great. As for the Greek versions, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is easily mistaken for <span class="greek">&#x3c9;</span> in uncial manuscripts. As for the Syriac, is apt to be added to of the third person, and produce the difference we find. While the Greek versions and Jerome render, "his nation" instead of "the nation," as in the Massoretic, the Peshitta follows the Massoretic , which is wrong here. The point of the contrast is that the kings that succeeded Alexander were not of his family. Certainly none of the <span class="accented">successors</span> of Alexander had an empire nearly so extensive as his. The only one that really even comes into comparison with the empire of Alexander is that of Seleucus Nicator. But not only had he neither European nor African dominions, he did not possess, save for a little while. Asia Minor, nor Palestine, nor India beyond the Indus at all. The Parthian Empire seen sprang up, and wrested from the Solenoid a large portion of their possessions east of the Euphrates. It can well be said, even of the empire of Seleucus, that it had not the power of that of Alexander the Great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The four [horns]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that replaced</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#7717;&#183;te&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
