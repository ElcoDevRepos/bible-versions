This event occurs in the Babylonian Empire, which had conquered Judah and taken many of its people captive. Daniel's reputation as a wise man and interpreter of dreams precedes him, as he had previously served under King Nebuchadnezzar. The summoning of Daniel highlights the desperation of the king, who seeks understanding of the mysterious writing on the wall. This moment underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the elevation of His faithful servants in foreign lands.<p><b>who asked him,</b><br>The king's inquiry indicates a recognition of Daniel's unique abilities. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings often relied on wise men and magicians for counsel, especially in matters of divine or supernatural significance. The king's direct questioning of Daniel shows a level of respect and urgency, as he seeks answers that his own advisors could not provide.<p><b>&#8220;Are you Daniel,</b><br>The king's question acknowledges Daniel's identity and past service. Daniel's name, meaning "God is my judge," is significant in the narrative, as it reflects his role as a conduit of divine judgment and revelation. This moment also serves to remind the reader of Daniel's consistent faithfulness to God despite his circumstances.<p><b>one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?</b><br>This phrase situates Daniel within the historical context of the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The reference to "my father the king" likely refers to Nebuchadnezzar, although Belshazzar was actually the son of Nabonidus. This reflects the common ancient practice of referring to predecessors as "fathers" in a dynastic sense. The mention of Judah emphasizes the fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah about the consequences of Israel's disobedience. Daniel's status as an exile also prefigures the ultimate redemption and restoration of God's people, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Jewish exile in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams and visions.

Here Belshazzar&#8217;s question sets the stage for Daniel to proclaim God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; The contrast is vivid: a trembling monarch versus a calm prophet who knows &#8220;the people who know their God will display strength&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a>b).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Are you Daniel"</b><p>&#8226; Belshazzar verifies identity, highlighting Daniel&#8217;s enduring reputation despite decades out of royal spotlight (cf. <a href="/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Name matters: &#8220;Daniel&#8221; means &#8220;God is my Judge,&#8221; a hint that judgment is about to fall on Babylon (<a href="/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Like believers today (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>), Daniel&#8217;s consistent witness makes him recognizable even in a hostile culture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?"</b><p>&#8226; Belshazzar stresses Daniel&#8217;s outsider status, perhaps to remind him of perceived inferiority (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>). Yet this &#8220;exile&#8221; now holds the divine answer the empire lacks&#8212;a reversal reminiscent of <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;My father&#8221; (likely &#8220;ancestor,&#8221; referring to Nebuchadnezzar) recalls past conquests, but also past revelations Nebuchadnezzar received (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).

That Belshazzar knew him by reputation is plain from the description given of him at the end of the verse: "which art of the children of the captivity of Judah."<p><span class= "bld">Art thou that Daniel</span>?--He calls him by his Hebrew name, so as to avoid one which sounded so much like his own. Daniel was now nearly ninety years of age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry? I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing; and I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom</span>. There is a great deal of rhetoric in this, and the attempt to restore the stately etiquette of the Babylonian court. The king is represented as repeating very much what his mother had told him. It is to be observed that, although the queen-mother - as the Massoretic text records her words - has not spoken a word of Daniel's origin, and implies that Belshazzar knew noticing of him, yet when he comes, Belshazzar addresses him as knowing who and whence he is. The suspicion that is engendered by the mere reading of the text as we have it is confirmed by a study of the Septuagint text, where these four verses shrink into very modest dimensions, "Then Daniel was brought <span class="accented">to</span> the king, and the king answered and said, O Daniel, art thou able to show me the interpretation of the writing? and I will clothe thee with purple, and put a gold chain about thy neck, and thou shalt have authority over a third part of my kingdom." The brevity of this, the utter want of rhetoric, not to speak of its dramatic verisimilitude to the speech of a man beside himself with terror, make it the more probable text. Condensation was rarely the work of a <span class="accented">falsarius</span>; he might omit statements that were antagonistic to some preconceived notion, or, if only a leaf or so remained of a parchment otherwise filled up, he might endeavour to utilize the space left him by putting down as much as he could of some work he valued. Then, in such a case, a copyist might really condense. But neither of these causes can explain the omission of the rhetorical passages here. We are compelled, then, to regard the text behind the Septuagint in this place <span class="cmt_word">as</span> the true Daniel. Theodotion, while on the whole agreeing with the text of the Massoretes, is briefer in some respects. There is one addition, the insertion of "magicians" between "wise men and "astrologers. This shows the process of the evolution of the Massoretic text. The Peshitta, though but little, if at all, later than Theodotion, is in yet closer agreement with the text of the Massoretes. Yet the Massoretic text shows certain peculiarities. The presence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, in the second personal pronoun, which was disappearing from Targumic, but is regularly found in Daniel, is to be observed. Further, there is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span> with the suffix of the first person, which is not Targumic, but is found in the Sindschirli inscription. In the Targums it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9</a>:34, Onkelos. Eastern Aramaic retained it, as may be seen in the Peshitta Version of the passage before us, and of that to which we have referred. This is another of the many slight indications which all point to the Eastern origin of the Book or' Daniel. It may be observed that we have not here <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tal'ti</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tal'ta</span>). This is regarded by Behrmann as <span class="accented">status empbaticus.</span> The king in his terror makes appeal <span class="accented">to</span> one who, perhaps, had been dismissed the court on suspicion of being opposed to the new dynasty. That dynasty had displaced and murdered Evil-Merodach, the son of Daniel's old master, and one who had shown himself specially favourable to the Jews. As the text of the Septuagint gives the narrative, we have the king eager to have his terrors laid, and, to lead this opponent, whom his father, if not also Neriglissatr, had displaced, and put in opposition to his rule, to look favourably on him, he mentions the reward he offers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
