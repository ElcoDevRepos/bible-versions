The disasters that befell Israel, including exile, were consequences of breaking the covenant. This highlights the importance of the Law as a foundational document for understanding Israel's relationship with God.<p><b>all this disaster has come upon us</b><br>The disaster refers to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. This exile was a direct result of Israel's persistent idolatry and failure to uphold the covenant. The historical context includes the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC by Nebuchadnezzar, which fulfilled the prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah.<p><b>yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God</b><br>Despite the calamities, the people had not genuinely repented or sought God's mercy. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God desires repentance and a return to Him. The phrase underscores the importance of seeking God&#8217;s favor through humility and prayer, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>.<p><b>by turning from our iniquities</b><br>Repentance involves a conscious decision to turn away from sin. The Hebrew concept of repentance, "teshuvah," means to return to God. This turning away from sin is a prerequisite for receiving God's forgiveness and favor, as emphasized in the prophetic calls to repentance throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and giving attention to Your truth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the need to heed God's word and commandments. "Your truth" refers to the divine revelation given to Israel, which includes the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The call to give attention to God's truth is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, which extols the virtues of God's word as a guide for righteous living.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian and Persian empires, known for his faithfulness to God and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_moses.htm">The Law of Moses</a></b><br>Refers to the first five books of the Bible, also known as the Torah, which contains the laws and commandments given by God to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which is experiencing disaster due to their disobedience and failure to repent.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disaster.htm">Disaster</a></b><br>The calamities and judgments that have come upon Israel as a consequence of their sins and failure to adhere to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>Daniel highlights that despite the disasters, Israel has not turned from their iniquities.

There had been plenty of external show of praying, as appears from Isaiah 1 and elsewhere, but these prayers were of no effect on account of their formalism.

On the phrase "make prayer," see <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth</span>. The LXX. renders "laws," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, "covenant," which is applied to the "Law" (<a href="/hebrews/9-20.htm">Hebrews 9:20</a>, quoting from <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>). Theodotion agrees in the main with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only in joining the first clause of the next verse to this. Ewald makes the prenominal suffix at the end of the verse third person, not second. The very awkwardness of the construction is an evidence in favour of the received reading, "As it is written in the Law of Moses." The passages referred to are those denoted previously (<a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.). <span class="accented">All this evil is come upon us</span> - the curses referred to there. <span class="accented">Yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God</span>; literally, <span class="accented">entreat the face.</span> The face being the sign of favour, "entreated not the favour of the Lord" would be really what is meant; therefore not quite as Ewald renders, "appeased not Jahve." <span class="accented">Understand thy truth.</span> Hitzig thinks here the reference is to God's faithfulness, either in promises or in threats. Keil objects to this, contending that <span class="accented">baamitheka</span> with the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;</span> cannot mean "faithfulness," but" truth." This is a mistake; the preposition might alter the significance of the verb it follows, but not that of the noun it governs. The truth is that the word here is extended to its fullest meaning, "God's supreme reality." God's being God implies necessarily that every word he utters of promise or threatening is true; veracity and faithfulness are equally involved in Jehovah being God. At the same time, from the connection it is the evil - the judgments - he had threatened that bulk most largely in the prophet's mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Just as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
