This phrase indicates his active engagement and attentiveness to the vision, a common theme in prophetic literature where the prophet is both a recipient and an interpreter of divine revelation. The context of this vision is during the reign of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, which situates it historically in the 6th century BC.<p><b>and trying to understand it</b><br>This highlights Daniel's human limitation in comprehending divine mysteries, a recurring theme in the book. Despite his wisdom and previous experiences with interpreting dreams, this vision's complexity challenges him. This struggle for understanding is echoed in other biblical texts, such as in the book of Revelation, where John also seeks understanding of his visions.<p><b>there stood before me one having the appearance of a man</b><br>The figure with a human appearance is often interpreted as an angelic being, possibly Gabriel, who is later explicitly named in the chapter. Angels frequently appear in human form in biblical narratives, serving as messengers of God.

The presence of an angelic figure connects to other scriptural instances, such as the angelic visitations to Mary and Joseph in the New Testament, emphasizing the continuity of divine communication throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.

Daniel desires to understand the meaning of this vision. From this we see that, at the time when this book was written, it was understood that prophets might be ignorant of the meaning of the revelations made to them. This is at variance with the assumption of even believing critics, that if a prophecy were given to a prophet, he must have understood the reference of the message. On the accuracy of this assumption, they found the rejection of any interpretation of a prophecy which sees more in it than the prophet could have seen. This latest critical date of Daniel is separated by approximately two centuries and a half from prophecy in actual existence in Malachi. The tradition of the conditions of the phenomenon would still be vital. The phrase before us probably means that Daniel applied the various Babylonian formulae to the dream, to find the interpretation , but, suspicious of them, he still continued his search. In answer to Daniel's search, there stood before him one having "the appearance of a man (<span class="accented">gaber</span>)" - an angelic being in human form. The H,.brew word translated "man" is <span class="accented">gaber</span>, which suggests the name given to the angel, "Gabriel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1840.htm">Strong's 1840: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was watching</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(bir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;z&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2377.htm">Strong's 2377: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sight, a dream, revelation, oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and trying to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">understand it,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#238;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_998.htm">Strong's 998: </a> </span><span class="str2">An understanding</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
