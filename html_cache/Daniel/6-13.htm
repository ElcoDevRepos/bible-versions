The context is a group of officials envious of Daniel's favor with King Darius. Their approach to the king reflects a calculated move to manipulate the king's authority against Daniel. This mirrors the tactics used by adversaries throughout biblical history, such as the Pharisees' approach to Pilate regarding Jesus.<p><b>Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah</b><br>Daniel's identity as an exile highlights his status as a foreigner in Babylon, yet he held a high position in the government. This reflects the broader narrative of God's people living in exile, maintaining faithfulness despite being in a foreign land. The mention of Judah connects to the historical context of the Babylonian captivity, which began in 605 BC when Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem.<p><b>shows no regard for you, O king</b><br>This accusation is designed to provoke the king's sense of authority and pride. It suggests that Daniel's loyalty to God is perceived as a direct challenge to the king's rule. This echoes the tension between divine and earthly authority seen throughout Scripture, such as in the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>.<p><b>or for the decree that you have signed</b><br>The decree, which prohibited prayer to anyone except the king for thirty days, was a legal trap set by Daniel's adversaries. The irrevocability of Medo-Persian laws is a historical fact, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. This reflects the unchangeable nature of certain laws, paralleling the unchangeable nature of God's laws.<p><b>He still makes his petition three times a day</b><br>Daniel's commitment to prayer, despite the decree, demonstrates his unwavering faith and discipline. This practice of praying three times a day is rooted in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>.
