This decision reflects the importance of personal conviction and faithfulness. Daniel's determination is reminiscent of <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where a choice to serve the Lord is emphasized. His resolve sets a precedent for believers to stand firm in their faith.<p><b>that he would not defile himself</b><br>The concept of defilement is rooted in the Jewish dietary laws found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a>. These laws were given to maintain the Israelites' holiness and separation from pagan practices. Daniel's concern was likely both religious and cultural, as consuming the king's food could imply participation in idolatrous practices or eating unclean foods.<p><b>with the king&#8217;s food or wine</b><br>The king's food and wine were likely offered to Babylonian gods, making them ceremonially unclean. This reflects the broader theme of maintaining purity in a pagan environment. The refusal to partake in the king's provisions can be seen as a type of Christ, who remained sinless and pure despite being in a world tainted by sin.<p><b>So he asked the chief official for permission</b><br>Daniel's approach is marked by wisdom and respect. Instead of outright rebellion, he seeks permission, demonstrating a balance between conviction and diplomacy. This approach aligns with <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, which encourages respect for authority while maintaining one's faith.<p><b>not to defile himself</b><br>Reiterating his commitment, Daniel's request underscores the importance of maintaining spiritual integrity. This phrase connects to <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls believers to be holy in all conduct.

Even in exile, he kept God&#8217;s standards (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The same determination is urged on believers today: &#8220;Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that he would not defile himself with the king&#8217;s food or wine.</b><p>The royal menu likely contained meats first offered to idols and wines poured out to pagan gods (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>). Eating would blur the line between covenant loyalty and cultural assimilation (<a href="/leviticus/20-24.htm">Leviticus 20:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel saw compromise for what it was&#8212;defilement, not diplomacy (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; He recognized small concessions lead to larger ones; if Babylon shaped his appetite, it could soon shape his allegiance (<a href="/proverbs/23-1.htm">Proverbs 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned His people that purity mattered even in diet (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-3.htm">Deuteronomy 14:3&#8211;21</a>), so Daniel treated that word as non-negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself.</b><p>Respectful courage shines here. Daniel does not riot or sulk; he appeals through proper channels, trusting God to sway the official (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience married to humility invites divine favor&#8212;&#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to live at peace with him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s faith sought a creative alternative, opening the door for the ten-day vegetable test (<a href="/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; His approach mirrors the apostles&#8217; later stance: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>), yet without needless offense (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a> shows a young believer who pre-decides to honor God, identifies compromise as spiritual pollution, and seeks a respectful path of obedience.

He feared that he might eat something that had been consecrated to idols. (See 1 Corinthians 8)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wins which he drank, therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself</span>. The Septuagint renders the first clause somewhat paraphrastically, "Daniel desired in his heart," led possibly to this by the more limited meaning assigned to "heart" in the psychology of ordinary Greek speech. Theodotion is, as usual, in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta, instead of "heart," has <span class="accented">r'ina</span>, "mind." As before noticed, the G reek versions here render <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5d2;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Jerome renders it <span class="accented">mensa</span> In the Syriac the word is present, as we before said. We have above indicated that it is possible that the original word was not <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, but <span class="accented">pathura.</span> In regard to the Massoretic text as compared with the Greek and Latin versions, it seems certain that <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, if belonging to the text, was only understood in the East - a phenomenon that would be intelligible if this chapter be a condensation and translation of an original Aramaic text, especially if the Aramaic were Eastern, not Western. An ancient feast had always the nature of a sacrifice. It was the case with the Jews: thus in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11, 12</a>, directions are given for sacrificing in the place which the Lord should choose, and they and all their household rejoicing. But if the place chosen were too far, then permission was given them to eat flesh, only they were to be careful not to eat with the blood. It was the characteristic of the classic nations all through their whole history, that the feast should be consecrated by the offering of something of it to the Deity. The immense probability was that this was the case also among the Babylonians. It may be that this consecration of the feast arose from the same justifiable religious feeling which leads us to ask a blessing on our meals. The habit of the African Church to celebrate the Lord's Supper at every supper, was probably connected with this offering to God of what the guests were about to partake. This fact, that every feast had the character of a sacrifice, might easily make these Hebrew youths refuse the royal dainties. So far as animal food was concerned, the careful directions as to not eating with blood made partaking of the feasts of the Babylonian monarch peculiarly liable to bring on them defilement. The fact that Evil-Merodach provided Jeconiah with a portion from his table, and that Jeconiah did not refuse it, does not necessarily militate against the early date of Daniel. Jeconiah probably was not as conscientious as those youths, and, on the other hand, Daniel's influence by this time may have arranged some consideration for Jewish scruples. It is certain that in 2 Maccabees 5:27 Judas and his brethren are represented as living in the mountains on herbs, after the manner of beasts, that they might not be defiled; but as there is nothing parallel to this in 1 Maccabees, we may dismiss the statement as probably untrue. So the whole idea of this action on the part of Judas and his nine companions may have arisen from the case recorded before us. It has all the look of a rhetorical addition to the narrative, and the differences of the circumstances were not such as would strike a rhetorical scribe; but as this abstinence appeared to add to the sanctity of these four Hebrew youths, would it not add to the sanctity of Judas also? 'In the Assyrian feasts the guests do not seem to have sat at one long table or several long tables, as is usual with us. The guests were divided into sets of four, and had provisions served to them, and it is to be observed that the youths before us would have exactly occupied one of those tables. The word used for "defile" (<span class="accented">ga'al</span>) occurs in Isaiah, Lamentations, Zephaniah, Malachi, Ezra, and Nehemiah. It is an Exilic and post-Exilic word mainly; the old priestly word <span class="accented">lama</span> had not disappeared - it is used in Haggai. It is to be observed that there is nothing about defilement in the Peshitta; it is not impossible that the word is a later addition, only its presence both in Theodotion and the Septuagint renders the omission improbable. There is nothing in the passage here which makes it necessary for us to maintain that the principle of action followed by those youths was one which was generally acknowledged to be incumbent on all Jews. It may simply have been that, feeling the critical condition in which they were placed, it was well for them to erect a hedge about the Law. There may even have been an excess of scrupulosity which is in perfect dramatic suitability to the age of the youths. Such abstinence may well have occasioned the regular abstinence of the Essenes, but this state-merit concerning Daniel and his friends can scarcely have originated from the Essene dietary. It has been noted, as a proof of Daniel's courtesy and docility, that he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. But to have refused the food provided by the king might have been construed as an insult to the king, and anything of that sort had swift and severe punishment meted out to it. Daniel's request was simply due to the necessities of the situation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1840.htm">Strong's 1840: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">resolved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
