These individuals were part of a class of magicians, astrologers, and diviners who held significant influence in the royal court. The reliance on such figures reflects the pagan practices of the time, where supernatural insight was sought from sources other than the God of Israel. This practice contrasts with the biblical teaching that true wisdom and understanding come from God alone (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><b>to read this inscription and interpret it for me</b><br>The inscription referred to here is the mysterious writing on the wall, which appeared during King Belshazzar's feast. This event is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting the limitations of human wisdom and the sovereignty of God. The inability of the wise men to interpret the writing underscores the theme that divine revelation cannot be understood through human means alone. This mirrors other biblical instances where God reveals mysteries that only His chosen servants can interpret, such as Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams (Genesis 41).<p><b>but they could not give its interpretation</b><br>The failure of the wise men to interpret the writing serves as a critique of the Babylonian reliance on human wisdom and occult practices. It emphasizes the futility of seeking understanding apart from God. This moment foreshadows the introduction of Daniel, a man of God who possesses the divine insight necessary to interpret the message. It also parallels the New Testament teaching that spiritual truths are discerned through the Spirit of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). The inability of the wise men highlights the distinction between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom that comes from God, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons /
