In the biblical context, Daniel is overwhelmed by the vision and the presence of this divine messenger. The term "your servant" indicates Daniel's recognition of his position before God and His messengers, a common theme throughout Scripture where prophets and faithful individuals acknowledge their servitude to God (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). The use of "my lord" shows respect and acknowledges the authority of the heavenly being, similar to how Abraham addressed the Lord in <a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>.<p><b>Now I have no strength,</b><br>Daniel's lack of strength is a physical manifestation of the overwhelming nature of the divine encounter. This is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals are physically affected by the presence of God or His angels, such as Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The experience of divine visions often left prophets physically weakened, highlighting the power and holiness of God compared to human frailty.<p><b>nor is any breath left in me.</b><br>The phrase indicates a complete depletion of energy and vitality, emphasizing the intensity of the spiritual experience. In the ancient Near Eastern context, breath was often associated with life and spirit (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), so the absence of breath signifies a profound impact on Daniel's being. This mirrors the reaction of other biblical figures who encountered the divine, underscoring the awe and fear that accompany such revelations. Theologically, it points to the need for divine strength and sustenance, as human strength is insufficient in the presence of God's glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and servant of God, known for his unwavering faith and integrity.

whether we should regard the prophet as declaring that awe deprived him of the power of breath, or he felt his consciousness so numbed as that he seemed to be without it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
