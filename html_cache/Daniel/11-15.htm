The "king of the North" is typically identified as Antiochus III, also known as Antiochus the Great. His kingdom was located in the region of modern-day Syria and extended into parts of Asia Minor. This historical context is crucial as it sets the stage for the ongoing conflict between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, which is often referred to as the "king of the South."<p><b>build up a siege ramp</b><br>Siege warfare was a common military tactic in the ancient Near East, involving the construction of ramps to breach city walls. Archaeological evidence from various ancient sites, such as Lachish, provides insight into these methods. The use of siege ramps indicates a well-planned military strategy aimed at overcoming fortified cities, reflecting the military prowess and determination of the Seleucid forces under Antiochus III.<p><b>and capture a fortified city</b><br>The fortified city likely refers to Sidon, a strategic location in the ongoing wars between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms. The capture of such a city would have significant military and political implications, demonstrating the shifting power dynamics in the region. This event is part of the larger narrative of the struggle for control over the territories of the former Alexandrian Empire.<p><b>The forces of the South will not stand</b><br>The "forces of the South" refers to the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, which was in a state of decline during this period. The inability of the Ptolemaic forces to withstand the Seleucid assault highlights the weakening influence of Egypt in the region. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of the prophetic vision of Daniel, where the balance of power shifts in favor of the North.<p><b>even their best troops will not be able to resist</b><br>This indicates the overwhelming strength and strategic advantage of the Seleucid army. Despite the Ptolemaic forces' efforts, including deploying their elite troops, they were unable to resist the advances of Antiochus III. This reflects the broader theme of divine sovereignty and the unfolding of God's plan as revealed in the prophetic visions of Daniel. The inability to resist also serves as a reminder of the limitations of human power in the face of divine prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the northern territories relative to Israel, historically understood as the Seleucid Empire.

Historically this fits Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire moving southward after earlier setbacks (see <a href="/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel had already forecast such resilience: &#8220;He will again raise a greater army than before&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a>).

The version of the LXX. is, "And the king of the north shall attack and turn his spears, and shall take the fortified city, and the arms of the King of Egypt shall stand with his rulers, and there shall not be strength in them to resist them." It is difficult to imagine what Hebrew text was before the translator when he rendered, "turn his spears." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in the first portion, and with the LXX. in the latter. The Peshitta rendering is not unlike the Massoretic, "And the king of the north shall come and shall lay ambuscades, and shall conquer strong fastnesses; and the arms of the south shall not stand, because there is not in them might to stand; and his chosen people shall not stand, because there is not might in them to stand." The Vulgate, as usual, is closest to the Massoretic. The reference here is most probably to the capture of Sidon, into which Scopas, the general of Ptolemy, had thrown himself after his defeat at Paneas. Other strongholds and fortified cities were of necessity taken at the same time. <span class="accented">The arms of the south shall not withstand</span>, <span class="accented">neither his chosen people.</span> Ptolemy sent several successive armies to relieve Sidon, but was unable to compel Antiochus to give up the siege. Finally Scopas had to surrender. <span class="accented">Neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</span> Egypt was to all appearance helpless; there was neither wisdom in their counsels nor valour in their arms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the North</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
