The "wonders" refer to the prophetic events described earlier in Daniel, including the tribulations and the ultimate deliverance of God's people. This inquiry highlights human curiosity and the desire for assurance of God's plan, echoing the disciples' question in <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> about the end times.

The &#8220;one&#8221; speaking is one of the angelic beings he mentioned in 12:5. Angels often dialogue in front of prophets to reveal God&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>). Their words are always reliable because they relay God&#8217;s exact message (<a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the man dressed in linen</b><p>This figure in linen was introduced earlier (<a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>). Linen signals purity and priestly service (<a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2-4</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>). His dazzling description in chapter 10 matches the glorified Christ seen by John (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>), so the speaker is addressing the pre-incarnate Son of God, the ultimate High Priest who mediates revelation to His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was above the waters of the river</b><p>Standing above the Tigris (<a href="/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>; 12:7) shows sovereign authority over the nations, often symbolized by waters (<a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>). The scene recalls the Red Sea crossing, where the LORD ruled the waters for Israel&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>), and Joshua&#8217;s Jordan miracle (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>).

Heaven itself shares the burden of waiting for God&#8217;s final justice. The question underscores that every period of trial has a fixed, God-appointed limit (<a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the fulfillment of these wonders?</b><p>&#8220;Wonders&#8221; points back to the astonishing events just announced:<p>&#8226; unparalleled distress and deliverance of Israel (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>)<p>&#8226; resurrection of the righteous and the wicked (12:2-3)<p>&#8226; final purification and reward (12:3, 10)<p>Jesus echoes these very wonders when He speaks of &#8220;great tribulation&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>) and the resurrection &#8220;at the last day&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>). Revelation unfolds the same sequence&#8212;tribulation, resurrection, kingdom (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; 20:4-6). The angel wants to know the duration until every promised detail is literally completed, emphasizing that prophecy moves toward a concrete, historical finish line (<a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a> records an angel asking the exalted, linen-clad Christ how long it will take for God&#8217;s end-time marvels&#8212;tribulation, deliverance, and resurrection&#8212;to reach their appointed conclusion. The question affirms that heaven anticipates the same literal fulfillment believers await, and it reassures us that every prophecy has a divinely fixed timetable that cannot fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And one said.--</span>The speaker is evidently one of the persons just mentioned, but the LXX. and St. Jerome suppose Daniel to address the man clothed in white linen, who is obviously the same person who has already spoken (<a href="/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>, &c.). The position which he occupies is striking. He appears <span class= "ital">"upon"</span> or (see margin) from above, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> hovering over the waters of the Tigris. If, as is frequently the case in the symbolical language of Scripture (see <a href="/context/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6-7</a>, <a href="/psalms/93-4.htm" title="The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea.">Psalm 93:4</a>), waters or streams are the emblems of nationalities, the Hiddekel will represent the Persian Empire, in the third year of which Daniel had this vision, and the position of the person implies his power to protect his people from all the assaults of the Persians. But at the same time, the remarkable word used for "river" recalls the Nile, and seems to be employed for the purpose of assuring the readers of the book that "He who smote the waters of the Nile" will restrain all earthly powers which war against His people.<p><span class= "bld">How long</span> . . . <span class= "bld">end.</span>--The end is that which has been frequently spoken of (<a href="/daniel/11-40.htm" title="And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.">Daniel 11:40</a> to <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>). The question asks, "How long will the end of these wonders continue? The end always appears to be at hand, yet it never comes. How long will this continue?" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> The Septuagint renderingis, "And I said" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> - "to one clothed in fair linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), which is above the water of the river" - the last five words being omitted from the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis - "When, then, shall the end be of these marvels which thou hast told me, and their purification?" The last clause, which does not represent anything in the Massoretic, is due to a confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, with which the next verse begins, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, as usual, closer to the Massoretic, "and he said to the man clothed in <span class="accented">baddin</span>, who was upon the waters of the river, When shall be the end of those marvels of which thou speakest?" Both the Greek versions insert "of which thou speakest." The rendering of the Peshitta differs slightly, "And they said" - a reading that one would be wishful to adopt if it had any probability in its favour - "to the man clothed in beautiful apparel, who was standing above the waters of the river, Until when shall the end of these things be?" The omission of "wonders" is to be observed. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint in making Daniel the speaker, "And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was standing over the waters of the river, When shall be the end of these marvels?" <span class="accented">And one said.</span> Aben Ezra makes this one of the two who spoke. This suggestion is the most natural, only the sentence is singularly abrupt, and favours the idea that there is an omission here. The LXX. and Vulgate, as we have seen, read, "I <span class="accented">said."</span> While the reading is an easy one, it is, as Professor Bevan remarks, against the analogy of <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>. <span class="accented">To the man clothed in linen.</span> This man is mentioned in <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, presumably Gabriel. <span class="accented">Which was upon the waters of the river.</span> The reference may be to <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>, where a voice comes to him from between the banks of the river Ulai. Here, not upon the waters of the river Tigris, but over them, was the appearance of the angel Gabriel. <span class="accented">How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> One difficulty that strikes one is that there are no wonders foretold. That the rulers of Syria should war against the possessors of Egypt was not a marvellous thing. Professor Bevan, who holds that the marvels referred to are the events foretold, quotes <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a> as a parallel instance, but, though marvels are there mentioned, such marvels that all the wisdom of the wise should fail, etc., yet here nothing is told of the nature of these marvels. Had there been visions of symbolic animals, as in the seventh and eighth chapters, we could have understood these things being spoken of as marvels. The probability, then, is heightened that there have been omissions as well as insertions here. The time contemplated is the end, when judgment and resurrection are passed.
