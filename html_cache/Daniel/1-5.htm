The royal food and wine symbolize the wealth and luxury of the Babylonian court, contrasting with the simpler diet of the Israelites. This provision was meant to ensure the captives' physical well-being and to entice them with the benefits of serving the king. The food and wine also represent a potential challenge to the Jewish dietary laws, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a>, which Daniel and his friends later address by requesting a different diet. This situation foreshadows the tension between maintaining faithfulness to God's laws and adapting to a foreign culture.<p><b>They were to be trained for three years,</b><br>The three-year training period reflects the thorough preparation required for service in the Babylonian court. This education likely included learning the language, literature, and customs of the Babylonians, as well as the study of astrology and other sciences. The duration of the training underscores the importance of the role these young men were to play in the king's service. This period of preparation can be compared to the time of testing and preparation seen in other biblical narratives, such as Joseph's time in Egypt or Moses' years in Midian.<p><b>after which they were to enter the king&#8217;s service.</b><br>Entering the king's service signifies the culmination of their training and the beginning of their roles as advisors or officials in the Babylonian empire. This service would place them in positions of influence, allowing them to impact the decisions of the king and the direction of the empire. The phrase also highlights the sovereignty of God, who places His people in strategic positions to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of Joseph, Esther, and Nehemiah.

This was no casual gesture. Nebuchadnezzar deliberately chose the diet, rhythm, and atmosphere for his new servants.<p>&#8226; Such a daily allotment meant:<p>&#8211; Dependence on the king for survival (compare <a href="/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29&#8211;30</a> where Jehoiachin received a daily ration from the Babylonian court).<p>&#8211; Subtle pressure to accept Babylonian culture and even its idolatrous associations; royal food would often be offered to pagan deities first (see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8211; A test of loyalty: &#8220;Whoever eats my bread has lifted up his heel against Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>) shows how table fellowship signifies allegiance.<p>&#8226; For Daniel and his friends, to eat or not to eat became a spiritual decision (v. 8). Their refusal echoes <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do not be conformed to this world.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s generosity was real, yet it carried a spiritual price tag. Daniel&#8217;s discernment recognized that physical sustenance is never neutral&#8212;&#8220;Whether you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were to be trained for three years</b><p>&#8226; The next phrase states, &#8220;They were to be trained for three years&#8221;. Babylon offered the finest education in language, literature, astronomy, and statecraft (v. 4).<p>&#8226; Key observations:<p>&#8211; Three years reflects intentional, thorough indoctrination, not a crash course. <a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a> notes that &#8220;Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,&#8221; showing previous precedents of God&#8217;s people learning in foreign courts.<p>&#8211; God is not opposed to education; He is opposed to compromise. <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a> records that Jesus &#8220;grew in wisdom,&#8221; underscoring that learning can honor God when truth is sifted from error.<p>&#8211; The length allowed God to prove His servants over time. Faithfulness over years&#8212;not moments&#8212;qualifies a believer (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; While curriculum and environment were Babylonian, identity and conviction remained Hebrew. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1&#8211;2</a> contrasts the blessed man who delights in God&#8217;s law with those who walk in the counsel of the wicked; Daniel models that blessed path inside a pagan classroom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After which they were to enter the king&#8217;s service</b><p>&#8226; Finally, the verse concludes, &#8220;after which they were to enter the king&#8217;s service&#8221;. Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s motive was clear: populate his administration with the best minds from the conquered nations.<p>&#8226; From heaven&#8217;s perspective, this placement fulfilled <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do you see a man skillful in his work?

Yet at every turn God enabled Daniel and his friends to live set apart&#8212;receiving knowledge, demonstrating excellence, and ultimately serving a human king without compromising devotion to the King of kings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">A daily portion.</span>--(Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/52-34.htm" title="And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.">Jeremiah 52:34</a>.)

It appears that Nebuchadnezzar was a man of far higher character than many Assyrian and Babylonian kings. We shall see, in the course of the boot, that his heart was fitted for the reception of Divine truth, and that in the end he was brought to know the true God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king</span>. The only thing to be noticed in the LXX. Version of this verse is the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken to mean "give a portion" - a meaning which seems to be implied in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>), hence the translation <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Further, the translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as in <a href="/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>. The mysterious <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (<span class="accented">path-bag</span>), translated "meat," has caused differences of rendering. The Syriac Peshitta transfers it. Professor Bevan speaks as if it were common in Syriac, but Castell gives no reference beyond Daniel. (Brockei-mann adds, Ephrem Syrus, Isaac Antiochenus, Bar Hebraeus). It is to be observed that the Syriac form of the word has <span class="accented">teth</span>, not <span class="accented">tan</span>, for the second radical. This is a change that would not likely take place had the Hebrew form been the original, whereas from the fact that <span class="accented">path</span> means in Hebrew "a portion," if the Hebrew were derived from the Syriac the change would be intelligible. It is confounded in <a href="/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">pathura</span>), "a table." It seems not improbable that both the LXX. and Theodotion read <span class="accented">pathura.</span> The word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> does not seem to have been known in Palestine; it does not occur in Chaldee, but does in Syriac. This is intelligible if the chapter before us is condensation from a Syriac original rendered into Hebrew: the word <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, being unintelligible, is transferred. The etymology of the word is alleged to be Persian, but on this assumption it is a matter of dispute what that etymology is. One derivation is from <span class="accented">pad</span> or fad, "father" or "prince," or <span class="accented">pat</span> or <span class="accented">fat</span>, idol,' and <span class="accented">bag</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;</span>), food; another is from <span class="accented">pati-bhagu</span>, "a portion." The question is complicated by the fact that in <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> we have in the K'tbib <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (bag), meaning "food." In that case <span class="accented">path-bag</span> would mean "a portion of food." The reading of the K'thib is not supported by the versions. In Daniel the word simply means "food," such as was supplied to the king's table. We see in the slabs from the palace of Kou-youn-jik the nature of a royal feast. Animal food predominated. We cannot avoid referring to a singular argumentative axiom implied in all the <span class="accented">discussions</span> on Daniel. Critics seem to think that when they prove that certain words in Daniel are Persian, they thus prove Daniel was written nearly a couple of centuries after the Persian domination had disappeared. <span class="accented">Of the wine which he drank.</span> It is to be noted that there is a restriction. The wine supplied was the wine which the king drank - wine of which an oblation had been offered to idols. In thus bringing up hostages at his own table, Nebuchadnezzar was following a practice which has continued down to our own day. The son of Theodore of Magdala was brought up at the court of our queen. It was the regular practice, as we know, in Imperial Rome. Sennacherib speaks of Belibus, whom he made deputy-king in Babylon, as brought up "as a little dog at his table" (Bellino Cylinder, Sehrader, vol. 2. p. 32, Engl, trans.). <span class="accented">So nourishing them three years.</span> This was the period during which the education of a Persian youth was continued. It is probable, as we have seen, that these youths were about sixteen or seventeen. At the end of three years they would still be very young. The grammatical connection of the word <span class="accented">legaddelam is</span> somewhat singular. The Septuagint reading probably had the first word in this verse in the infinitive also. This is more grammatical, as it brings the whole under the regimen of the opening clause of ver. 3. The force of the word before us is represented in "bringing up." The verb in its simple form means "to be strong," "to be great," hence in the intensive form before us, "to make great," "to bring up." <span class="accented">That at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span> "Standing before the king" means usually becoming members of the council of the monarch, but in the present instance this does not seem to be the meaning. They were to be presented before the king, and in his presence they were to be examined. They were, then, possibly to be admitted into the college of astrologers and soothsayers, but only in lowly grade. Irrespective of the fact that they would at the latest be twenty or twenty-one when this season of education was over, an(t, even making all allowance for Eastern precocity, this is too young an age for being a member of a royal privy council. But the next chapter relates an event which appears to be the occasion when they stood before the king, for they were not summoned with the wise men to the king's presence to interpret his dream. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
