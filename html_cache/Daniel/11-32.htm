He used charm and deceit to win over those who were already inclined to break their covenant with God. The "covenant" here refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. Flattery and manipulation are common tools of leaders who seek to undermine faithfulness to God, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This tactic is a warning against the seductive power of words that lead believers away from their commitments to God.<p><b>but the people who know their God</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between those who are swayed by deceit and those who remain steadfast. "Knowing God" implies a deep, personal relationship and understanding of His character and promises. This is reminiscent of the call to know God in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> and <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>. The emphasis is on an intimate knowledge that goes beyond mere intellectual assent, involving trust and obedience. Historically, this group is often associated with the Maccabees, who resisted Hellenistic influences and fought to preserve Jewish law and worship.<p><b>will firmly resist him</b><br>The resistance mentioned here is both spiritual and physical. The people who know their God are empowered to stand against the corrupting influence of the leader. This resistance is not passive but active, involving a commitment to uphold God's laws and principles. The Maccabean Revolt is a historical example of such resistance, where Jewish fighters stood against the imposition of Greek culture and religion. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament call for believers to resist the devil (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>) and to stand firm in the faith (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>).

Just as the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1&#8211;5</a> questioned God with enticing words, the coming tyrant in <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> uses winsome promises and half-truths to lure hearts away from steadfast devotion. Second Thessalonians 2:9&#8211;10 describes the same end-time dynamic: &#8220;The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by every kind of deception&#8230; because they refused the love of the truth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will corrupt</b><p>Flattery is not harmless; its goal is corruption&#8212;moral decay that starts inside and eventually shows outside. First Corinthians 15:33 warns, &#8220;Do not be deceived: &#8216;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8217;&#8221; Daniel portrays a real, historical king (Antiochus IV) who desecrated the temple, yet the language also foreshadows the future Antichrist, whose persuasive tactics will &#8220;lead many astray&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>). Corruption here means turning what was once consecrated into something common or even profane.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who violate the covenant</b><p>The ones most vulnerable are already leaning toward compromise. They &#8220;violate the covenant,&#8221; much like Israel in <a href="/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10</a>, &#8220;They failed to keep God&#8217;s covenant and refused to walk in His law.&#8221; They possess outward ties to the faith community but have inwardly drifted. <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> warns believers today: &#8220;See to it&#8230; that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.&#8221; Spiritual half-heartedness opens the door to deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But</b><p>That single word shifts the whole verse and shines a spotlight on the faithfulness of God amid human failure (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>, &#8220;But God, being rich in mercy&#8230;&#8221;). No matter how powerful the seducer, God preserves a remnant&#8212;and Scripture never leaves His people without hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people who know their God</b><p>Knowing God is more than cognitive assent; it is personal, covenantal intimacy (<a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>). Jesus defined eternal life as &#8220;that they may know You, the only true God&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). This knowledge produces discernment and courage. Like the Maccabees in history, or the three Hebrew youths in <a href="/bsb/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, those who truly know the Lord stand out in times of pressure. Second Timothy 1:12 captures their confidence: &#8220;I know whom I have believed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will firmly resist him</b><p>The phrase pictures an active stand, not passive survival. <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a> urges, &#8220;Take up the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground.&#8221; <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a> echoes, &#8220;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a> shows the victorious end: &#8220;They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.&#8221; The faithful do not rely on political power or sheer willpower; they overcome by clinging to truth, wielding Scripture, and maintaining uncompromised allegiance to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a> exposes two paths during seasons of intense deception. Those half-committed drift further through flattering lies, while those who genuinely know God grow bolder and take their stand. History verified the verse in Antiochus IV&#8217;s day, and prophecy points forward to a final Antichrist. Yet the unchanging lesson remains: cultivate a deep, personal knowledge of God, refuse every seductive compromise, and you will stand firm when the pressure mounts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Such as do wickedly.</span>--In these verses are traced the effects of the apostasy upon the people of God.

The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>, the preformative of the participle hiphil, has been taken for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. written defectively, and probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>. Theodotion does not require special notice, as his version here agrees closely with the Massoretic. The Peshitta is somewhat shorter and having a different significance, "And those who transgress against the covenant he shall condemn them. And the people who know the fear shall be strong." The Vulgate rendering is, "And the impious against the covenant shall feign falsely (<span class="accented">simulabunt fraudu-lenter</span>), but the people knowing their God shall possess and do (exploits)." Men like Alcimus, the high priest after Menelaus, were transgressors of the sacred covenant, and were corrupted by the flatteries of Epiphanes. He used them to gain the people over to his views. <span class="accented">But the people that do know their God shall be strong</span>, <span class="accented">and do exploits.</span> Even when Epiphanes seemed most nearly successful, there was a deep-seated opposition to this Hellenizing process. Especially prominent were those who were zealous for the Law, the <span class="accented">Hasidim</span>, or, to give them the name they have in the Book of Maccabees, the Assidseans. These religionists, headed by Mattathias and his sons, especially by the heroic Judas Maccabaeus, certainly knew their God, and as certainly did exploits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">With flattery</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;laq&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
