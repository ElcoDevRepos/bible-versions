The king's role as a watcher highlights his authority and the divine revelation he is about to receive. In the ancient Near East, kings were often seen as intermediaries between the gods and people, making Nebuchadnezzar's dream significant for both his reign and the broader narrative of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<p><b>a great statue appeared</b><br>The appearance of the statue in the dream signifies a divine message. Statues in ancient cultures often represented deities or rulers, symbolizing power and authority. This particular statue is a prophetic symbol, representing successive world empires. The use of a statue, a common object of worship in Babylon, underscores the contrast between human power and divine sovereignty.<p><b>A great and dazzling statue stood before you</b><br>The description of the statue as "great and dazzling" emphasizes its impressive and intimidating nature. This reflects the grandeur and might of the empires it represents. The statue's presence before the king suggests the immediacy and relevance of the vision to Nebuchadnezzar's reign and the future of his kingdom. The dazzling aspect may also imply the allure and deceptive nature of earthly power.<p><b>and its form was awesome</b><br>The awe-inspiring form of the statue indicates the overwhelming power and influence of the empires it symbolizes. This phrase can be connected to the biblical theme of the fear of the Lord, as true awe should be directed towards God rather than human constructs. The statue's form, while awesome, is ultimately temporary and subject to God's eternal kingdom, as later revealed in the interpretation of the dream.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to Daniel's involvement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and wise man in the Babylonian court who interprets the king's dream through divine revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, representing the height of ancient Near Eastern power and culture.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_statue.htm">The Great Statue</a></b><br>A symbolic figure in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, representing successive world empires, starting with Babylon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Nebuchadnezzar, which Daniel interprets, revealing God's sovereignty over human kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The dream and its interpretation highlight that God is in control of history and the rise and fall of empires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_power.htm">The Transience of Earthly Power</a></b><br>The statue's composition of different materials signifies the temporary nature of human kingdoms compared to God's eternal kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_revelation.htm">The Role of Divine Revelation</a></b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream underscores the importance of seeking God's wisdom and revelation in understanding our world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Daniel's faithfulness in a foreign land serves as a model for believers living in a world that often opposes God's values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_ultimate_kingdom.htm">Hope in God's Ultimate Kingdom</a></b><br>The prophecy points to the establishment of God's everlasting kingdom, offering hope and assurance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_31_God_s_rule_over_kingdoms.htm">How does Daniel 2:31 demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and rulers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_from_Daniel_s_dream_interpretation.htm">What can we learn about God's revelation through Daniel's interpretation of the dream?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_statue_s_link_to_future_prophecy.htm">How does the statue in Daniel 2:31 connect to future biblical prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_control_in_daily_life.htm">How should understanding God's control in Daniel 2:31 affect our daily trust in Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Steps_to_align_with_God_s_kingdom.htm">What practical steps can we take to align with God's kingdom, as shown in Daniel 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_31_God_s_rule_over_kingdoms_2.htm">What does Daniel 2:31 reveal about God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms?

The verse urges every reader to look past dazzling human glory and stand in reverent awe of the God who reveals mysteries and rules history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">A great image.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">one great image.</span> This is one important feature in the vision. The image, though representing many things, was itself only "one." (See Note on <a href="/daniel/2-1.htm" title="And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.">Daniel 2:1</a>.) That the image was of human form is evident from the further descriptions of the various parts of the body given in <a href="/context/daniel/2-32.htm" title="This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,">Daniel 2:32-33</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-42.htm" title="And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.">Daniel 2:42</a>. The "greatness" of the image implies the magnificence and size of it. As will be shortly seen, throughout the various parts it represented the many complex phases of the one history of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible</span>. The Greek versions do not require notice, as they do not imply any difference in reading from the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is shorter, "Thou, O king, wert seeing, and, lo! a great image of beauty exceeding excellent, and it stood before thee." The opening clause of the next verse may be regarded as taking up the last clause of the verse before us. As to the Aramaic of the passage, it is to be observed that the s, me long form of the second person is used in ver. 29. The numeral <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">had</span>) is used in this verse very much in the sense of the English indefinite article which is used to translate it in the English versions. It is represented in the Greek Version by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">ulu</span>)," behold," does not occur in the Targums; a cognate form occurs in Samaritan, <span class="accented">hala.</span> In Talmudic it occurs in a form like the Samaritan. This word occurs in ch. 7, varied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">aru</span>), which is regarded as a phonetic variation. It may, however, be due to defective penmanship, having the top of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> too faintly written. Its etymology is doubtful. No Assyrian root has been found from which it may be derived. The word for "image," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">tzelem</span>), occurs in the Palmyrene inscriptions, as the regular term for a memorial statue. Hence, unless reason can be shown to the contrary, we could assume, even though there had been no more, that the figure was like a statue of a man. The word for this, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>), occurs only in Daniel; the corresponding word in Ezra is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The n sound is one that so readily slips away, that its presence as a final letter is a sign that the form of a word possessing it is in an older stage than that without it; hence we would argue that as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>) is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">da</span>) of the Targums, so <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>) of Daniel is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The word that is most interesting is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">ziveh</span>); it is rendered "brightness" in our version. It is recognized by Professor Bevan, on the authority of Delitzsch, as an Assyrio-Babylonian word, therefore affording an additional evidence of the Eastern origin of Daniel. Noldeke would derive it from the Persian <span class="accented">zeb</span> (quoted by Behrmann, but there is some mistake in his reference). This tendency to derive everything from the Persian is to be suspected. The long political connection between Babylon and the Aryan nations north and east of it might easily introduce words of such an origin into the writings of a Babylonian diplomat. Another derivation is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zahah</span>), but seems doubtful, as, although in Hebrew, there is no trace of such a verb in Aramaic. The only other word that merits note is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">reve</span>), "appearance." Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span> it is the only appearance in Aramaic of a corresponding root to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">ra'ah</span>), "to see." Daniel, it will be seen, lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the emotions which each feature excited, in order to recall, not only the dream, but something of the feelings with which Nebuchadnezzar had beheld it. With this dream of Nebuchadnezzar we might compare the dream of the seer of Asshurbanipal, given by Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 137), "The seer (<span class="accented">voyant</span>) narrated to Asshurbanipal how the goddess Istar had stood before him seated in her chariot, surrounded by flame, with a bow in her hand" (see also Smith's 'Assurbanipal,' pp. 123. 124). It is unlikely that the colossal image was identified by Nebuchadnezzar with any one of the Babylonian gods; perhaps this was one of the elements of the terror excited by the vision, that he could not identify him. If he did make any identification, Daniel does not do anything to justify him in any such identification. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1514;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ant)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_607.htm">Strong's 607: </a> </span><span class="str2">You </span><br /><br /><span class="word">O king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were watching,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;z&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2370.htm">Strong's 2370: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze upon, mentally to dream, be usual</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2298.htm">Strong's 2298: </a> </span><span class="str2">As card, one, single, first, at once</span><br /><br /><span class="word">great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;ag&#183;g&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7690.htm">Strong's 7690: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, much</span><br /><br /><span class="word">statue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;l&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6755.htm">Strong's 6755: </a> </span><span class="str2">An idolatrous figure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">appeared.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
