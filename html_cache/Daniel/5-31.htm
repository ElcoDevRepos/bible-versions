Some scholars suggest he may be a title for Gubaru, a governor under Cyrus the Great, or possibly another name for Cyrus himself. The Medes were an ancient Iranian people who, along with the Persians, formed the Medo-Persian Empire. This transition of power from Babylon to the Medes and Persians fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a>, where a kingdom inferior to Babylon would arise.<p><b>received the kingdom</b><br>The phrase indicates a transfer of power, marking the end of the Babylonian Empire and the beginning of the Medo-Persian rule. This event is historically significant as it represents the fulfillment of God's judgment against Babylon, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>. The fall of Babylon is also a demonstration of God's sovereignty over nations, as He raises and deposes kings according to His will (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><b>at the age of sixty-two</b><br>The specific mention of Darius's age underscores the historical nature of the account, providing a detail that situates the narrative in a real-world context. This detail may also highlight the wisdom and experience of Darius as a ruler, suggesting that he was well-prepared to govern the newly acquired kingdom. The age of sixty-two could also symbolize a mature and established leadership, contrasting with the youthful arrogance of Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius_the_mede.htm">Darius the Mede</a></b><br>A ruler who took over the kingdom after the fall of Babylon.

(See <span class= "ital">Excursus D.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Took</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> received it from the hands of a conqueror. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>, where Darius is said to have been "made king over the realm of the Chaldeans.")<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS D: DARIUS THE MEDE (Daniel 5:31).</span><p>It appears from the account given by Daniel that Darius the Mede was the sovereign appointed to rule over Babylonia after the death of Belshazzar. Cyrus, after the capture of Babylon, appointed a man named Gubaru (Gobryas) as his governor at Babylon. Can he and Darius the Mede be the same person? It is impossible to identify Darius with any personage mentioned in profane history, and hitherto no traces of any such name have been found in Babylonian inscriptions belonging to this period. Till time or circumstances shall give further information, we must maintain that a book like Daniel's, which is correct on many minor points, cannot fail to be accurate upon the subject of Darius.<p>Difficulties were experienced at a very early time in reference to this subject. The LXX., assuming that Ahasuerus (<a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>) was Xerxes, identified him with Artaxerxes. The opinion of Josephus is that Darius (<span class= "ital">Antt.</span> x. 11, ? 4) and his kinsman Cyrus destroyed the supremacy of Babylon; and at the fall of the capital, this Darius, son of Astyages, took Daniel with him to Media, and placed him in an exalted situation. St. Jerome agrees to this relationship between Cyrus and Darius. St. Ephraim is silent; but Theodoret goes further, and identifies Darius with Cyaxares, son of Astyages. In modern times the identity of Darius with Cyaxares II. has been strongly maintained, though without paying sufficient attention to the very slight evidence in favour of the existence of the latter. The identification of Darius with Astyages has an obvious refutation, for in B.C. 536 Astyages would have exceeded the age ascribed to Darius by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>).<p>It is evident from history that Cyrus was the immediate conqueror of Babylon, and that no Median Empire came between the Babylonian and the Persian Empires. It is also clear that Daniel regards Darius as one who "received the kingdom" (<a href="/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>), and who "was made king" (<a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>). If the word Darius means "a maintainor," all that is mentioned in this chapter amounts to no more than the statement that a Median governor took the kingdom." How. ever, the use of the word (<a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>) requires the name of a person rather than an office. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old</span>. It is probable that the Massoretic division of the chapters here is to be preferred. According to it, this verse is assigned to the begining of the next chapter, but most of the more ancient versions, Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate, agree with our English arrangement. The Septuagint, like the Massoretic text, assigns this verse to the sixth chapter. Its rendering manifests several striking peculiarities, "And Artaxerxes of the Medes received (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">the</span> kingdom, and Darius was full of days, and reverend (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in old age." This is the product of doublets <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;</span>, Artaxerxes, being suggested by some scribe as in his opinion a more probable name than Darius. So the one name begins the first clause, and the other the second. The last clause is evidently due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kebar</span>), "about" ("as the son of"), being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kaber</span>), "great," "multiplied" - a meaning this word has in Syriac, but not in Chahlee (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The uncertainty as to the name has to be noted. We shall reserve for fuller discussion the question of Darius the Mede, only we would say that the name not improbably was modified from a less-known name to one somewhat like it but well known. We know that "<span class="accented">Go-baru</span>," or "<span class="accented">Oybaru"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> "Gobryas," in Greek - was appointed governor by Cyrus when he conquered Babylon, and that, in the script of the Sindschirli monuments, <span class="accented">Gobryas</span>, or . is not unlike <span class="accented">Darius</span>. One point to be noted is the fact that the verb used is wrongly translated "took." really means "received." When this is said, we naturally expect some one, either God or man, from whom he has received this honour. If this purported to be a history of Babylonia, then it might be reasoned that the implied source from whom the kingdom was received was God; in such a case <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> would be used of one who succeeded to the kingdom by inheritance; this cannot be the meaning here. In this passage it is merely incidentally mentioned in order to explain the events that immediately follow. The more natural interpretation is that he was put on the throne by another person, his superior. The instance quoted by Professor Bevan, in which this verb is used of the accession of Julian the Apostate, tells really against his contention. Julian expected to have to conquer the empire: but, by the death of his cousin, he received it as an inheritance. Nothing could be more unlike what occurred in Babylon, according to his theory of what the author of Daniel meant. He maintains that the author of Daniel thought Darius conquered Babylon, and so ascended the throne. The example he brings does not show that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> could be used in that sense. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Darius</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1433;&#1493;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;we&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1868.htm">Strong's 1868: </a> </span><span class="str2">Darius -- two person kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Mede</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1491;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;&#8234;&#8236;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">received</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(qab&#183;b&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6902.htm">Strong's 6902: </a> </span><span class="str2">To acquire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the kingdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#7733;&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4437.htm">Strong's 4437: </a> </span><span class="str2">Royalty, reign, kingdom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the age</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1247.htm">Strong's 1247: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son, grandson</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of sixty-two.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;it&#183;t&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8361.htm">Strong's 8361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sixty</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/5-31.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 5:31 Darius the Mede received the kingdom being (Dan.
