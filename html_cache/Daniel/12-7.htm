Linen is associated with purity and holiness, indicating the divine nature of the messenger. This figure is reminiscent of the man in linen seen in <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>, who is described with a dazzling appearance, suggesting a connection to divine revelation.<p><b>who was above the waters of the river</b><br>The location above the waters of the river suggests a position of authority and control over chaos, as water often symbolizes chaos in biblical literature. This imagery is similar to the Spirit of God hovering over the waters in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. The river, likely the Tigris, is a significant geographical feature in the region, emphasizing the importance of the vision's setting.<p><b>raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven</b><br>Raising both hands toward heaven is a gesture of solemn oath-taking, indicating the seriousness and certainty of the message being delivered. This act of swearing by heaven is a powerful affirmation of the truth of the prophecy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, where God Himself raises His hand to heaven.<p><b>and I heard him swear by Him who lives forever</b><br>Swearing by "Him who lives forever" underscores the eternal nature of God, who is the ultimate authority and witness to the oath. This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and unchanging nature, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>, where a similar oath is made by an angel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;It will be for a time, and times, and half a time.</b><br>The phrase "a time, and times, and half a time" is a cryptic expression often interpreted as a period of three and a half years. This timeframe is significant in apocalyptic literature, appearing in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>, symbolizing a period of tribulation and testing for God's people. It reflects the idea of a divinely appointed period of suffering that will ultimately lead to deliverance.<p><b>When the power of the holy people has finally been shattered</b><br>The shattering of the power of the holy people refers to a time of intense persecution and suffering for the faithful. This concept is echoed in <a href="/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>, where the persecution of the saints is described. The breaking of their power signifies a period of testing and purification, aligning with the theme of refining and purifying God's people found throughout scripture.<p><b>all these things will be completed.&#8221;</b><br>The completion of "all these things" points to the fulfillment of God's prophetic plan. This phrase indicates that the trials and tribulations faced by the holy people are part of a larger divine purpose that will culminate in the establishment of God's kingdom. It echoes the assurance found in <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>, where the prophecy outlines the ultimate redemption and restoration of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_clothed_in_linen.htm">The Man Clothed in Linen</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as an angelic being or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. He is described as being above the waters, symbolizing authority and purity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waters_of_the_river.htm">The Waters of the River</a></b><br>The river is often seen as a symbol of chaos or the nations. The man standing above it signifies dominion over these elements.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/raising_hands_toward_heaven.htm">Raising Hands Toward Heaven</a></b><br>This gesture is a solemn oath, indicating the seriousness and certainty of the message being delivered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/him_who_lives_forever.htm">Him Who Lives Forever</a></b><br>This refers to God, emphasizing His eternal nature and sovereignty over time and events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/time,_times,_and_half_a_time.htm">Time, Times, and Half a Time</a></b><br>This phrase is a prophetic period often interpreted as three and a half years, symbolizing a period of trial or tribulation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/certainty_of_god's_plan.htm">Certainty of God's Plan</a></b><br>The raising of hands and the oath signify the absolute certainty of God's prophetic timeline. Believers can trust in God's sovereignty and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_through_tribulation.htm">Endurance Through Tribulation</a></b><br>The period of "time, times, and half a time" suggests a finite period of suffering. Christians are encouraged to endure, knowing that trials have an end.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The man above the waters symbolizes God's control over the chaos of nations. Believers can find peace in God's ultimate authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_shattering_of_power.htm">The Shattering of Power</a></b><br>The shattering of the holy people's power indicates that human strength is insufficient.

Linen in Scripture consistently points to purity and priestly service (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The appearance of this majestic messenger underscores that God&#8217;s revelation comes through holy, trustworthy means. His presence links Daniel&#8217;s final vision to earlier chapters, assuring continuity in God&#8217;s prophetic program.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who was above the waters of the river</b><p>The messenger stands &#8220;above the waters of the river,&#8221; the same Tigris Daniel mentioned in 10:4. Elevated above the current, he pictures sovereignty over the nations often symbolized by restless seas (<a href="/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>).

(See <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the man clothed in</span> <span class="cmt_word">linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> The Septuagint essentially agrees with this. It omits "man" in the first clause; has "water" instead of "waters;" adds "God" as explanatory of "him that liveth for ever;" it renders "scatter the power" by "loose the hands." Theodotion, while agreeing with the Massoretic text as to the first portion of the verse, differs very much in the end. He renders, "when the scattering is finished, they shall know these things." There is, as will be seen, no reference to the "holy people." His manuscript must have omitted "holy," for the rest may be explained by a false division into words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;</span> The Massoretic reading is to be preferred. The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remark. <span class="accented">When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven.</span> The lifting up the hand, in sign of making a solemn asseveration, is used of God himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>), of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>), of the angel in the passage in Revelation founded on this (<a href="/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>). Here the fact that both right hand and left hand are lifted up to heaven gives greater solemnity to the act. <span class="accented">And sware by him that liveth for ever.</span> This title is ascribed to God in <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a> (31); also in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; the idea is involved in the name Jehovah (Yahveh). The relationship between the oath and the ascription to God, on whose faithfulness its fulfilment depended, is obvious, The fact that the "man clothed in linen" thus "swears" implies that in some way he is the source of the determination of the period. This notion is involved in the whole spiritual scenery of the Book of Daniel; the angels of the nations are the agents under God for carrying out the decrees of providence. <span class="accented">That it shall be for a time</span>, <span class="accented">times</span>, <span class="accented">and an half.</span> This is a space of time repeatedly used in the Biblical apocalypses (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). In <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>, the same period seems to be represented by twelve hundred and sixty days. In the present case twelve hundred and ninety days seem to be regarded as equivalent to the "time, times, and an half (ver. 11). The divergency of interpretation comes to its height here. A great number of interpreters - not merely those of the critical school - maintain that "time" here is a literal year, and the days of the succeeding verses literal days, and that the period in question is that between the desecration of the temple by Antiochus's orders, and the setting up "the abomination of desolation" (1 Macc. 1:54), till the Jews were able to sacrifice once more in the re-consecrated temple (1 Macc. 4:52). This period, however, is only ten days over the three years from the 15th Casleu, 145 of the era of the Seleucids, to the 25th Casleu, 148. Or, if we take the date from the time that sacrifices to Jupiter began, till the re-establishment of the worship of Jehovah, it is then exactly three years from the 25th Casleu to the 25th Casleu. This period is not sufficient. Professor Moses Stuart gets over the difficulty by reckoning back from the cleansing of the temple to what he consider, the probable date of Antiochus's entrance into Jerusalem on his retreat from Egypt. This, however, is arbitrary, as the eleventh verse makes the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> the setting up of the "abomination of desolation," which occurred in 145, Seleucid era. Professor Bevan would reckon to the death of Antiochus. Of this event we only know it happened in 149, Seleucid era (1 Macc. 6:16). If the year began, as the Maceabaean reckoning seems to have been, with the month Nisan, it might be that approximately three years and a half was the time from the desecration of the temple to the death of Anti-ochua But the death of Antiochus produced but little change on the condition of the Jews. In the following year Lysias inflicted a defeat on Judas and besieged Jerusalem, and captured a portion of the city. To some extent we have anticipated our remarks on this text when considering <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. There are, however, peculiarities due to the fact that Aramaic, not Hebrew, is the language used in that passage. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">mo'ed</span>), here rendered "time." is translated "congregation" most generally in the Peutatcuch. Sometimes it is "feast," and sometimes it is "season;" but if the word here means a definite period of time, it is the only case in which it does so, and it is a word that appears several hundreds of times in the Scriptures. We admit that the enumeration of days which follows renders the assertion that <span class="accented">mo'ed</span> means here a "year," to some extent plausible, yet only plausible. But the next question arises - Even though we should grant that it means a year, are we to understand a literal year? We saw that the "weeks" of ch. 9. are not to be taken literally, but as weeks of years, in which each day stands for a year; the contention of the traditional interpreters has then a justification from analogy in taking a <span class="accented">mo'ed</span>, if a "year," to be one of three hundred and sixty or three hundred and sixty-five years. Not only is the extent of time indicated here extremely doubtful, but the <span class="accented">terminus a qao</span> is also. Although the writer of 1 Maccabees fixes the setting up the abomination of desolation, that is only his interpretation. Our Lord, on the other hand, refers it to the Roman conquest of Jerusalem, which was a vastly more thorough destruction than that inflicted by Antiochus. The meaning of this period is not fixed yet. <span class="accented">When he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people.</span> Professor Bevan would change the reading here, as from the order of the Greek words in the Septuagint he deduces that the order in the text before the translator was different from that in the Massoretic text. He would render, "When the power of the shatterer of the holy people shall come to an end." Behrmann sees grammatical difficulties, but these are not cogent; but the argument for this change is weak. Yet we prefer, though with difficulty, Professor Bevan's reading. It makes the connection much simpler to take this solution, as the end of all things is not the scattering of the holy people, but their building up. If we had any authority from the versions we should be inclined to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and thus would wish to render, "From the breaking of the power of the scatterer of the holy people till all these things are ended." This gives beth <span class="accented">termini</span>, but none of the versions gives any hint of such a reading. <span class="accented">All these things shall be finished.</span> As the resurrection is mentioned in the second verse, we might at once assume that this refers to the end of time; but <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>, compared with 30, renders this conclusion doubtful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/12-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;
