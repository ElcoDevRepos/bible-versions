This reflects the king's suspicion and distrust of his advisors, highlighting the absolute power and authority he wielded. The "one decree" refers to the severe punishment awaiting the wise men if they fail, emphasizing the high stakes and the king's impatience. Historically, Babylonian kings were known for their harsh decrees, and this aligns with the autocratic rule typical of ancient Near Eastern monarchies.<p><b>You have conspired to speak before me false and fraudulent words,</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar accuses his advisors of conspiracy, suggesting they might fabricate an interpretation to appease him. This accusation underscores the tension between the king and his court, reflecting a broader theme of human wisdom versus divine revelation. The king's distrust may also indicate his awareness of the limitations of human wisdom, setting the stage for God's superior knowledge to be revealed through Daniel.<p><b>hoping the situation will change.</b><br>The phrase suggests that the wise men were stalling for time, perhaps hoping the king would forget the dream or that circumstances would shift in their favor. This reflects a common human tendency to delay facing difficult truths or decisions. In a broader biblical context, it highlights the futility of relying on human schemes instead of seeking divine guidance.<p><b>Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can give me its interpretation.&#8221;</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's demand for both the dream and its interpretation serves as a test of authenticity. This insistence on proof reflects a desire for certainty and truth, which can only be provided by divine intervention. Theologically, this sets the stage for Daniel's role as a prophet who reveals God's wisdom. It also prefigures Christ, who embodies truth and reveals the mysteries of God. This moment foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's kingdom, as Daniel's interpretation will later unveil the future of earthly kingdoms and the coming of God's eternal reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that he demanded his wise men interpret without revealing the dream itself.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew captive in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams through God's revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A group of wise men, astrologers, and magicians in Babylon who were unable to fulfill the king's demand.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where these events take place, known for its grandeur and as a center of power and culture during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A mysterious vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, which none of his wise men could interpret without knowing the dream itself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God alone reveals mysteries and holds the ultimate knowledge of all things, as demonstrated in Daniel's ability to interpret the king's dream.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Daniel's faithfulness and reliance on God in a foreign land serve as a model for believers facing trials and challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>The failure of the Chaldeans underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the necessity of divine insight.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer_and_dependence_on_god.htm">The Importance of Prayer and Dependence on God</a></b><br>Daniel's response to seek God in prayer for revelation emphasizes the importance of prayer in seeking divine guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_to_stand_for_truth.htm">Courage to Stand for Truth</a></b><br>Daniel's boldness in approaching the king with God's revelation encourages believers to stand firm in truth, even in intimidating circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_9_Honesty_s_role_in_leadership.htm">How does Daniel 2:9 demonstrate the importance of honesty in leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_9_God_s_control_over_events.htm">What does Daniel 2:9 reveal about God's sovereignty over human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Daniel_2_9_s_accountability_today.htm">How can we apply the lesson of accountability from Daniel 2:9 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Daniel_2_9_and_Proverbs_12_22_link.htm">In what ways does Daniel 2:9 connect to Proverbs 12:22 on truthfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_9_Rely_on_God_for_wisdom.htm">How does Daniel 2:9 encourage reliance on God for wisdom and understanding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_9_and_prophetic_dream_validity.htm">How does Daniel 2:9 challenge the authenticity of prophetic dreams in the Bible?

He refuses to separate interpretation from revelation. Like <a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>, where would-be prophets are tested by accuracy, the king insists on proof before he will listen.<p>- His demand exposes the emptiness of human wisdom (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>). The court magicians claim access to the gods, yet the king&#8217;s requirement shows that true knowledge must come from the one true God (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is only one decree for you</b><p>- &#8220;One decree&#8221; means a single, unchangeable sentence&#8212;death (see <a href="/daniel/2-12.htm">Daniel 2:12</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>). The monarch&#8217;s word is law, echoing the inflexible edicts of <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>.<p>- The statement underscores accountability: either the wise men possess supernatural insight or they perish. It anticipates <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, reminding us that failing the divine test brings judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have conspired to speak before me false and fraudulent words, hoping the situation will change</b><p>- Nebuchadnezzar accuses the advisers of stalling for time, paralleling <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a> where Felix delays for personal advantage.<p>- &#8220;False and fraudulent words&#8221; highlight how worldly counsel often substitutes expediency for truth (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>). God will soon contrast this deceit with Daniel&#8217;s integrity, for &#8220;no lie is of the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-21.htm">1 John 2:21</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;hoping the situation will change&#8221; shows the futility of manipulating circumstances instead of submitting to God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can give me its interpretation</b><p>- The king&#8217;s final challenge sets the stage for God to display His omniscience. Like Pharaoh testing Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41-15.htm">Genesis 41:15-16</a>, Nebuchadnezzar insists on evidence that the interpretation comes from a realm beyond human guessing.<p>- Daniel will soon meet the demand, confirming <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>&#8212;that God alone declares the end from the beginning.<p>- This requirement rebukes any separation between revelation and application; only authentic divine insight carries authority (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s harsh ultimatum in <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9</a> exposes the impotence of human wisdom and underscores the need for divine revelation.

The verse reminds us that truth and interpretation stand or fall together, and only the God who knows secrets can reveal and explain them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">There is but one decree.--</span>He refers to the decree mentioned <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm" title="The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.">Daniel 2:5</a>, that both the dream and the interpretation must be told.

This is the rendering of the Septuagint. Theodotion and Jerome render the first word, which is really the relative, as "therefore," e<span class="accented">rgo</span>, "then," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. The Peshitta has <span class="accented">den</span>, the corresponding Syriac phrase, which has a similar <span class="accented">sense</span> to that assumed here. The rendering of the next clause, both in the Septuagint and in the version of Theodotion, differs considerably from the Massoretic text. The rendering of the Septuagint is as follows: "If ye do not truly tell me the dream, an,l show me the interpretation, ye shall die." The version of Theodotion is shorter, "It, then, ye will not tell me the dream." Theodotion thus omits the clause translated, "there is <span class="accented">but one decree for you</span>;" the only word that may be the remains of it is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>, or simply the participle, The Syriac is, "If ye will not declare the dream to me, one is your plan and your word." The text of the Septuagint in this case indicates that we have here additions from previous verses. The phrase, "and declare to me the interpretation," is evidently supplied from ver. 5, whereas "ye shall die." literally, "ye shall chance to (fall into) death," has a different origin. This phrase has all the appearance of a translation. It would seem applicable on the idea that in the text before the Septuagint translator, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">datheon</span>), "your decree," there stood <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">motheon</span>), "your death," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) being omitted, and possibly the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (be), and <span class="accented">milch</span> being read into some part of <span class="accented">nephal</span>, "to fall," probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tippelun</span>). The omission of this clause, as above mentioned, from Theodotion renders it a little doubtful, as it indicates that in the text used by the Jews of Asia Minor this phrase was awanting. Most commentators take <span class="accented">dath</span> in the sense more common in Eastern than in Western Aramaic, of "pica" rather than "decree" Ewald and Professor Bevan oppose this view, as also Keil, the last with great positiveness. The facts that so many commentators give this meaning, and that certain Rabbinic authorities reterred to but not named by Jephet-ibn-Ali prove it to be no impossible translation. Hitzig, Von Lengerke, Maurer, Michaelis, and Moses Stuart are not quite despicable. The main reason against this view is that in Western Aramaic <span class="accented">dath</span> means "decree," in Eastern Aramaic it means, according to Castell, <span class="accented">scopus</span>, <span class="accented">meta</span>, <span class="accented">finis</span>, <span class="accented">voluntas.</span> The only difficulty is that he gives no reference, and Brockel-mann gives only <span class="accented">lex</span>, which in this case it cannot be, though this is the only reference beside Hoffmann's 'Glossary.' It might be an individual "decree," but a "law" it cannot be. On the received renderings the succession is somewhat violent. "If ye will not tell me the dream, one is your decree," can only be made consecutive by a violent jerk away back to the fifth verse. It seems more natural to take it as meaning, "Ye have agreed together to say one thing to me." The accusation of conspiracy naturally followed from the king's firm conviction that the soothsayers could tell, if they only would, what he required of them. If there began to dawn upon him any idea that their silence was due to inability to answer, it might well move him to redoubled anger that they had been guilty of imposture in claiming such lofty powers and being so highly paid and honoured for their exercise. The king's mind had not yet abandoned the faith of his fathers in magic and divination. For ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me. It' the Septuagint is to be taken as our guide, the word <span class="accented">shheethah</span> is a doubtful addition to the Massoretic text It is, however, in the other later versions. According to the rendering of both the Greek versions, the meaning here is stronger than that which is expressed in the Authorized Version; <span class="accented">hizdaminton</span> really means "to conspire." He will not admit the plea of inability to satisfy his demands - the vague suspicion may be floating before his mind - as, if he were to admit their inability to satisfy what he wished to learn, then, according to his logic, all their claims were false. Hence the accusation of "lying and corrupt words" would still stand, and have all the greater emphasis. Waiving the question of the authenticity of "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," the distinction between the two words "<span class="accented">lying"</span> and "corrupt" seems to be in this: the first refers to the person addressed - to Nebuchadnezzar, - the words are untrue, they are lies - as coming from the soothsayers they are "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," because they are symptomatic of a corrupt disposition, probably traitor, us. Till the time be changed. Theodotion renders here. "till the time be passed." The Septuagint follows a similar reading to that in the Massoretic text. The Peshitta rendering is akin to that of Theodotion. While in all forms of magic and soothsaying, time was an element not to be neglected, it was doubly important in regard to astrology, and an hour or two changed the position of the moon in relation to the constellations. If something required to be clone in consequence of this dream, then most likely it would require to be done in a certain relation of the heavenly bodies to each other. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. The Septuagint rendering is paraphrastic, "Now then, if ye tell me the thing which I saw in the night, I shall know that ye can also show the interpretation." While we have called it a paraphrase as regards the Massoretic text, the rendering in the Septuagint may represent the Egyptian recension of the text of Daniel. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or "thing" suggests translation, and assumes <span class="accented">millah</span> or <span class="accented">mill'tha</span>, which has the same double suggestion of "word spoken" and "thing spoken about." If the Septuagint text were assumed here, we should have confirmation of our view that Nebuchadnezzar remembered his vision, but was determined to experiment on the soothsayers of his court. This view is certainly implied in the following clause. The first word of this clause is peculiar grammatically: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">in'd'a</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">iyda</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('idda). This form of compensating for a dropped consonant by inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">nun</span>) instead of doubling occurs elsewhere in Biblical Aramaic (see ver. 30). This is rare in Syriac, and in the Targums found only in those later, especially those of the Megilloth, which have affinities with the form of Aramaic seen in the Babylonian Talmud. This peculiarity is common in the Maudaitic dialect. It is thus a distinctively Eastern form of Aramaic that is indicated here. When we pass beyond the grammatical elements, we find that Nebuchadnezzar would take correct information as to what he had dreamed a guarantee of the correctness of the interpretation of the dream which the soothsayers might afterwards give him. His attitude was purely and truly scientific, as it is stated. In his own mind he was warped and confused by his overmastering belief in omens and auguries, in gods and demons, in magicians and astrologers. With this faith in his heart, his only explanation of the silence of these soothsayers was treason. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2006.htm">Strong's 2006: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, there, less, whether, but, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3809.htm">Strong's 3809: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#7695;&#183;&#8216;un&#183;na&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural &#124;
