Historically, these are the Hellenistic kingdoms, specifically the Seleucid Empire, which is relevant to the context of <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>. The "latter part" suggests a time when these kingdoms are nearing their decline, setting the stage for significant changes and events.<p><b>when the rebellion has reached its full measure</b><br>The "rebellion" here can be interpreted as a culmination of transgressions and moral decay within these kingdoms. This phrase suggests a period of widespread apostasy and sin, which aligns with the biblical theme of God allowing certain events to unfold as a result of human rebellion. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where the iniquity of the Amorites had to reach its full measure before judgment.<p><b>an insolent king</b><br>This king is often identified as Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a ruler of the Seleucid Empire known for his arrogance and blasphemous actions against the Jewish people and their faith. His character and actions are seen as a foreshadowing of the Antichrist, a future figure in Christian eschatology who will oppose God and His people.<p><b>skilled in intrigue</b><br>Antiochus IV was known for his cunning and deceitful political maneuvers. This phrase highlights his ability to manipulate and deceive, traits that are often associated with figures who oppose God's purposes. The skill in intrigue suggests a level of intelligence and craftiness that allows him to gain power and influence through deceptive means.<p><b>will come to the throne</b><br>This indicates the rise to power of this king, which is historically accurate as Antiochus IV seized the throne through a series of political and military strategies. His ascent to power was marked by intrigue and betrayal, fitting the description provided in the prophecy. This rise is seen as part of God's sovereign plan, allowing such a ruler to come to power as a means of fulfilling divine prophecy and testing His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_latter_part_of_their_reign.htm">The Latter Part of Their Reign</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the end times of a particular kingdom or series of kingdoms, often interpreted as the Greek Empire's division after Alexander the Great's death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebels.htm">Rebels</a></b><br>These are individuals or groups who have turned away from God's ways, becoming completely wicked.

Antiochus IV serves as both historical proof of fulfilled prophecy and a prophetic preview of the final antichrist. Sin will ripen, deceit will flourish, thrones will shift, yet the Lord&#8217;s timeline remains unshakable. With Scripture in hand, we are equipped to recognize the signs, resist deception, and await the unchallenged reign of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Transgressors</span> . . .--When transgressors have filled up the measure of their guilt so as to exceed the limits of God's mercy, then this event shall take place. The transgressors are the apostate Jews. Here, as in the other visions, the particulars respecting the most prominent objects of the vision are given more fully in the interpretation than in the early part of the chapter. The king is represented as being "of a fierce countenance," he is shameless, he has no reluctance in pursuing the cruelties which he has designed. He "understands dark sayings," or uses falsehood and dissimulation to carry out his purposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</span> The versions here are, on the whole, in agreement with the Massoretic. The Greek versions read, "their sins," as if it were the iniquities of the successors of Alexander that had become full, and thus afforded the occasion of the appearance of Epiphanes. The Peshitta and Jerome have "iniquities" generally, without reference to the kings, but with probable reference to the Jewish people. The probability is decidedly in favour of the Massoretic reading; it was an easy suggestion that the iniquities to be punished were those of the heathen kings. The whole analogy of Scripture leads us to look at the iniquity of the people of God being the cause of evil befalling them. Certainly immediately before the persecution inflicted on the <span class="accented">Jews</span> by Antiochus, the progress of the unbelieving Hellenizing party had been very great, as we see by 1 Macc. 1:13-16. It was "like people, like priest;" the people devoted themselves to Grecian games with all their heathen associations, and strove to hide their Hebrew origin and the covenant of their faith, and high priests were ready to abet their practices. <span class="accented">A king of fierce countenance</span>; "<span class="accented">strong</span> of countenance." This refers to courage and success in war. Thus Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a>), when he wishes to challenge Joash King of Israel, desires to "look in his face." Epiphanes' countenance was one that could successfully stand a hostile meeting. The Greek versions render <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;</span> ('<span class="accented">az</span>) by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "reckless." <span class="accented">Understanding dark sentences.</span> There may be some reference to incantations and superstitious observances; it may mean that he was well acquainted with omens, and how to benefit by them. Regardlessness in the matter of religion was a prominent characteristic of Antiochus; but it is quite a possible thing that, like most irreligious men, he was superstitious. He certainly was very keen-sighted in observing the political signs of the times, and very adroit at availing himself of what made for his own advantage. This last is the interpretation of Ewald. Zockler and Hitzig think it means that the king here pictured "will be cunning to hide his own designs from friend and foe." Yet more common is the view of Keil, Behrmann, Stuart, and Bevan, that it refers generally to his mastery in the use of artifice. The main difficulty in regard to this view is that usage, does not support assigning such a meaning to <span class="accented">heedoth.</span> On the other hand, when we bear in mind that here we have the language of symbol and prophecy, so tricks of strategy and chicane of policy may all be symbolized by "dark sayings," without necessary reference to <span class="accented">sentences</span> such as those with which the Queen of Sheba tested the wisdom of Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the latter part</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
