This action reflects his trust in God and his role as a mediator between God and the king. Daniel's willingness to enter the king's presence shows his confidence in God's ability to reveal mysteries, a theme consistent with his character throughout the book.<p><b>and asked the king to give him some time</b><br>Daniel's request for time indicates his reliance on divine intervention rather than human wisdom. In the context of Babylonian culture, where magicians and wise men were expected to provide immediate answers, Daniel's request is bold. It underscores the difference between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world. This moment parallels other biblical instances where God's people seek divine guidance, such as Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>so that he could give him the interpretation</b><br>Daniel's assurance that he could provide the interpretation highlights his faith in God's revelation. This confidence is rooted in his understanding of God's sovereignty and his previous experiences of God's faithfulness. The interpretation of dreams is a recurring theme in the Bible, often used to convey God's plans and purposes, as seen in the stories of Joseph and later in the New Testament with visions given to the apostles. Daniel's role as an interpreter foreshadows Christ, who reveals the mysteries of God's kingdom to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man of noble lineage, taken into Babylonian captivity.

He approaches an enraged monarch, requests time to seek God, and believes the Lord will unveil the mystery. The verse models how believers today can face impossible demands: draw near, ask boldly, wait prayerfully, and anticipate God&#8217;s clear answer&#8212;knowing the One who &#8220;reveals mysteries&#8221; still speaks through His unerring Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Daniel went in.--</span>Two characteristics of the prophet strike us, which distinguish the one who trusts in God's help from those who relied entirely upon their secular wisdom. (1) The courage of Daniel, which led him to venture into the king's presence upon a humane errand. (2) His humility, in asking the king to give him time. The wise men regarded the whole matter as an impossibility, and treated it as such, not even asking for any extension of time. But the faith of Daniel inspired him with this courageous humility, and was amply rewarded.<p>We are not told in so many words that this extension of time was granted, or that Daniel undertook to show more than the interpretation of the dream. A true account of what happened can only be gathered by reading <a href="/daniel/2-18.htm" title="That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.">Daniel 2:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-28.htm" title="But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these;">Daniel 2:28</a> by the side of this verse. It should be remembered that many narratives of scripture are related in a very condensed form, fuller details being added afterwards. (See <a href="/daniel/2-24.htm" title="Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.">Daniel 2:24</a>, Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation</span>. The version of Theodotion omits all mention of Daniel's going into the palace, "And Daniel petitioned the king that he should give him time, and he would tell his interpretation to the king." The rendering of the Peshitta agrees with this, "And Daniel petitioned the king for time, and he would show the interpretation to the king." The version of the Septuagint is longer, "And Daniel went in quickly to the king, and petitioned that time should be given him from the king, and he would show all things to the king." Jerome gives a rendering of the Massoretic text in Latin condensation. The question of reading here is of some importance in the light of the apparent contradiction implied in the twenty-fifth verse. There Arioch declares that he "had found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation" <span class="accented">-</span> as if Nebuchadnezzar had never seen him before, whereas, if the Massoretic recension is correct, Nebuchadnezzar had seen Daniel but a little while before. According to the reading of Theodotion and the Peshitta, Daniel pet:tinned the king for time, but that petition does not imply necessarily that he was admitted into the king's presence; the petition would pass through court officials, and reach the king in due course. We may note the ease with which he granted this request, and look upon it as confirmatory of our notion that the king, now that his rage had gone down, repented of his harsh decree, and was hoping against hope that the catastrophe would be averted. The only other explanation that would save the authenticity of both passages is that Daniel's entrance into the palace and his petition to the king happened without Arioch being aware. The most natural explanation of Arioch's conduct in post-poning the execution of the royal decree is that the postponement was during the interval the petition for time was being presented, but still not decided on. This seems not unlikely. Of course, it is always open to us to declare the verses from this to the twenty-fourth inclusive an interpolation; Daniel has suffered so much from this, that an additional case has no <span class="accented">prima facie</span> probability against it. Moreover, the prayer or hymn has strong resemblance to the prayer of Azarias, which is acknowledged to be an interpolation. Still, one ought to be slow to cut a knot in this way, unless there is some clear ground of suspicion. It may be observed also that the Massoretic text does not necessarily assert entrance into the palace or into the king's presence. Certainly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>: ('<span class="accented">alal</span>) means "entered," and in the connection this would suggest the palace as the place entered, but it may have been the house of Arioch, though this is not likely. We have no means of knowing whether any others of those implicated in the sentence of the king petitioned also for time. Not impossibly they did. The king, who was so suspicious that the wise men wished to delay till the auspicious time was passed, is willing to grant time when it is asked. This is explicable on the idea that Nebuchadnezzar was anxious to be delivered from the horrible slaughter which his decree involved. Another thing to be observed is that in the Massoretic text, Theodotion, and the Peshitta, there is no word of the dream being told. Of course, this interpretation implied a knowledge of the dream also, but it would appear to be another evidence that the king was relenting, when a petition that omitted the crucial point of the question between him and the wise men should be granted without difficulty. We are not told the amount of time requested, the word used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">zeman</span>), is, "a fixed time," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, "to determine." It occurs again frequently in Daniel, as in ver. 21. It is generally of a fixed point of time, but sometimes, as <a href="/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, their lives were prolonged for a season (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). There being only one instance among the other passages where this word occurs, in which it means a space of time, we are inclined to think that here Daniel petitioned that a time be appointed him when he too should have an audience of the king in regard to the matter of the dream, as the other wise men had. There certainly is implied a space of time in this request. The space must have involved at least twenty-four hours, as the matter is revealed to Daniel in "a night vision." It is unlikely it would be much longer, for fear the planetary collocation would change - certainly not more than a week. Tertullian ('Adv. Psychicos,' 7) says, "Daniel <span class="accented">Deo fidens</span>... spatium tridui <span class="accented">poslulat."</span> We learn from what follows that Daniel acted tamely from his general faith in God, and was confident that God would not suffer his saints to be destroyed causelessly, it is noted by Calvin that Daniel (lees not tell the king the reasons of his confidence. <span class="accented">A falsarius</span> would have taken the opportunity of making Daniel declare his confidence in the God of heaven from the very first. The real Daniel acts as any wise saint would do, confident that God would do justly, hopeful that he would reveal to him the secret, yet too careful of the honour of Jehovah to put it in pledge; he knew God could and would defend his own honour, and his plan might not involve the saving of their lives. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1443;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
