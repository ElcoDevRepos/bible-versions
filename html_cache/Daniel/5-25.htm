The context is a royal banquet in Babylon, where sacred vessels from the Jerusalem temple were profaned. This event occurs during the reign of Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon, highlighting the impending fall of the Babylonian Empire. The writing is a divine message, emphasizing God's sovereignty and judgment.<p><b>MENE, MENE:</b><br>The repetition of "MENE" underscores the certainty and urgency of the message. "MENE" means "numbered," indicating that God has numbered the days of Belshazzar's kingdom and brought it to an end. This reflects the biblical theme of divine judgment and the transient nature of earthly kingdoms. The repetition also serves as a literary device to emphasize the finality of God's decree.<p><b>TEKEL:</b><br>"TEKEL" means "weighed." This signifies that Belshazzar has been weighed on God's scales and found wanting. It echoes the biblical principle that God examines the hearts and actions of individuals and nations. The imagery of weighing suggests a moral and spiritual evaluation, aligning with other scriptures that speak of God's righteous judgment.<p><b>PARSIN:</b><br>"PARSIN" is the plural form of "PERES," meaning "divided." It indicates that the kingdom will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians. This prophecy is fulfilled when Babylon falls to the Medo-Persian Empire. The division of the kingdom symbolizes the end of Babylon's dominance and the rise of a new power, illustrating the shifting dynamics of world empires under God's control. The term also plays on the word "Persians," hinting at the conquerors' identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the time of this event.

Hence it has been conjectured that the second <span class= "ital">Mene</span> was originally <span class= "ital">Madai,</span> or Media. This, though it appears plausible, has no external support. The word <span class= "ital">Mene,</span> "numbered," is repeated twice for the sake of emphasis. The days of Babylon are numbered; it is God Himself who has numbered them. "Mene" is used in the double sense of "numbering" and "bringing to an end." Similarly, "Tekel" implies both the act of "weighing" and the fact of "being light." The "<span class= "ital">u"</span> in <span class= "ital">Upharsin</span> is the conjunction "and," while <span class= "ital">pharsin,</span> or, rather, <span class= "ital">parsin,</span> is the plural of <span class= "ital">peres,</span> a noun which implies "divisions" and also Persians. It appears from <a href="/daniel/5-28.htm" title="PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.">Daniel 5:28</a> that the divided empire of Babylon and the Medo-Persian empire are signified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians</span>. The Septuagint has two versions of this passage, one m the text, the other in the portion at the beginning, which we think is really composed of marginal readings. In the text the Aramaic is not given at all. As we have already seen, the verse which corresponds to ver. 25 here is really the latter part of ver. 17 of the Septuagint, "This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it is reckoned; it has been carried away." In the verses which are appended to the beginning of the chapter, we have the Aramaic words, but given in a different order, and without the repetition of the first word: "MANE, PHARES, THEKEL. MANE, It has been numbered; PHARES, It is carried away; TnEKEL, It has been set up." Here not only is the order different, but the meaning assigned to <span class="accented">phares</span> is singular. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> means in Syriac, "spread out." It would seem that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> meant "stretched out" as well as "carried away." It is still more difficult to understand how <span class="accented">thekel </span>can mean "set up," unless the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;</span>, "on the balance," are understood. The Septuagint of the best version is briefer than the Massoretic, though less so than it is in some of the other passages, "Numbered is the time of thy kingdom; ceases thy kingdom; cut short and ended has been thy kingdom; to the Modes and the Persians has it been given." The word interpreted is not repeated as in the Massoretic text, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, which in some of the conjugations means "destroyed," whereas in ver. 17 it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "it is reckoned," a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;</span> which makes it mean "weigh." The Septuagint rendering of the first clause is an evident attempt at explaining the numbering implied. The Massoretic reading involves a pun in both the last words; there is a play between <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">teqel</span>), "to weigh," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qelal</span>), "to be light," although the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d7;</span> rather conceals this. In the last the play is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e1;</span>, "to divide," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d3;&#x5e1;</span>, "a Persian." Theodotion avoids the repetition of the first word, otherwise he is in somewhat close agreement with the Massoretic text, "MANE, God hath measured thy kingdom; THEKEL, It is set on the balance, and found wanting; PHARES, Thy kingdom is cut asunder, and given to the Medes and the Persians." The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The actual meaning of the words, taking them as they appear in the Massoretictext, as Aramaic words, is, to give English equivalents, "a pound, a pound, an ounce, and quarters;" hence the impossibility of interpreting the words. We find all these words, <span class="accented">mena</span>, <span class="accented">teqel</span> (shekel), <span class="accented">pares</span>, in the Ninevite inscriptions. As the words are interpreted, we cannot fail to be impressed with the peremptory style of the inscription, as Hitzig has it. Zockler refers to the sculpturesque style (<span class="accented">lapidarstil</span>). This brevity rendered it difficult for the soothsayers to put any meaning into the words at all. In all the versions the fact that the kingdom is to be given to the Medes and Persians <span class="cmt_word">is</span> emphasized, but, moreover, the play on words in the last clause implies the Persians as the prominent assailants of the Babylonian power, but really that the two powers were united. It seems extraordinary that any one, in the face of this, should maintain that the author of Daniel separated the two powers, and thought the Median power succeeded the Babylonian, and then that the Persian succeeded the Median. We know now that Herodotus's representation of the history of Media and Persia is utterly false and misleading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the inscription</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3792.htm">Strong's 3792: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something written, a writing, record, book</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was written:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7560.htm">Strong's 7560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inscribe, sign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">MENE,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4484.htm">Strong's 4484: </a> </span><span class="str2">Maneh, mina (a measure of weight)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">MENE,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4484.htm">Strong's 4484: </a> </span><span class="str2">Maneh, mina (a measure of weight)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">TEKEL,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;q&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8625.htm">Strong's 8625: </a> </span><span class="str2">To balance</span><br /><br /><span class="word">PARSIN.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;ar&#183;s&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6537.htm">Strong's 6537: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break in two</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/5-25.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 5:25 This is the writing that was inscribed: (Dan.
