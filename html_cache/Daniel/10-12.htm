It indicates the overwhelming nature of such encounters and the need for comfort. Daniel, a prophet in exile, is being reassured by a heavenly messenger, emphasizing God's care and the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>he said,</b><br>The speaker is an angelic being, likely Gabriel, who previously appeared to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16, 9</a>:21). Angels often serve as messengers of God, conveying His will and providing insight into divine plans.<p><b>for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God,</b><br>Daniel's intention to understand and his humility are key themes. His actions reflect a deep commitment to seeking God's will and understanding His plans. This mirrors the biblical principle that God honors those who earnestly seek Him (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). Daniel's humility is a model for believers, showing the importance of approaching God with a contrite heart.<p><b>your words were heard,</b><br>This assurance highlights the power of prayer and God's attentiveness to the prayers of the faithful. It echoes other biblical passages where God hears and responds to the cries of His people (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>). Daniel's prayers are effective because they align with God's will and are offered in humility.<p><b>and I have come in response to them.</b><br>The angel's arrival is a direct result of Daniel's prayers, demonstrating the connection between prayer and divine action. This reflects the biblical teaching that God sends help and guidance in response to the prayers of His people (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).

This is the more remarkable as <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> stands for "Jehovah" usually in the Greek versions - a title rarely occurring in Daniel in, and only in, the prayer of the preceding chapter. This addition does not occur in the Peshitta or Vulgate. <span class="accented">He said unto me</span>, <span class="accented">Fear not</span>, <span class="accented">Daniel.</span> Still the signs of terror were manifest in Daniel, and the angel spoke encouragingly to him. <span class="accented">For from the first day</span>, etc. When Daniel had begun his petition to God and his effort to understand God's purpose concerning his people, then God had commissioned Gabriel. The whole process of humiliation, fasting, and prayer was allowed to go on to its completion before Gabriel came, in order to deepen in Daniel the desire for the hoped-for revelation, and thus enhance the joy of it when it came, and, perchance, also to justify to higher intelligences the giving of this special communication (comp. <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>) as to the answer being ready even while the petition was being put up. <span class="accented">And I am come for thy words.</span> Professor Fuller sees in this an additional tenderness. Zockler sees in it that in the Divine counsel Gabriel was commissioned, but was hindered for reasons assigned in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be afraid,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1840.htm">Strong's 1840: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
