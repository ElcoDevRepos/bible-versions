Historically, this is often associated with Seleucus IV Philopator, a ruler of the Seleucid Empire. The "fortresses" symbolize the strongholds or fortified cities within his territory, indicating a retreat or a strategic withdrawal. This action suggests a shift in focus from expansion to consolidation, possibly due to external pressures or internal challenges. The decision to turn back can be seen as a moment of vulnerability, highlighting the transient nature of earthly power and the limitations of human ambition.<p><b>but he will stumble and fall</b><br>The imagery of stumbling and falling conveys a sudden and unexpected downfall. In the historical context, Seleucus IV's reign ended abruptly due to his assassination, orchestrated by his own officials. This serves as a reminder of the precariousness of political power and the potential for betrayal from within. Biblically, the concept of stumbling is often used to describe moral or spiritual failure, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>, which speaks of the righteous falling but rising again. This phrase underscores the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs, where God ultimately determines the rise and fall of leaders.<p><b>and be no more</b><br>This final phrase signifies the complete end of the king's reign and life. It emphasizes the finality of his demise, leaving no legacy or continuation of his rule. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, where those who oppose God's purposes are ultimately brought to nothing. The phrase echoes the transient nature of human life and power, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears briefly and then vanishes. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where earthly powers are temporary, but God's reign is eternal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This passage is part of a prophecy concerning the "king of the North," a ruler who engages in various military campaigns and political maneuvers.

After his defeat, Antiochus was not only compelled to submit to the loss of much of his empire, but was adjudged to pay all the expenses of the war, estimated at eighteen thousand Euboeic talents. Justin relates thus the death of Antiochus: "Meanwhile in Syria King Antiochus, being loaded with heavy tribute after his defeat by the Romans, whether urged by want of money or impelled by avarice, flattering himself that, under the plea of necessity, he might with fair excuse commit sacrilege, assaulted with an armed force by night the temple of Jove (Bel) in Elymais But the attempt having been discovered, there was a concourse of the inhabitants, and he was slain with all his forces." The resemblance here between the fate of Antiochus the Great and that of his son Epiphanes is so striking as to throw suspicion on one or other of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After this, he will turn back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his face</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Conjunctive imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the fortresses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;z&#183;z&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4581.htm">Strong's 4581: </a> </span><span class="str2">A place or means of safety, protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his own land,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but he will stumble</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#7733;&#183;&#353;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3782.htm">Strong's 3782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To totter, waver, to falter, stumble, faint, fall</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fall</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;p&#772;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and be no more.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/11-19.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward (Dan.
