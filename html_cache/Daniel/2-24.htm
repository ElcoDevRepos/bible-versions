Arioch was the captain of the king's guard, tasked with executing the wise men. Daniel's willingness to confront Arioch shows his confidence in God's revelation. This act of faith is reminiscent of other biblical figures who approached authority with boldness, such as Esther before King Xerxes.<p><b>whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon</b><br>The wise men of Babylon included magicians, enchanters, and astrologers who were unable to interpret King Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The king's decree to destroy them highlights the absolute power of Babylonian rulers and the precarious position of those serving in the royal court. This context underscores the tension and urgency of the situation Daniel faced.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Do not execute the wise men of Babylon!</b><br>Daniel's plea for the lives of the wise men reflects his compassion and desire for mercy. It also illustrates the biblical principle of intercession, where a righteous individual stands in the gap for others, similar to Moses interceding for Israel. Daniel's actions foreshadow Christ's intercession for humanity.<p><b>Bring me before the king,</b><br>Daniel's request to be brought before the king shows his readiness to act on the revelation he received from God. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for Daniel to demonstrate the power and wisdom of the God of Israel. It parallels Joseph's rise to prominence in Egypt after interpreting Pharaoh's dreams.<p><b>and I will give him the interpretation.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's confidence in providing the interpretation is rooted in his faith in God's revelation. This assurance is a testament to the divine wisdom granted to him, distinguishing him from the other wise men. The interpretation of dreams is a recurring theme in Scripture, often used to reveal God's plans, as seen in the stories of Joseph and the prophetic visions in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams through God's revelation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arioch.htm">Arioch</a></b><br>The captain of the king's guard, tasked with executing the wise men of Babylon as per King Nebuchadnezzar's decree.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to his order to execute them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_babylon.htm">Wise Men of Babylon</a></b><br>A group of magicians, enchanters, and astrologers who were unable to interpret the king's dream, thus facing execution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and his friends were held captive, known for its wealth, power, and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Daniel's approach to Arioch demonstrates the courage that comes from faith in God's provision and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_for_others.htm">Intercession for Others</a></b><br>Daniel's plea to spare the wise men shows the importance of interceding for others, even those who may not share our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The situation underscores God's control over earthly kingdoms and His ability to reveal hidden truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_from_god.htm">Wisdom from God</a></b><br>True wisdom and understanding come from God, not human intellect or power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_witness.htm">Boldness in Witness</a></b><br>Like Daniel, believers are called to be bold in their witness, trusting God to provide the words and wisdom needed.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_24_God_s_sovereignty_in_mysteries.htm">How does Daniel 2:24 demonstrate God's sovereignty in revealing mysteries to believers?

The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, an emendation due to the fact that the king had demanded from the wise men, not merely the interpretation, which, given the dream, they were willing enough to give, but the dream itself; only the more natural emendation would have been to have interpolated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, (<span class="accented">hel'ma</span>), "dream," be fore "interpretation." Both the Septuagint and Theodotion omit the word representing the second "went." It is to be observed that "went in" and "went" are different words in the original, as in the Peshitta Version. The verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">alal</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>) have different ideas connected with them. The first means "to enter," of a place with a preposition; the latter has the notion of simple going. If we can imagine the body-guard of the king quartered in some part of the huge palace, then Daniel "went in" first to the quarters of the guard, and then, having got a mission, "went" up to Arioch, who was probably endeavouring to occupy as much time as possible to delay the horrible exe cution, or perhaps escape the necessity altogether. It would seem as if Arioch had heard nothing of the petition which Daniel had presented to the king, and only knew that his delay had not been found fault with. It might seem by the introductory word "therefore" (<span class="accented">kol-qebe-denah</span>) that the hymn has been an interpolation. It is quite true that it would most naturally immediately follow ver. 19. Yet we must bear in mind that the consecution of one part to another, which we have in our Western languages, is not so carefully observed in Eastern tongues. It may be doubted, more over, whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kol-qebel-denah</span>) has so much a logical , as a local or temporal significance. "'Thereupon" would, perhaps, more correctly render this connective here. After he had finished offering up his praise and thanks to God, Daniel went to Arioch. As we have already said, it would seem that Arioch had a reluctance to set about the fulfilment of this horrible order, not that mere slaughter was a thing specially repugnant to him - he had taken part in too many campaigns for that to impress him much; but this was a massacre of the priests. All the reverence of his nature that during his lifetime had associated itself with those who had solemnly sacrificed before each campaign, and taken the auguries, protested against this sudden and wholesale massacre. He has determined to fritter away time, in order to give his master opportunity to bethink himself The mere political ill will that would be roused by such an attempt was formidable. We know that the Babylonian monarch Nabunahid really rather fell before the intrigines of the priests and augurs than before the arms of Cyrus. To him, thus waiting and procrastinating, comes Daniel. Although there is nothing said of it in the narrative, Daniel may have given him to understand that he hoped to be able to satisfy the demands of the king. The power Daniel had of gaining the favour and confidence of those with whom he came in contacts led to his being buoyed up by a certain hope in his procrastination, which would be strengthened by the fact that the fiery young king made no inquiry whether his order was being fulfilled. Still, it must have been with joy he saw Daniel appearing, and heard him say, "Destroy not the wise men of Babylon," especially when followed by the request to be brought into the presence of the king; thus he knew that Daniel could answer the king's question and tell him his dream, as well as the promised interpretation. If we take the Septuagint rendering as representing the original text, Daniel promised to tell the king "everything." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1459;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(qo&#183;&#7687;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6903.htm">Strong's 6903: </a> </span><span class="str2">In front of, before, because of, because that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1841.htm">Strong's 1841: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', an Israelite leader in Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5954.htm">Strong's 5954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To enter, to introduce</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5922.htm">Strong's 5922: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Arioch,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_746.htm">Strong's 746: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arioch -- king of Ellasar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(man&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4483.htm">Strong's 4483: </a> </span><span class="str2">To count, appoint</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to destroy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
