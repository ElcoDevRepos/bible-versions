Daniel is a prophet who receives divine revelations, and his role as a seer is crucial in understanding the unfolding of God's plan. The act of watching suggests vigilance and the importance of being spiritually alert, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where believers are urged to "keep watch" for the coming of the Lord.<p><b>this horn</b><br>The "horn" is a symbol of power and authority, often used in biblical prophecy to represent kings or kingdoms. In the context of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, the horn is part of the fourth beast, which is generally interpreted as a representation of a future oppressive regime or ruler. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, where horns symbolize the power of the beast. The horn's emergence and actions are significant in the eschatological timeline, pointing to a period of intense persecution.<p><b>was waging war against the saints</b><br>The phrase "waging war" indicates active hostility and aggression. The "saints" refer to the holy people of God, often understood as those who are faithful to God's covenant. This conflict is not merely physical but also spiritual, reflecting the ongoing battle between good and evil. Historically, the persecution of God's people has been a recurring theme, seen in the oppression of the Israelites, the early Christian martyrs, and anticipated in future tribulations. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of the spiritual warfare against the forces of evil.<p><b>and prevailing against them</b><br>The notion of prevailing suggests a temporary victory of evil over the saints. This can be troubling, but it is important to understand it within the broader biblical narrative of ultimate redemption and victory through Christ. The temporary success of the horn is a test of faith and endurance for the saints, reminiscent of the trials faced by Job or the early church under Roman persecution. However, the ultimate triumph belongs to God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ returns to defeat the forces of evil. This phrase serves as a reminder of the need for perseverance and faith in God's ultimate justice and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.
