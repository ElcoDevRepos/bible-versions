"Those days" refers to a specific period during the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, after the Jewish exiles had begun returning to Jerusalem. This was a time of significant transition and uncertainty for the Jewish people, as they were re-establishing their community and religious practices in their homeland. The phrase indicates a period of reflection and spiritual significance.<p><b>I, Daniel</b><br>Daniel, the author and central figure of the book, is a Jewish exile who rose to prominence in the Babylonian and Persian empires. Known for his wisdom and prophetic visions, Daniel's experiences and writings have been a source of encouragement and instruction for believers. His personal involvement in the narrative underscores the authenticity and firsthand nature of the account.<p><b>was mourning</b><br>Mourning in the biblical context often involved fasting, prayer, and wearing sackcloth and ashes. It was a time of deep emotional and spiritual reflection. Daniel's mourning could be related to the challenges faced by the returning exiles, the delay in the rebuilding of the temple, or a response to a vision or revelation he received. Mourning was a common practice among the Israelites during times of distress or repentance.<p><b>for three full weeks</b><br>The duration of Daniel's mourning, three full weeks, signifies a period of complete dedication to seeking God. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. This extended period of mourning suggests the seriousness of Daniel's concerns and his commitment to interceding for his people. It also sets the stage for the subsequent vision and revelation he receives, highlighting the importance of perseverance in prayer and fasting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his unwavering faith and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.

The versions are close to the Massoretic, only the Septuagint, and, following it, the Vetus, as quoted by Tertullian, omit "days," in the literal rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "weeks of days". <span class="accented">Mourning.</span> Zockler and Fuller think this mourning due to the difficulties the released captives had in carrying out their desire of rebuilding the temple. It may have been that he was grieved that so few of the people were willing to avail themselves of the privilege. We are here assuming that the chronology of this passage reckons from the overthrow of Nabunahid, that is, from Cyrus's accession to the throne of Babylon; but, as we have seen, this "third year" may be reckoned from his assumption of the title King of Persia, <span class="accented">San Parsua</span>, in which case it may be the same year with that vision narrated in the previous chapter. <span class="accented">Three full weeks</span>; literally, <span class="accented">three weeks of days</span> - to mark off the duration of Daniel's fast from the weeks of years referred to in the ninth chapter. Keil objects to this interpretation, but assigns no reason. At the same time, it is to be observed that "year of days" means a full year, but a week is such a short period that the necessity of saying that it was complete by defining it a "week of days" is not so obvious, and is unexampled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
