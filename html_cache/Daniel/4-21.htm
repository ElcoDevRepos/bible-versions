In biblical literature, trees often represent kingdoms or rulers (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). The beauty of the foliage reflects the king's power and the prosperity of his empire, which was admired by many.<p><b>and whose fruit was abundant</b><br>The abundant fruit signifies the wealth and resources of Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar's rule. This abundance provided for the needs of the people, illustrating the king's ability to sustain and nourish his subjects. The imagery of fruitfulness is often used in Scripture to denote blessing and prosperity (<a href="/genesis/41-47.htm">Genesis 41:47-49</a>).<p><b>providing food for all</b><br>This phrase highlights the extensive reach and influence of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, which provided for a diverse population. It suggests a time of peace and stability, where the king's governance ensured the well-being of all under his rule. This can be seen as a reflection of God's provision, as He is often depicted as the ultimate provider (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27-28</a>).<p><b>under which the beasts of the field lived</b><br>The beasts of the field represent the various nations and peoples that found shelter and protection under Babylon's dominion. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where animals symbolize different groups or nations (<a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>). It underscores the idea of Babylon as a powerful empire that offered security to those within its sphere.<p><b>and in whose branches the birds of the air nested&#8212;</b><br>The birds nesting in the branches further emphasize the reach and influence of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. Birds often symbolize spiritual beings or nations in biblical texts (<a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>). This imagery suggests that many sought refuge and found a place within the empire, indicating its vastness and the king's role as a unifying figure. The tree can also be seen as a type of Christ, who provides shelter and rest for all who come to Him (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had a dream about a great tree, which Daniel interprets.

For Nebuchadnezzar, that beauty mirrors the dazzling splendor of Babylon itself (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>). Scripture often links lush leaves with healthy, thriving life&#8212;think of the righteous &#8220;tree planted by streams of water&#8230; whose leaf does not wither&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>) or the cedar of Lebanon &#8220;with beautiful branches&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-6</a>). In each case, impressive outward appearance signals God-granted stature. Yet beauty alone can fade if pride enters (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), foreshadowing the king&#8217;s coming humbling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whose fruit was abundant</b><p>Abundant fruit speaks to productivity, prosperity, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/41-47.htm">Genesis 41:47</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>). Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s empire overflowed with resources, culture, and innovation&#8212;evidence that &#8220;the Most High rules the kingdom of men&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). Like Joseph&#8217;s fruitful branches that &#8220;run over the wall&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>), Babylon&#8217;s bounty reached far beyond its borders. Still, fruitfulness is a stewardship; when leaders forget the Giver, abundance can be withdrawn (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14, 19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Providing food for all</b><p>The phrase widens the lens: this tree nourished &#8220;all,&#8221; highlighting how one ruler&#8217;s policies affected countless lives. Solomon&#8217;s era offers a parallel&#8212;Judah and Israel &#8220;ate, drank, and rejoiced&#8221; under his administration (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>). God intends governing authorities to be His servants for good (<a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a>). When they fulfill that role, even unbelieving nations taste common grace (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>). But when self-exaltation displaces servant leadership, the supply chain falters (<a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Under which the beasts of the field lived</b><p>The image shifts from provision to protection. &#8220;Beasts&#8221; symbolize subject peoples and nations resting under imperial security, as in Ezekiel&#8217;s portrait of Assyria&#8217;s cedar: &#8220;All the great nations lived in its shade&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>). Nebuchadnezzar had conquered wide territories (<a href="/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a>), and those regions relied on Babylon&#8217;s civil order. God grants governments the &#8220;branch&#8221; of authority so that society can dwell in relative safety (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6-7</a>). Yet beasts scatter quickly when the tree falls (<a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in whose branches the birds of the air nested</b><p>Birds nesting high picture smaller kingdoms and dignitaries finding refuge in the empire&#8217;s structure&#8212;just as Jesus later applied the same metaphor to the expansive growth of God&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>). From Tyre&#8217;s merchants (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>) to Judah&#8217;s exiles (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>), many perched in Babylon&#8217;s branches. The scene underscores how one man&#8217;s pride or humility impacts multitudes perched on his decisions (<a href="/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-21.htm">Daniel 4:21</a> portrays a majestic, fruit-laden tree that is beautiful to behold, generous in supply, sheltering in scope, and welcoming in reach. The Spirit shows Nebuchadnezzar&#8212;and every leader&#8212;that such splendor is a direct loan from the Sovereign God. Beauty, abundance, provision, protection, and influence all exist to display His glory and bless His creation. When pride eclipses gratitude, the axe is already at the root. But when rulers acknowledge &#8220;the King of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>), their kingdoms can continue to be life-giving trees in God&#8217;s orchard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">whose foliage</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
