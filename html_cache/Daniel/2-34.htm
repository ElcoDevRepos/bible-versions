It emphasizes the immediacy and vividness of the dream, suggesting divine revelation. The act of watching implies a passive role, where the king is a recipient of a message from God, highlighting the sovereignty of God in revealing future events.<p><b>a stone was cut out, but not by human hands</b><br>The stone represents a divine intervention, as it is "cut out" without human involvement. This suggests a supernatural origin, often interpreted as the kingdom of God or the coming of the Messiah. The imagery of a stone is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing strength and permanence. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), linking this vision to the coming of Christ and His eternal kingdom.<p><b>It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay</b><br>The statue in Nebuchadnezzar's dream symbolizes successive world empires, with the feet of iron and clay representing a divided and weakened kingdom. The striking of the feet indicates the vulnerability of human kingdoms and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom. The mixture of iron and clay suggests a lack of cohesion and stability, reflecting the fragile nature of earthly powers.<p><b>and crushed them</b><br>The crushing of the statue signifies the complete and decisive destruction of human kingdoms by the divine kingdom. This act of crushing is not partial but total, indicating the finality and supremacy of God's rule. It echoes the biblical theme of God's ultimate victory over earthly powers, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our Lord.

The king&#8217;s continuous gaze underscores God&#8217;s intention to make the coming revelation unforgettable (compare <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>: &#8220;As you, O king, were watching&#8230;&#8221;). The vision is not an abstract teaching but a divinely broadcasted event meant for eyewitness confirmation. That same pattern of God revealing future events to pagans so they might acknowledge Him can be seen in <a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25&#8211;32</a> (Pharaoh&#8217;s dreams) and in <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10&#8211;11</a>, where shepherds are shown Messiah&#8217;s arrival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a stone was cut out</b><p>The metals of the statue portray successive human empires (vv. 32&#8211;33), yet the next &#8220;kingdom&#8221; appears as a stone, signaling a radically different nature:<p>&#8226; Stones in Scripture often symbolize the Messiah: <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>.<p>&#8226; Unlike precious metals, the stone is ordinary in appearance, reflecting the humble arrival of Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-45.htm">Daniel 2:45</a> clarifies that this same stone &#8220;became a great mountain and filled the whole earth,&#8221; matching the global, unending reign predicted in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6&#8211;7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but not by human hands</b><p>The phrase stresses divine origin. As <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11</a> reminds us, Christ entered &#8220;a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands.&#8221; Likewise <a href="/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a> records Jesus speaking of a temple &#8220;not made with hands.&#8221; God alone fashions this kingdom.

Prophetically, this aligns with:<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23&#8211;27</a>, where the last beast is shattered by the coming Son of Man.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12&#8211;14</a>, where ten kings unite briefly before the Lamb conquers them.<p>The timing shows Messiah&#8217;s direct intervention at history&#8217;s climax, not gradually but decisively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and crushed them</b><p>The result is total demolition, leaving no trace of the world&#8217;s proudest systems (<a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>). Other passages echo this final defeat: <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, &#8220;You will break them with an iron scepter&#8221;; <a href="/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a>, &#8220;For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish&#8221;; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where Christ &#8220;treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God.&#8221; The crushing signifies permanent replacement, not mere reform.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a> pictures the sudden, divine arrival of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. While human empires rise and fall, the Messiah&#8212;God&#8217;s stone, uncut by human hands&#8212;strikes at the zenith of mankind&#8217;s self-made power, toppling every rival authority. His dominion is supernatural in origin, irresistible in action, and eternal in duration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Thou sawest.--</span>Literally, the king <span class= "ital">kept on gazing</span> in wonder at the image.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</span> Practically, the versions are at one with the Massoretic text in regard to this verse, save that the two Greek versions add, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "out of the mountain" Concerning the Chaldee text, we would remark that in the dual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">biydayin</span>), the dual has disappeared in the Aramaic of the Targums. <span class="accented">Thou sawest till</span> implies some time of contemplation and wonder. The king saw this gigantic statue, not possessing the attributes of any of his national gods, and he looks on in his dream in wonder and awe. <span class="accented">Till a stone cut out without hands.</span> The Greek versions make an addition which seems necessary to the sense - "out of the mountain." This addition may certainly have been made from the later verse (ver. 45). The logical necessity, however, may have prompted this addition. On the other hand, the evidence of both the Greek versions agreeing in one addition ha. very considerable weight. It is not impossible that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">mitturah</span>), "from the mountain," had dropped from the manuscripts used by the Massoretes. In favour of the Massoretic text is the fact that the Peshitta omits the word. On the other band, Jerome adds de monte. It may be noted, as at least a curiosity, that the Peshitta, instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">aben</span>)," a stone," gives <span class="accented">kepha</span>, from which Cephas, the name of the Apostle Peter, is derived. As the monarch gazes at the huge image, he <span class="accented">sees</span> behind the image a mountain towering above the image, huge as it is. From this mountain he sees a boulder detach itself, as if it were being cut with chisel and wedge, but no hands are risible. Once set loose from the mountain's side, it came by bounds and leaps down the declivity, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">smote the image</span> upon <span class="accented">his feet that were of iron and clay."</span> Every bound that the stone makes down the mountain is larger, and raises it higher and makes it strike the earth with more of force, till with a bound greater than any it had made before, it strikes the feet of the image, "which were of iron <span class="accented">and</span> clay" mingled, yet separate - and at once they are broken in pieces: "utterly crushed" is the meaning of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">duq</span>). The Septuagint tendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "ground;" it occurs in <a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>, of Moses grinding the golden calf to powder. Theodotion's word is not a correct rendering of the word; it is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "beat into thin scales;" comp. <a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>:(42) 45 ("the stone which the builders rejected"), "on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." It is to be observed that this cutting of the stone out of the mountain took place after the fourth portion of the image was clearly visible. In the dream the catastrophe took place after the stone had been cut from the mountain and had bounded down its side.
