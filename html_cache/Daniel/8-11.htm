Historically, this is associated with Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his arrogance and self-exaltation.

In the context of Antiochus IV, this can be seen in his attempts to suppress Jewish worship and impose Hellenistic practices, directly opposing the God of Israel. This phrase also foreshadows the Antichrist, who will similarly exalt himself against God (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p><b>it removed His daily sacrifice</b><br>The daily sacrifice refers to the continual burnt offerings that were central to Jewish worship in the temple (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>).

Antiochus IV's actions included the desecration of the temple, which involved setting up an altar to Zeus and sacrificing unclean animals. This historical event is a type of future desecration prophesied to occur during the end times, as seen in <a href="/revelation/13-6.htm">Revelation 13:6</a>.

There is a difference here between the Q'ri and the K'thib. The latter reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, while the former reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal of the same verb At first sight the difficulty is not lessened by consideration of the versions. The Septuagint as it at present stands is utterly unintelligible, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and by him everlasting mountains were broken down, and their place and sacrifice taken away, and he placed it in the very ground, and he prospered [reading with Syriac] and was, and the holy place shall be laid waste." This confusion is due to confluence of readings, and is not difficult to disentangle with the help of the Massoretic text. Up to the last two words the Septuagint is a translation of a text differing from the Massoretic simply by intelligible variations and repetitions not uncommon in the Septuagint. The first clause of the LXX. originally was probably, "Till the prince shall deliver the captivity," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">shebee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (tzaba) - a scribe, finding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span> in his Hebrew, then added the translation of it to the margin of his Greek copy, from which it got into the text. The original of the LXX. had also <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">yatztzeel</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">hig'deel</span>) - a confusion easily made in the elder script, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> were like. We learn from the Talmud (<span class="accented">Shabb.</span>, 103b) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> was liable to be mistaken by scribes for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>. Moreover, "captivity" would naturally suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;</span>, "<span class="accented">to deliver."</span> The second clause is, "By him the everlasting mountains were broken down." Here <span class="accented">hayreem</span> has been read with the K'thib, and vocalized as if it were <span class="accented">hareem</span>, and <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "continual," translated as equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> ('<span class="accented">olam</span>), "everlasting." The next clause reveals the other meaning of <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "sacrifice," which probably had been written on the margin, and then dropped into the text. The latter part of the Septuagint verse appears to be confused with the latter part of the following verse according to the Massoretes. Theodotion is even less intelligible than the Septuagint, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and through him the sacrifice was broken down, and he prospered, and the holy place shall be made desolate." It is to be noticed that the first clause here agrees with the LXX. It is possible that "and he prospered" is a doublet, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> being read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in some copy. The Peshitta differs from beth the Greek versions, "Until it arrive to the chiefs of the host, and by it was set up in perpetuity, and preparing he strengthened the sanctuary," and while it is difficult to understand the origin of the variation in the first clause, it is clear that in the second clause the translator must have read <span class="accented">hish-leem</span> for <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> The one thing that seems clear is that the reading of the K'thib is to be preferred. We should read <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, not <span class="accented">hooram.</span> Only the first of these could be read "mountains." If we translate the words as they stand, we shall certainly be removed out of the region of all the commentators. It is assumed that "the little horn" is the subject of this sentence; but "horn" is feminine in Hebrew, and the verbs here are in the masculine; this is against it being the nominative. The "prince of the host," then, must be the nominative of the verbs and subject of the sentence. The rendering of the first clause ought to be, then, "Until the prince of the host magnify himself (<a href="/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>), and by himself he shall offer the daily sacrifice. And he shall cast down the foundation of his holy place," reading <span class="accented">hishlayk instead</span> of <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> We should feel strongly in. clined to transfer the first "and" to <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, and, changing the punctuation, read, "Until the prince of the host shall make himself greater than he" - viz, the tyrant represented by "the little horn" - "and shall offer the daily sacrifice." If we might read <span class="accented">hishleem</span> with the Peshitta instead of <span class="accented">hoosh-lak</span>, we get a satisfactory meaning to the last clause, in which case we should render, "He shall complete the place of his sanctuary." We would understand by "complete," "to perfectly purify." Taking the Massoretic text thus with little modification, we have a description of the successes of Judas Maccabseus, who was prince of the host, and as such became stronger than Epiphanes, and then cleansed the temple, and offered the continual daily sacrifice. We give, as a curiosity, the note of Saadiah Gaon: "The King of Ishmael was more powerful than the kings of Rome who had Jerusalem, and he took Jerusalem from them by force." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It magnified itself,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7713;&#183;d&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1431.htm">Strong's 1431: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow up, become great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
