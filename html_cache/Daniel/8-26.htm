The "evenings and mornings" likely refer to the 2,300 days mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>). The assurance that the vision "is true" emphasizes the certainty and divine origin of the prophecy. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's word is trustworthy and will come to pass (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). The historical fulfillment of these prophecies, particularly the rise of Alexander the Great and the subsequent division of his empire, underscores the accuracy of the vision.<p><b>Now you must seal up the vision,</b><br>Sealing the vision indicates that it is to be preserved and protected for future understanding. In ancient times, sealing a document was a way to authenticate and secure it. This act suggests that the full understanding of the vision was not meant for Daniel's immediate audience but for those in the future who would witness its fulfillment. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, where John is told not to seal up the prophecy because the time is near, contrasting with Daniel's instruction due to the distant nature of the events.<p><b>for it concerns the distant future.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "distant future" indicates that the events described in the vision would not occur in Daniel's lifetime but would unfold over centuries. This points to the period of the Greek Empire and the subsequent events leading up to the time of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the Jewish temple. The distant fulfillment also suggests a typological foreshadowing of future events, possibly relating to end-times prophecy and the Antichrist, as seen in the broader eschatological themes of the book of Daniel. This dual fulfillment perspective is common in biblical prophecy, where immediate historical events prefigure ultimate eschatological realities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The rendering of the LXX. here is, "The vision of the evening and morning was found true, and the vision has been secured for many days." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">asher ne'emar</span>) has been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, although it is difficult to see the genesis of such a reading from the Massoretic , or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> The LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> ought to be observed - not "shut up," in the sense of being "sealed," but "defended from interference by being secured as with a hedge." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text, but have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, construct of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">The vision of the evening and the morning</span> refers to ver. 14. The phrase used. here differs by the insertion of the definite article: but this merely intimates a reference. This statement does not mean that the period indicated by the two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings would end with the death of Antiochus. Certainly, his death occurred in the year following the cleansing of the temple (1 Macc. 6:16). If the writer reckons the beginning of the year according to the Macedonian Calendar, almost a year must have elapsed between the temple-cleansing and the death of Antiochus; but it is the cleansing that is the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span>, not the death of Antiochus. The pollution of the temple was the event that, of all others, would be trying to the faith and patience of Jewish believers; therefore attention is directed to this. As the beginning of this season of trial is the point to which the whole history of the Greek Empire travels, so the termination of this desecration is the end contemplated. <span class="accented">Shut thou up the vision.</span> Certainly the verb <span class="accented">satham</span> means sometimes "to hide;" and it is also certain that it is a characteristic of apocalyptic literature to contain, in the text, elaborate directions fur hiding the vision; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Apocalypse of Moses. It has been argued that this is a preparation for the publication of Daniel in the age of the Maccabees, so long after the date at which it purports to be written. But there is no description of how the book is to be hidden, as in the <span class="accented">Assumption</span> of Moses. Moreover, the translators of the LXX. did not understand <span class="accented">satham as</span> "hide." If it had been hidden, and had been discovered, he would have known and translated accordingly. Then when we turn to the next verse, we find that Daniel himself did not understand the command as meaning that he was to keep the vision secret from his contemporaries; so far from that being the case, one at' his reasons for distress is that no one understood the vision. <span class="accented">The vision shall be far many days.</span> That is to say, that a long interval divided the time when the revelation was made from the time of its fulfilment (<a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>); the vision he sees is for many days to come. Before the beginning of the history revealed to Daniel, certainly not many years intervened; but between the days of Belshazzar and those of Antiochus was an interval of approximately four centuries. The Persian Empire rose and fell, and the Macedonian Empire rose and was approaching its fall. At the end of the period, the light of the vision fell most clearly. It was not necessary that Daniel should know the events portrayed to foretell them truly, any more than it was needful that the Second Isaiah should know the exact historical events portrayed so clearly in his fifty-third chapter. Daniel could not fail to know of Persia, and it even did not require more than a knowledge of the past, and ordinary powers of political forecast, to see that Cyrus might, and probably would, found a world-empire. He knew of the Greeks: there were Greeks in the army of Nebuchadnezzar. Moreover, we learn from Herodotus (1:77) that Nabu-nahid Labynetus had made an alliance with Croesus, in order to check the advance of Cyrus. We know from Herodotus (1:26, 27) that Croesus subdued all the Greek cities in <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor. To Daniel, who possibly had favoured this alliance with the Western monarch, the King of Javan would mean, not Alexander the Great, as it means to us, but Croesus. But his hopes that Babylon will be delivered by the help of Croesus are shown to be groundless, by the intimation that it will be "for many days." The intimation that he had made to Belshazzar, of the interpretation of the inscription on the palace wall, did not necessarily, in his mind, militate against the hope that repentance might lead to respite. Daniel may have made use of political expedients to help in the result he wished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mar&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
