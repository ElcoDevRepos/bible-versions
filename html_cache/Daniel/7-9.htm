It suggests a continuous revelation, emphasizing the importance of the vision's unfolding events. Daniel's role as a prophet is highlighted here, as he is given insight into divine mysteries.<p><b>thrones were set in place</b><br>The mention of multiple thrones suggests a heavenly court setting, possibly indicating the presence of divine beings or angelic hosts. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages that describe God's throne room, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where God's sovereignty and authority are emphasized.<p><b>and the Ancient of Days took His seat</b><br>The title "Ancient of Days" refers to God, emphasizing His eternal nature and wisdom. This imagery portrays God as the ultimate judge and ruler, seated in authority. The concept of God as the Ancient of Days is unique to Daniel and underscores His timeless existence and supreme power.<p><b>His clothing was white as snow</b><br>White clothing symbolizes purity, holiness, and righteousness. This description aligns with other biblical depictions of divine beings, such as in <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, where Christ is described similarly. The purity of God's character is a central theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>and the hair of His head was like pure wool</b><br>The imagery of wool further emphasizes purity and wisdom. In ancient cultures, white hair was often associated with age and wisdom, reinforcing the depiction of God as the all-knowing Ancient of Days. This description also connects to the portrayal of Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, suggesting a typology of Christ as divine.<p><b>His throne was flaming with fire</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol of God's presence, judgment, and holiness. It represents purification and the consuming nature of God's righteousness. This imagery is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> and the fiery presence on Mount Sinai.<p><b>and its wheels were all ablaze</b><br>The wheels suggest movement and the omnipresence of God's throne, similar to the vision of <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where the wheels signify God's ability to be everywhere and see everything. The blazing wheels emphasize the dynamic and active nature of God's rule and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.">Psalm 55:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm" title="The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>.) It may be remarked that notwithstanding the title "Ancient" is applied to the Deity, "Anou," yet His titles, "generator and father of the gods," are so completely at variance with Old Testament doctrines that it is inconceivable that Daniel should have incorporated in his vision any portions of Babylonian mythology. Similar remarks apply to Silik-moulou-khi, between whom and the Son of man (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>) a parallel has been pointed out. The conception of the former is completely different from what is revealed about the latter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span> The Septuagint Version here does not differ much from the Massoretic save that there are two cases of-doublet. Theodotion and the Peshitta are evidently translated from a text identical with that of the Massoretic. There is, however, one point where the versions agree against the Authorized Version - the thrones are not cast down, they are "placed," as in the Revised. Luther and most German commentators render thus, as does Jerome. Ewald translates "cast," that is, "set." In the third chapter, where we have the same word, it means" cast down; "this leads us to prefer the Authorized rendering. The word for "throne" is to be observed. It means not so much the throne-royal as the seat of a judge (Behrmann); but the office of judge was that essentially of the king. <span class="accented">The Ancient of days did sit.</span> It is not "<span class="accented">the</span> Ancient of days," but "one ancient in days," that is to say, the phrase is not appellative, but descriptive. After the thrones of these earlier kingdoms were cast down, then one appeared like an old man clad in a garment of snowy whiteness, and the hair of his head as wool. That this is a symbolic appearance of God is beyond doubt. Ewald remarks on the grandeur of the description as excelling in boldness even the vision of Ezekiel. The throne, the judgment-seat of the Ancient of days, is a chariot of "fiery flame," with "wheels of burning fire" - a description that suggests the translation of Elijah. His throne is at once the judge's scat and the chariot of the warrior. From beneath this chariot-throne "a fiery stream issued forth." In the Book of Revelation (<a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>), from beneath the throne of God there issued the river of the water of life, clear as crystal Compare with this also Enoch 14:9-22. Enoch's description is derived from this, but amplified to a great extent. <span class="accented">Thousand thousands ministered unto him</span>, <span class="accented">and ten thousand times tea thousand stood before him.</span> The word "thousands" in the Aramaic has the Hebrew plural termination in the K'thib, but in the most ancient forms of Aramaic there are many points where the two tongues have not yet diverged. The symbol here is of a royal court, only the numbers are vaster than any earthly court could show. The angels of God are present to carry out the decisions of the judgment. Compare with this Enoch 1:9 (Charles's trans), "Lo! he comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment upon them." Those that minister unto the Judge are those whose duty it is to carry out the Divine sentence; those who stand before him are those who are spectators of this great assize. <span class="accented">The judgment was set.</span> This translation is not accurate. The word translated "was set" is the same as that rendered in the second clause of the preceding verse "did sit." Again, although <span class="accented">deena</span>, thus vocalized, means "judgment," it may be differently vocalized, <span class="accented">dayyana</span>, and mean "Judge." If we take the present pointing, the phrase may be taken as equivalent to "the assize began." <span class="accented">And the books were opened.</span> It ought to be noted that the word here used for" books" is derived from a root primarily meaning "engrave." The Babylonian books, as they have come down to us, are clay tablets "engraved" or "impressed" with letters. We have all manner of legal documents in this form. The piles of tiles and cylinders which contain the deeds of those before the judgment-seat stand before the Judge. One by one they are displayed before him. The scene presented is one of unspeakable grandeur, and all put before us with a few masterly strokes. We see the great fiery throne'; the Judge, awful with the dignity of unnumbered ages, attended by a million of angels who are ready to do his will; and a hundred million watching and listening spectators. We find that this description of the judgment in the first Apocalypse reappears, modified and made yet more solemn, in the last Apocalypse. We are, however, not to regard this as the final judgment. Daniel is rather admitted into the presence of God in the heavens, and sees his judgment continually being prepared against the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5705.htm">Strong's 5705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Even to, until</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I continued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;w&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become, come to pass, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to watch:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;z&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2370.htm">Strong's 2370: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze upon, mentally to dream, be usual</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Thrones</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;s&#257;&#183;w&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3764.htm">Strong's 3764: </a> </span><span class="str2">A throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were set in place,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;m&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7412.htm">Strong's 7412: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw, set, assess</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the Ancient</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
