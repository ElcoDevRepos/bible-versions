The tree symbolizes his vast empire and influence. In biblical symbolism, trees often represent leaders or nations (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). The use of a tree highlights the king's role as a provider and protector, much like a tree offers shelter and sustenance. This metaphor is a common literary device in ancient Near Eastern texts, emphasizing the king's central role in the prosperity of his realm.<p><b>For you have become great and strong;</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's greatness and strength are acknowledged here, reflecting his successful military campaigns and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. Historically, Nebuchadnezzar was known for his architectural achievements, including the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and his military prowess. This phrase underscores the king's power and the stability he brought to his empire, aligning with the biblical theme of God allowing rulers to rise for His purposes (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>your greatness has grown to reach the sky,</b><br>This hyperbolic expression indicates the vastness of Nebuchadnezzar's power and influence. It echoes the Tower of Babel narrative (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>), where human ambition sought to reach the heavens. The phrase suggests both the king's unparalleled success and a warning against pride. In biblical literature, reaching the sky often symbolizes human attempts to rival divine authority, a theme that foreshadows Nebuchadnezzar's impending humbling.<p><b>and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.</b><br>This statement highlights the extensive reach of Nebuchadnezzar's rule, which was one of the largest empires of the ancient world. The phrase "ends of the earth" is a common biblical expression denoting vast territorial control (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>). It also reflects the prophetic vision of God's ultimate dominion over all nations (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>). This global dominion prefigures the universal reign of Christ, who is described as having authority over all creation (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who is the subject of Daniel's interpretation.

The extent of his dominions may be estimated with tolerable accuracy as follows:--Northwards he possessed Armenia, and a considerable portion of Asia Minor; in the west, Syria, and at one time Egypt; southwards, his power reached the Persian Gulf; while in the east, the Medes and Elamites were subject to him. Possessing, as he did, the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, all the treasures of the known world were at his command. In his first vision he was represented as the golden head of the image. In his pride he desired the whole image to be of gold, and himself to be the image--but this was the sin for which he was to suffer.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ant-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_607.htm">Strong's 607: </a> </span><span class="str2">You </span><br /><br /><span class="word">O king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are [that tree]!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_607.htm">Strong's 607: </a> </span><span class="str2">You </span><br /><br /><span class="word">For you have become great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7687;ay&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7236.htm">Strong's 7236: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and strong;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1425;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#601;t)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
