The "he" in this passage is likely Ptolemy III Euergetes of Egypt, who invaded the Seleucid Empire and took spoils back to Egypt. The act of taking gods captive signifies the transfer of religious symbols and idols, which was a common practice in ancient warfare to demonstrate dominance over a conquered people. This event is consistent with historical records of Ptolemy III's campaign against the Seleucid Empire around 246-241 BC.<p><b>with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold</b><br>The mention of "metal images" and "precious vessels" highlights the wealth and religious artifacts that were often seized during military conquests. These items were not only valuable in terms of material wealth but also held significant cultural and religious importance. The taking of such items would have been a severe blow to the Seleucid Empire, both economically and spiritually. This practice of seizing valuable religious artifacts is also seen in other biblical accounts, such as when the Babylonians took treasures from the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>).<p><b>For some years he will stay away from the king of the North</b><br>The "king of the North" refers to the Seleucid rulers, who controlled the northern territories relative to Egypt. The phrase indicates a period of peace or non-aggression between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms following Ptolemy III's successful campaign. This temporary cessation of hostilities allowed both kingdoms to consolidate power and resources. The historical context suggests that after his victories, Ptolemy III focused on internal affairs and strengthening his own kingdom, rather than continuing aggressive expansion. This period of relative peace aligns with the broader narrative of shifting power dynamics in the Hellenistic world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/he.htm">He</a></b><br>Refers to a king from the South, traditionally understood as the Ptolemaic king of Egypt, who will carry out the actions described in the verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/their_gods.htm">Their gods</a></b><br>The deities worshiped by the people of the North, likely representing the Seleucid Empire, which was in conflict with the Ptolemaic Kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, a significant power in the Hellenistic world, often in conflict with the Seleucid Empire.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/metal_images_and_precious_articles.htm">Metal images and precious articles</a></b><br>These represent the wealth and religious artifacts taken as spoils of war, indicating a significant victory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>Typically identified with the Seleucid kings, who were adversaries of the Ptolemaic rulers during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>The capture of gods and idols highlights the powerlessness of man-made deities.

History points to Ptolemy III, who in 246&#8211;245 BC marched deep into Seleucid territory and removed thousands of cult images. This fulfills the pattern God often follows when exposing false worship:<p>&#8226; God humiliates idols to prove they are powerless (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-12.htm">Jeremiah 43:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Carried-off gods can&#8217;t defend themselves (<a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as the Philistines once stole the ark and suffered for it (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-4</a>), so these images are shown to be nothing more than baggage in the hands of a conquering king.<p>The prophecy underscores the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty over nations and their deities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold</b><p>Along with the idols come their ornate coverings and temple treasures. Ptolemy reportedly retrieved 40,000 talents of silver and 2,500 precious objects. Scripture often links idolatry to material splendor that dazzles but cannot save:<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar looted Jerusalem&#8217;s temple vessels (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>) and Belshazzar later profaned them (<a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; When Judah fell, every remaining &#8220;precious vessel&#8221; was carted off to Babylon (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows such plunder to show how quickly earthly wealth changes hands (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>).<p>Daniel&#8217;s words are fulfilled with striking precision: idols, images, silver, and gold all make the trip south.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For some years he will stay away from the king of the North</b><p>After the campaign, the southern king returns home and, as Daniel notes, &#8220;stays away&#8221;&#8212;there is a pause in hostilities. Ptolemy III remained in Egypt for several years, content with his victories and spoils:<p>&#8226; The respite mirrors earlier biblical lulls in warfare, such as the &#8220;three years without war&#8221; between Aram and Israel (<a href="/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1</a>) or the &#8220;rest&#8221; periods in Judges (<a href="/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This break fulfills the Lord&#8217;s timing in the ongoing South-North struggle outlined throughout <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>.<p>&#8226; It also highlights God&#8217;s control of international affairs; even aggressive emperors move only as far and as long as He permits (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a> foretells a southern king&#8217;s stunning triumph: capturing northern idols, hauling off their lavish treasures, and then withdrawing for an extended season. History confirms the prophecy in Ptolemy III&#8217;s victories, while Scripture&#8217;s cross-references remind us that God alone is sovereign over nations, wealth, and false gods. He allows idols to be shamed, riches to be transferred, and wars to pause&#8212;all to display His unrivaled authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He shall continue.</span>--Apparently the meaning is (comp. the use of the preposition in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>) "He shall stand on the side of [<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as an ally of] the northern king several years." Others translate, "He shall abstain from the king of the north some years." In either case the sense is nearly the same. The reference is said to be to the cessation of hostilities between Ptolemy and Seleucus, but there is nothing in these verses which leads us to infer what history states as a fact, that the northern king was completely crippled by a serious defeat, and that his fleet was dispersed by a storm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their</span> <span class="cmt_word">princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</span> The version of the LXX. is again very different from that of the Massoretic text, "And their gods, with them that moulded them, he shall subdue (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and their multitudes with the vessels of their desirable things, the silver and the gold, shall go into captivity in Egypt, and the year shall be to the king of the north." Theodotion. as so frequently is the case, takes a place intermediate between the Massoretic and the version of the LXX. His rendering is, "And their gods, with those that moulded them, all their desirable vessels of gold and silver, he shall carry with the captivity into Egypt, and he shall prevail over the king of the north." Both the Greek versions take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nesikhayhem</span>) as derived from <span class="accented">nasak</span>, "to pour out," hence "to mould," "to form a molten image," reading the word <span class="accented">noskeem.</span> The Syriac differs from both the Greek renderings and also from the Massoretic, "And even he shall terrify them, and their desirable vessels of silver and gold and the captives he shall carry down to Egypt, and twice (literally, 'one, two') shall rise against the king of the north." The Vulgate differs in meaning from all the preceding, but the text it is drawn from does not differ consonantly from that of the Massoretes, "And besides their gods. and their graven images, precious vessels too of silver and gold, he shall lead captive into Egypt, he shall prevail against the king of the north." The word <span class="accented">n'sikhayeem</span> is rendered, in the Revised Version, 'molten images' - a meaning given to the word by Furst, Gesenius, and Winer, with reference to this verse. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized is drawn from Rashi, and is in accordance with the usage of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 32:30). <span class="accented">And shall also carry caprices into Egypt their gods</span>, <span class="accented">with their princes.</span> As we have said, Ptolemy Euergetes conquered all Syria and Mesopotamia to beyond the Tigris. From this we learn he carried off immense booty, and among the articles taken were images of their gods. And not only the gods of Syria, but the images of the Egyptian gods, which had been carried into Syria from Egypt by Cambyses, nearly three centuries before. If this doubtful word, <span class="accented">nasakeem</span>, is taken to mean "images," it is difficult to see the reference of the prenominal suffix. Does it mean that the gods themselves, and the images of these gods, were taken? That is to say, does it mean that gods of the Syrians were taken, and also their images, as if the images and the gods were different? From this, notwithstanding the general consensus of interpreters, we feel ourselves necessitated to differ, and to make the word mean "princes," although there is no prominence, in the few accounts we have of this expedition, to any captives of such rank as to be called princes. <span class="accented">And with their precious vessels of silver and of gold.</span> This rendering, although retained in the Revised, is scarcely grammatically accurate, as the noun for "vessels" is already defined by the prenominal suffix. On the other hand, this word cannot readily be in apposition, as the article would be needed. Professor Bevan would make it "in silver and gold." We feel inclined to regard this as a somewhat irregular construction, as if a <span class="accented">ray</span> had dropped out before <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, "silver," though most of the versions regard these nouns as in the genitive after "vessels." <span class="accented">And he shall continue more years than the king of the north</span> It is a matter of fact that Euergetes survived Seleueus Callinicus, his sister's stepson, about four years. Hitzig and Ewald would render," He shall refrain for some years from attacking the king of the north." This rendering has the advantage that it escapes from the purely unimportant personal statement that Ptolemy should survive Callinicus. That the king of the north was allotted to regain the greater part of the dominions which had been wrested from him, without any counter effort on the part of Ptolemy, is more important.
