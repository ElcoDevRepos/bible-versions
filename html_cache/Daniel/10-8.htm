This mirrors other biblical figures like Moses and Elijah, who also experienced profound moments with God when alone. The isolation emphasizes the personal nature of the vision and the unique calling of Daniel as a prophet.<p><b>gazing at this great vision</b><br>The vision Daniel sees is overwhelming in its grandeur, suggesting a divine or heavenly origin. In biblical terms, visions often convey messages from God, and their greatness underscores the importance of the revelation. This aligns with other prophetic visions in the Bible, such as those in Ezekiel and Revelation, which also depict awe-inspiring scenes.<p><b>No strength remained in me</b><br>The physical weakness Daniel experiences is a common reaction to divine encounters, as seen with other prophets like Isaiah and John. This indicates the overwhelming power and holiness of the vision, which human frailty cannot withstand. It highlights the contrast between divine strength and human weakness.<p><b>my face grew deathly pale</b><br>This phrase suggests fear and awe, common responses to the divine presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, paleness often symbolized fear or impending doom. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter angels or divine beings, such as the shepherds in <a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2</a>.<p><b>and I was powerless</b><br>Daniel's powerlessness underscores the humbling effect of encountering the divine. It reflects the biblical theme of human dependence on God's strength. This moment of weakness is a precursor to receiving divine strength, as seen in other scriptures where God empowers those He calls, such as Gideon and Paul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision.

The effects of the vision upon him are also mentioned. His "comeliness was turned," or, he grew pale with terror at what he saw, and fainted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</span> The versions do not call for much remark. The LXX. renders "glory" by "spirit" or "breath;" and the Peshitta renders it by "body." The Massoretic is superior, as more difficult and more likely to be the source of the other two than either of them. Theodotion's rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, confirms this. Daniel explains how he alone had seen the vision, and narrates the effects contact with the spiritual had on him, "There remained no strength in me;... And I retained no strength" - a redoubled statement of weakness not necessarily meaning, as Jephet-ibn-Ali would have it, that the one refers to his inability <span class="accented">to</span> flee like his attendants, and the other to his inability to stand upright. It is probably due merely to the great impression this sudden powerlessness made on him. <span class="accented">For my comeliness was turned in me into corruption.</span> From the natural brightness of the skin in life the face assumed the yellow pallor of death (comp. <a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>).
