The king, Belshazzar, and his nobles are in a state of alarm due to the mysterious writing on the wall. This reflects the instability and fear that can accompany divine intervention. Historically, this event occurs during the fall of Babylon, a time of great political upheaval. The outcry signifies the desperation and helplessness of human power when confronted with the divine.<p><b>the queen entered the banquet hall</b><br>The queen here is likely the queen mother, possibly Nitocris, the wife of Nabonidus and mother of Belshazzar. Her entrance signifies wisdom and authority, as she is not part of the initial revelry but comes in response to the crisis. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the queen mother often held significant influence and respect. Her presence suggests a stabilizing force amid chaos, reminiscent of other wise women in Scripture, such as Deborah or Esther.<p><b>&#8220;O king, may you live forever!&#8221; she said.</b><br>This traditional greeting reflects the customary way of addressing a monarch, expressing loyalty and respect. It is a formal salutation that acknowledges the king's authority, even in a moment of distress. This phrase is common in ancient royal courts, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm">Nehemiah 2:3</a>, emphasizing the continuity of royal protocol.<p><b>&#8220;Do not let your thoughts terrify you, or your face grow pale.&#8221;</b><br>The queen offers reassurance and counsel, urging the king not to succumb to fear. This reflects a biblical theme where God's messengers often begin with words of comfort, such as "Do not be afraid" (e.g., <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>, <a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>). Her advice suggests a call to faith and calmness in the face of divine mystery. The pale face symbolizes fear and anxiety, common human reactions to the unknown, which are addressed throughout Scripture with calls to trust in God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen.htm">The Queen</a></b><br>Likely the queen mother, possibly the widow of Nebuchadnezzar, who enters the scene with wisdom and authority to address the king's distress.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_belshazzar.htm">King Belshazzar</a></b><br>The reigning king of Babylon, who is troubled by the mysterious writing on the wall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet_hall.htm">The Banquet Hall</a></b><br>The setting of the lavish feast where the writing on the wall appears, causing fear and confusion among the attendees.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nobles.htm">The Nobles</a></b><br>The high-ranking officials and guests present at the feast, who are also perplexed by the supernatural event.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_writing_on_the_wall.htm">The Writing on the Wall</a></b><br>A divine message that appears during the feast, interpreted later by Daniel, signifying God's judgment on Belshazzar's reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_times_of_crisis.htm">Wisdom in Times of Crisis</a></b><br>The queen demonstrates the importance of wisdom and calmness in the face of fear and uncertainty.

The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Sin&#8217;s celebrations end in fear, but God sends voices of truth.<p>&#8226; Respectful courage gains a hearing even in hostile halls.<p>&#8226; Real peace is impossible until God&#8217;s message is heeded.<p>By following her example&#8212;listening for distress, stepping in with honor, and pointing trembling hearts to God&#8212;we become instruments through which He turns panic into opportunity for repentance and salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">By reason of the words.--</span>The noise and confusion in the banquet-hall was heard by the queen-mother in her apartments.

We see the rhetorical character of these verses more clearly when we consider the ineptitude of the special powers ascribed to Daniel to meet the present difficulty. Interpretation of dreams was a common attribute ascribed to wisdom in the East of old, as it is yet. But this was not a dream, and therefore the qualification was not to the purpose; still less to the purpose are the attributes that follow. <span class="accented">Showing of hard sentences.</span> Giving riddles that nobody could read was an evidence of wisdom all over the East (see Josephus, 8:5. 3; besides Talmudic stories of Solomon). This, however, is not a case of competition in riddles; above all, there is no opportunity of one giving riddles in return. "Dissolving of doubts" is the solving of these riddles. These qualities, which the queen-mother, according to the Massoretic text, ascribes to Daniel, might make him delightful as a boon companion, but were not at all to the purpose in the matter troubling the king. The version of the Septuagint is much briefer, and, it seems to us, much more satisfactory, "Then the queen reminded him concerning Daniel, who was of the captivity of Judaea, and said to the king, The man was understanding, wise, and excelling all the wise men of Babylon, and there is a holy spirit in him, and in the days of the king thy father, he showed difficult (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) interpretations to Nebuchadnezzar thy father." This has every sign of having been translated; thus the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>, which we have rendered, "reminded him concerning Daniel." This use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> is unknown in classic Greek. In Homer's 'Odyssey' it is accusative of person; in Plato, 'Laches,' 200 D, it is dative of person; in 'Legg.,' 3:688, it is accusative of person. It is, however, exactly parallel with <a href="/genesis/40-14.htm">Genesis 40:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> in the Hebrew; in the Targum of Onkelos and in the Peshitta this is translated by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>; in Paulus Tellensis it is rendered by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>. Moreover, according to the Massoretic text, Belshazzar asks Daniel if he is" that Daniel which art of the captivity of the children of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?" The queen-mother had said nothing, according to the verses before us as given in the Massoretic recension, of Daniel being a Jew. According to the Septuagint, the queen-mother tells him whence Daniel is. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text, save that it inserts "watchfulness" instead of "light," and omits the repetition of "thy father." The Peshitta is also substantially at one with our received text. One of the great difficulties which commentators have found in this part of the incident is how Belshazzar could be ignorant of Daniel. Various means have been adopted to get over the difficulty. One is that Daniel was away from Babylon up to this time (Jephet-ibn-Ali). Archdeacon Rose is certain he must have known about him. The explanation of this is as recumbent on the opponents of the authenticity of Daniel as on its defenders, for they - the latter - declare it the work of one author, and it has had powerful effect on people: it must be artistically written if it is not a record of facts. No artist in fictitious narrative would present to his readers so obvious a difficulty. We learn now what was the probable reason of Belshazzar's ignorance of Daniel. Nabu-nahid, a usurper, was at variance with the whole clergy, as we may call them, of Babylon, and most likely Daniel acted with the others, and possibly, as far back as the revolution in which Evil-Merodach perished, had been away from the court. It is the height of unfairness of any one to press the name here given to Nebuchadnezzar, "my father." That title was very loosely used among the Babylonians and Assyrians. Jehu is called "the son of Omri," although he had swept the race of Omri off the face of the earth. So Dr. hugo Winckler, in his ' Untersuchungen zur Attorientalischen Geschichte,' p. 53, note, says, "This word 'son' after the name of a Chaldean prince, is only to be taken in the sense of belonging to the same dynasty." Had the phrase used been that "Nebuchadnezzar slept with his fathers, and Belshazzar his son reigned in his stead," something might have been said for the view maintained by all critics, that the author thought Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar. How can the critics assert this, and yet, as does Professor Bevan, maintain this author intimate even with the minutest portions of Jeremiah, Kings, and Chronicles? If so, how is it that he did not know that both Kings and Jeremiah asserted Nebuchadnezzar to have been succeeded by Evil-Merodach? This information occupies too prominent a place in both books for him to have been ignorant of it. We can only understand his action in thus putting down Belshazzar as the son of Nebuchadnezzar by assuming his acceptance of usage. The critics cannot explain it. Those who maintain the traditional view may do so by saying that Daniel, writing at the time, knowing the real state of matters, the claim of Belshazzar to be descended from Nebuchadnezzar, the fact that Evil-Merodach had been killed, simply relates facts. Had he been inventing history, and acquainted with the holy books, and all the information they conveyed to everybody, he would of necessity have spent some pains in explaining how his history came to differ so much from what one could draw from the Books of Kings and Jeremiah. The two accounts of Saul's meeting with David are not comparable with this, as we find the reason of the contradiction in the coalescence of two different accounts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hearing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1459;&#1489;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;qo&#183;&#7687;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6903.htm">Strong's 6903: </a> </span><span class="str2">In front of, before, because of, because that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the outcry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4406.htm">Strong's 4406: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, command, discourse, subject</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his nobles,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ra&#7687;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
