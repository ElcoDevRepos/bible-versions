Daniel, a Jewish exile, held a high position in the Babylonian court, reflecting God's providence in placing him there. His presence signifies the introduction of divine wisdom into a situation where human wisdom had proven inadequate.<p><b>(whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god,</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar had given Daniel the Babylonian name Belteshazzar, which is derived from the name of the Babylonian god Bel (or Marduk). This renaming reflects the cultural assimilation practices of the time, where captives were often given names associated with local deities. It highlights the tension between Daniel's Hebrew identity and his role in a pagan society.<p><b>and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods).</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges a unique spiritual quality in Daniel, recognizing the divine influence in him. This phrase can be seen as a pagan king's attempt to describe the Holy Spirit's work in Daniel using his own religious framework. It underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and presence even in foreign lands, as seen in Joseph's story in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>).<p><b>And I told him the dream:</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's decision to confide in Daniel demonstrates his trust in Daniel's ability to interpret dreams, a gift from God. This act of sharing the dream sets the stage for the revelation of divine truth, similar to how God revealed mysteries through Joseph and other prophets.

Earlier God equipped Daniel &#8220;with insight into all kinds of visions and dreams&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>). The narrative reminds us that:<p>&#8226; consistent integrity keeps doors open for fresh ministry moments.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servants are His ambassadors wherever He places them (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god</b><p>The king still speaks from a polytheistic worldview, calling Daniel by a Babylonian name honoring Marduk.

While the culture tried to rebrand him (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>), Daniel never compromised his allegiance (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).

After every pagan expert fails, Daniel appears&#8212;still labeled by Babylon yet filled with the Spirit of the Living God. His readiness, Spirit-empowered insight, and unwavering identity set the stage for God to humble a king and exalt His own name. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s timing, remain faithful in secular settings, rely on the Spirit&#8217;s power, and speak truth when the moment &#8220;at last&#8221; arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">At the last.</span>--On account of his position as the chief of the governors of the wise men, Daniel would not "come in" till last.<p><span class= "bld">Belteshazzar.--</span>See Note on <a href="/daniel/1-7.htm" title="To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.">Daniel 1:7</a>; Introduction, ? 6.<p><span class= "bld">The spirit</span> . . .--He means his own gods, for though he recognised Jehovah to be a "high God," yet he acknowledged Him only as one out of many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying</span>. This verse is also omitted in the Septuagint. Instead of this verse and those preceding, this verse occurs after the account of the dream, "And when I arose from my couch in the morning, I called Daniel, the ruler of the wise men, and the chief of the interpreters of dreams, and I related to him the dream, and he showed me all the interpretation of it." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The Septuagint arranges differently: instead of deferring the account of the dream till Nebuchadnezzar tells it to Daniel, the account of the dream follows immediately upon the statement of the fact that it had occurred and had troubled the king. In it, as we have seen, there is nothing of the summoning of all the wise men of Babylon in all their various classes. This summoning of the whole college of wise men, astrologers, soothsayers, and Chaldeans, is in obvious contradiction, not only to <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, but also to the ninth verse of the chapter before us. There was no need of summoning the college of augurs until the king had consulted their head. The explanation of these verses and the occasion of their interpolation is not unlike the fact narrated in <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar, on account of his first dream, calls together the wise men - that when he had a dream that troubled him it was natural that Nebuchadnezzar should do as the Septuagint declares he did, summon "Daniel, the ruler of the wise men, and the chief of the interpreters of dreams." One result of which follows, if we discard these verses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that we get rid, in this passage, of the class of "Chaldeans," and further, of the etymology of "Belteshazzar," both of which have been made objections to the authenticity of Daniel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
