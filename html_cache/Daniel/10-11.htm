In the context of <a href="/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, this messenger is often understood to be an angel, possibly Gabriel, who previously appeared to Daniel in earlier visions (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16, 9</a>:21). The role of angels as messengers is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as the angelic visitations to Mary and Joseph in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20-24</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Daniel, you are a man who is highly precious.</b><br>Daniel is described as "highly precious," indicating his esteemed status before God. This reflects Daniel's faithfulness and dedication to God throughout his life, as seen in his refusal to defile himself with the king's food (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>) and his unwavering commitment to prayer (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>). The term "highly precious" underscores the biblical theme that God values those who are righteous and faithful, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>.<p><b>Consider carefully the words that I am about to say to you.</b><br>The instruction to "consider carefully" emphasizes the importance of the message Daniel is about to receive. This reflects the biblical principle of attentiveness to God's word, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-22</a>, where believers are urged to pay attention to wisdom and understanding. The message Daniel receives is part of a larger prophetic revelation concerning future events, highlighting the need for discernment and understanding.<p><b>Stand up, for I have now been sent to you.&#8221;</b><br>The command to "stand up" signifies respect and readiness to receive a message. In biblical times, standing was a posture of attentiveness and reverence, as seen when people stood to hear the reading of the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>). The phrase "I have now been sent to you" indicates divine commissioning, similar to other instances where God sends messengers to deliver important revelations, such as the sending of prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p><b>And when he had said this to me, I stood up trembling.</b><br>Daniel's response of standing "trembling" reflects the awe and fear often experienced in the presence of the divine or angelic beings. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as when the prophet Isaiah encountered God's holiness (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) or when the apostle John fell at the feet of the risen Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The trembling signifies both reverence and the overwhelming nature of the divine encounter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God, known for his unwavering faith and integrity.
