This imagery is consistent with the biblical use of beasts to represent empires or nations, as seen in other prophetic books like Revelation. The use of "great" emphasizes their power and influence over the known world. These beasts are often interpreted as the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, aligning with the vision of the statue in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>.<p><b>came up out of the sea</b><br>The "sea" in biblical prophecy often represents chaos, turmoil, and the masses of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>). The emergence of these beasts from the sea suggests that these empires arise from a world of disorder and conflict. This imagery reflects the ancient Near Eastern view of the sea as a symbol of chaos and evil, which God alone can control (<a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>).<p><b>each one different from the others</b><br>The phrase indicates the distinct characteristics and nature of each kingdom. While they share the commonality of being powerful empires, their differences highlight the unique attributes and historical contexts of each. This diversity can be seen in the varying forms of governance, culture, and impact on Israel and the world. The differences also point to the unfolding of God's sovereign plan through diverse means and rulers, ultimately leading to the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

It must be observed that the beasts do not rise up simultaneously, but in succession to each other. In this way, and in the difference of their character, they form a parallel to the subject-matter of the vision recorded in Daniel 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another</span>. The Septuagint rendering omits "great;" otherwise it is a closely accurate representation of the Massoretic text, save that the translator seems to have had, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>, but as in the Syriac, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, as he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, but does not so slavishly follow the Aramaic construction at the end. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic, save that in the last clause it agrees with the LXX. The number four is, in apocalyptic writings, significant of the world; "the four winds" mean the whole world. Here it is human history that is summed up in the four beasts. So in Zechariah we have "four horns" that symbolize the oppressors of the people of God (<a href="/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>). We have "four" chariots in the sixth chapter of Zechariah, which seem to be symbols of the same thing. <span class="accented">Beasts.</span> Animals of one sort or another are used of nations in the prophets; thus Egypt is symbolized in <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, as "leviathan," presumably a crocodile (<a href="/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>), as "a dragon" in <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> Babylonia is figured as an eagle (<a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>). Composite beings are used as symbols also, as Tyro is addressed as a '"covering cherub." In the Book of Revelation Rome is figured as a beast with seven heads and ten horns (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). In the Book of Enoch (85. - 90.) we find this figurative use of animals carried much further. Assyria and Babylonia and, following them, Persia made great use of composite, monstrous animal forms as symbols, not so much, however, of political as of spiritual powers. This distinction is the less important, that political events were regarded as the production of spiritual activity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_703.htm">Strong's 703: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7687;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7260.htm">Strong's 7260: </a> </span><span class="str2">Very great things </span><br /><br /><span class="word">beasts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1493;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#234;&#183;w&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2423.htm">Strong's 2423: </a> </span><span class="str2">An animal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;q&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5559.htm">Strong's 5559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">out of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sea,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yam&#183;m&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3221.htm">Strong's 3221: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sea, the Mediterranean Sea, large river, an artifical basin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1668.htm">Strong's 1668: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">different</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;y&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8133.htm">Strong's 8133: </a> </span><span class="str2">To change</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the others.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1668.htm">Strong's 1668: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 7:3 Four great animals came up (Dan.
