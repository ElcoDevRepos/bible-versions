In the context of Daniel, "the wise" refers to those who are faithful to God and possess spiritual discernment. Historically, this can be linked to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king who sought to impose Hellenistic culture and religion. The falling of the wise can be seen as a test of faith, similar to the trials faced by early Christians and other biblical figures like Job.<p><b>so that they may be refined, purified, and made spotless</b><br>The process of refining and purifying is a common biblical metaphor for spiritual growth and sanctification. This imagery is used throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>, where God is described as a refiner and purifier of silver. The trials faced by the wise serve to strengthen their faith and character, removing impurities and making them more like Christ. This aligns with the New Testament teachings in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, which speak of trials producing perseverance and maturity.<p><b>until the time of the end</b><br>This phrase indicates that the period of testing and purification has a divine timeline. The "time of the end" is a recurring theme in apocalyptic literature, referring to the culmination of God's plan for history. In Daniel, this often points to the eschatological future when God's kingdom will be fully established. It suggests that the suffering of the wise is temporary and purposeful, leading to a greater fulfillment in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>for it will still come at the appointed time</b><br>This emphasizes God's sovereignty and the certainty of His prophetic timetable. Despite appearances, God's purposes will be accomplished at the precise moment He has determined. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, which speaks of the vision awaiting its appointed time and not proving false. The phrase reassures believers that God's promises are trustworthy and that His plans will unfold according to His perfect timing, offering hope and encouragement amidst trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise.htm">The Wise</a></b><br>Refers to those who have understanding and insight, often seen as faithful believers or leaders who are knowledgeable in God's ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fall.htm">The Fall</a></b><br>Represents trials, persecution, or challenges that the wise will face.

Whilst in <a href="/daniel/11-33.htm" title="And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.">Daniel 11:33</a> it appears that the sufferings of "those that understand" would instruct others, it appears that they would themselves profit by their sufferings. These gradations are mentioned (1) "to try "--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to refine, as a precious metal is refined by fire; (2) "to purge "--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to separate the bad from the good; (3) "to make white"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to cause them to become completely purified. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>). In this way the dissemblers are made known. The patient example of the sufferers is followed by others who are faithful, while the "flatterers" become open apostates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is, "And some of those of understanding shall consider to purify themselves beth to be chosen and to be purified to the time of the end, for the season is for hours." The translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. The reading of the Massoretes is to be preferred. Theodotion's, while closer to the Massoretic text,' is not identical with the sense as represented by the Authorized and Revised Versions, "And some of those of understanding shall be weak to try them, that they may be chosen out and revealed at the end of time, for it yet is for a season." Both Greek versions, as will be seen, render <span class="accented">barar</span>, "choose" - a meaning it has in the pual - and both omit one of the clauses. In this the Greek versions have the support of the Peshitta, which renders, "And (some) of the wise shall be overthrown to choose among them, and that they may understand to the end, because it is again protracted for a season." Here, too, the last of the clauses descriptive of the effect of the fall of the wise is omitted. Although the Vulgate supports the Massoretic in this, we feel it suspicious. <span class="accented">And some of them of understanding shall fall.</span> Though marvellously successful, yet Judas and his comrades suffered some reverses; the reference may be to those that fell in battle. The rendering in Theodotion would seem to point to some apostatizing. We have no record of any such cases, yet it is not impossible that some would fall away. This would be a greater trial than defeat and the death in battle of such heroes as Eleazar, surnamed Avaran, or even of Judas Maccabaeus himself. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">try them</span>, <span class="accented">and to purge</span>, <span class="accented">and to make them white.</span> The death of teachers and of military leaders would be a severe test of the zeal and enthusiasm of the faithful. All the fearful and insincere would fall off from the ranks of the faithful. Those zealous for the Law of God would be at once tried and purified by these untoward events. This has been the experience of the Christian Church in every age. Because more a trial, therefore more purifying would be the failure of some to maintain the faith under trial. <span class="accented">Even to the time of the end</span>: <span class="accented">because it is yet for a time appointed.</span> It is in perfect accordance with the view that the purpose of the death of teachers and leaders, even their failure, is the purification of the saints, that the time of the trial should be fixed and definite. This view is frequent in the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Some of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
