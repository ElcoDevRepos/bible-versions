The king, Nebuchadnezzar, sought understanding from his court advisors, who were part of a class of wise men in Babylon. These individuals were thought to possess knowledge of the supernatural and were often consulted in matters of state and personal concern. The inclusion of various types of practitioners&#8212;magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers&#8212;reflects the diverse religious and cultural influences in Babylon, a center of learning and mysticism. This action underscores the king's desperation and the importance of dreams in ancient royal courts.<p><b>When they came and stood before the king,</b><br>The phrase indicates the formal and hierarchical nature of the Babylonian court. The wise men were summoned to appear before the king, highlighting the authority and power of Nebuchadnezzar. This setting also sets the stage for the unfolding drama where Daniel, a Hebrew captive, would later demonstrate the superiority of the God of Israel over the Babylonian deities and their representatives. The scene foreshadows the limitations of human wisdom and the eventual revelation of divine truth through Daniel, pointing to the theme of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that needed interpretation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/magicians.htm">Magicians</a></b><br>These were wise men or scholars in Babylon who practiced the art of magic and were considered knowledgeable in interpreting dreams.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enchanters.htm">Enchanters</a></b><br>Individuals who used incantations or spells, often seen as possessing special knowledge or powers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sorcerers.htm">Sorcerers</a></b><br>Practitioners of sorcery, often involved in the occult and believed to have the ability to communicate with the spiritual realm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/astrologers.htm">Astrologers</a></b><br>Those who studied the stars and celestial bodies to predict events and interpret dreams.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>The summoning of magicians and astrologers underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the need for divine revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's dream and its interpretation reveal God's control over the rise and fall of empires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_god's_servants.htm">The Role of God's Servants</a></b><br>Like Daniel, believers are called to be vessels of God's wisdom and truth in a world seeking answers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>Christians should exercise discernment and rely on God's Word rather than occult practices for guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Daniel's faithfulness in a foreign land serves as an example of steadfastness in challenging circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_summon_magicians_in_Daniel_2_2.htm">Why did Nebuchadnezzar summon magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers in Daniel 2:2?

They are mentioned by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm" title="But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come on you in their perfection for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great abundance of your enchantments.">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm" title="Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, wherein you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.">Isaiah 47:12</a>) as prevalent in the Babylon of his days. Probably the Chaldaeans spoken of in this verse did not form a separate class of magicians, but denoted the priests, such as those mentioned <span class= "ital">Herod.</span> i. 181, and was contained in the first class of magicians mentioned in the verse. It appears that Daniel excelled (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm" title="As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.">Daniel 1:17</a>) in all classes of magic learning, whether it required a knowledge of "learning, wisdom, or dreams."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</span> The Septuagint renders, "And the king commended that the magicians, astrologers, and sorcerers of the Chaldeans be brought in to tell the king his dream. And they came and steed before the king." The difference is slight verbally, but very important. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree closely with the Massoretic. The Vulgate renders <span class="accented">mecashe-pheem</span>, "sorcerers," <span class="accented">malefici</span>, "evil workers." <span class="accented">Then the king commanded to call the magi</span>cians. The scene seems to stand out before us - the king, excited and sleepless, calling out to his attendants to summon to his presence all the wise men in the capital of his empire. The first that are named are the <span class="accented">hartummeem.</span> The name is derived by Gesenius from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">heret</span>), "a stylus," and he supposes them to be sacred scribes. We find the word in <a href="/genesis/41-24.htm">Genesis 41:24</a>. Although the order may have existed among the Egyptians, the name given to them here and in Exodus may quite well have a Semitic origin. The Tel-el-Amarna tablets show us how well the language of Assyria was known in Egypt. Hitzig is quite sure that Nebuchadnezzar "est Abbild des Pharao und zugleich Vorbild des Antiochus Epiphanes." It is a way critics have; they are always quite sure. It may be observed that both the Greek versions have for this word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "those who use incantations." The Peshitta has <span class="accented">harasha</span>, primarily "one who is silent," then "one who mutters," then "one who sings an incantation." Paulus Tellensis has <span class="accented">lehasha</span>, "to whisper," and then "to reheat a charm" or "incautation." Jerome renders <span class="accented">arioli</span>," foretellers." While the Peshitta interprets <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> in Genesis by the same word as that used here, in the Septuagint the word in Genesis is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fde;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and Jerome uses <span class="accented">conjectores</span> instead of, as we have seen, <span class="accented">arioli</span> In <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a> <span class="accented">harturameem</span> is translated in the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. Jerome renders <span class="accented">ipsi</span>, as if the word had not been in his text. if, then, the word <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> stood in the text of Daniel when the Greek versions were made, there was an uncertainty as to the meaning to be assigned to it in Egypt. The distinction between the two meanings drawn from the etymology of the word <span class="accented">hartummeem</span>, and that derived from the Greek equivalent, is not great. The religion of the Chaldeans was largely a system of incantations that were preserved primarily in the Accadian - a tongue known only to the sacred scribes. Many of the formulae are translated into Assyrian - a language, by the time of Nebuchadnezzar, practically as much restricted to the scribes and learned class as the Accadian. Hence only a scribe could know the proper words to use in an incantation, only he could perpetuate and preserve them. It is difficult to know on what grouted the translators of the Authorized Version selected the word "magicians." The Geneva Bible rendered it "enchanters," which is adopted by the Revisers. Luther is further afield in tendering <span class="accented">sternsehers.</span> The name is Assyrian, and apparently derived from <span class="accented">harutu</span>, "a staff" (Norris, 'Assyr. Dict.'). This staff was possibly used, as the staff of the Roman augur, to mark off the regions of the heavens, or, it may be, to ward off demons. <span class="accented">And the astrologers.</span> The Hebrew word used here is <span class="accented">ashshapheem.</span> "In Assyrian the word <span class="accented">asep</span> or <span class="accented">asipu</span> is used in the sense of diviner. The word was actually borrowed by the Aramaic of Daniel under the form of <span class="accented">ashshaph"</span> (Sayce, 'Hibbert Lecture,' p. 51). It is supposed to mean "one who uses enchantments." It is not Hebrew, but really Syriao or Eastern Aramaic. In both Greek versions the equivalent is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which Jerome follows. The Peshitta reserves <span class="accented">magoeha</span> for the next term. The assertion that this word was really the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is now abandoned. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;</span> never rendered by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which represented a sound not present in Greek at all. The fact that this non-Hellenic sound is doubled makes it utterly impossible that this word could be brought over from the Greek. It is impossible to assign to this word the precise shade of meaning which belongs to it. There is nothing to suggest "astrologers" in the root of the word. <span class="accented">And the sorcerers.</span> The Hebrew here is <span class="accented">mekash</span>,<span class="accented">hepheem.</span> Dr. Robertson Smith, as quoted in Professor Bevan, suggests that the word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5e4;</span>, "to shred or cut to pieces," hence "to prepare magical drugs." This is in agreement with the Greek versions, which render <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb, however, is a Syrian one, and means "to worship" (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>). It occurs in the Hebrew of <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a> along with <span class="accented">hartummeem</span>; in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, in a verse forbidding to the Israelites the use of magical arts; in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>, in an account of how Manasseh traversed that law. It may be noted that in this last verse the Peshitta renders <span class="accented">Chaldea</span> "Chaldeans." Again we have to repeat the remark that we do not know the distinctions involved in these different names. <span class="accented">And the Chaldeans.</span> The Hebrew word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">Kas'deern</span>); both the form <span class="accented">Kassatu</span> and <span class="accented">Kaldu</span> occur in in-seriptions. The meaning of this word has caused great discussion, and its use in this chapter for a class of magicians has been held as a strong proof that the writer of the book before us lived long after the time in which he places the events he narrates. The use of "Chaldean" for "magician," "astrologer," or "soothsayer" in classic times is well known. The difficulty here is that the name "Chaldean" is used for a particular and limited class in the nation, and at the same time for that nation as a whole. This is not necessarily impossible. In Scotland, although the inhabitants are all called Scots, there is also the clan whose surname is Scott, or, as it was earlier spelt, "Scot." It would not show confusion or iguorance did a writer of the fifteenth century speak in one page of the Kers, the Hepburns, and the Scots (Scotts) as forming one army, and then in the next page proceed to speak of the whole army as the army of the Scots. His use of the name in the one case for the nation and the other for the clan, so far from showing an insufficient acquaintance with the constitution of Scotland, or the history of its affairs, really evidences the accuracy of the writer's knowledge. We cannot conclude that the author therefore made a mistake in speaking - if he does so - of a class of the Babylonian magians being called Chaldeans because the nation bore the same name. We certainly have as yet found no trace of such a usage, but the <span class="accented">argumentum e silentio</span> is of strikingly little value in regard to Babylon - her annals are so very incomplete. We retest bear in mind that the text of Daniel is in a very bad state: it has been subjected to various inter-polstions and alterations. It is, therefore, hazardous to rest any stress on single words. It is clear the writer knew perfectly well that the nation were called Chaldeans. According to the Massoretic text, <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a> asserts, "In that night was Belshazzar King of the Chaldeans slain;" according to the LXX. version of the same verse it is, "And the kingdom was taken from the Chaldeans and given to the Medea and Persians." If we are sure the writer did make the Chaldeans also a class of magians, the probability is that he knew what he was talking about, and made no explanation because, as a contemporary, he took for granted everybody knew how this was. But is it absolutely certain that the writer of Daniel does make this asset-lion? It is true that in the Massoretic text the <span class="accented">Kasdeem</span> are represented as a class of magiaas coordinate with the <span class="accented">hartummeem, ashshapheem</span>, and <span class="accented">mekashepheem</span>, but in the Septuagint we find the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the genitive. Consequently, the sentence reads, "the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers of the Chaldeans." If at the time the Massoretic recension was made the name "Chaldean" had gained its later significance of "soothsayer," one can easily understand how natural it would be to insert the copulative before the preposition. The construction of the sentence in the text before the translator of the LXX. Version is certainly irregular, but not unexampled. It is not so easy to imagine the Septuagint translator changing the nominative plural into a genitive, especially when, by the time the translation was made, the osage we have spoken of above was in full force. We may assume, then, that in the original text of Daniel the "Kasdeem" were not spoken of, in this verse at all events, as a class of magicians. As the clause appears in the LXX., Nebuchadnezzar assembled all the magicians of his nationality, the Chaldeans as distinguished from the Babylonians. Perhaps he had more confidence in them. While the change we have suggested would make only the <span class="accented">mekashshepheem</span> connected with the Chaldeans, the grammatical structure of the verse has the aspect of a freer rendering than that in Theodotion' hence it might quite well have been that the original Hebrew had the meaning represented by the Greek of the Septuagint. Lenormant  sees in the four classes here an exact representation of the four classes of Babylonian <span class="accented">soothsayers.</span> We do not feel obliged to maintain that all the different classes should be called in on the occasion of this dream. We do not know precisely the characteristics that separated one class from the other, but it seems little likely that they all devoted themselves to the interpretation of dreams. There were other omens and portents that had to be explained. <span class="accented">For to show the king his dreams.</span> The natural sense is that represented by the Greek versions, "to tell the king his dream." The usual reason for these officials being called was to declare to the king the interpretation of the dream; but here it was to declare the dream its. If. Yet if they could foretell the future, could they not much more easily tell what had happened? They professed to know what was coming; they could - so Nebuchadnezzar might argue - readily enough reason back from the future they knew to the sign of the future, the dream which had been given to him. <span class="accented">So they came and stood before the king.</span> We can imagine the long ranks of the principal <span class="accented">classes</span> of Chaldean <span class="accented">soothsayers</span> in Babylon hastening into the royal presence. All the soothsayers, we see, were not summoned, for Daniel and his friends were not, and they were not singular, else the writer would have given some reason for this omission. The writer assumes that his readers know so much about the habits of Bah;Ionian wise men and their schools, as to be aware that certain individuals might nominally be summoned to the court; and yet it might be some time before they were summoned on any critical occasion. The absence of the four Hebrews might be explained in two ways: either only the Chaldean magicians were in this case summoned, and, as Daniel and his friends were not Chaldeans, they were omitted; or they were not summoned he-cause their training was not yet complete. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
