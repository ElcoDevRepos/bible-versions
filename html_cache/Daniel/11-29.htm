The concept of an "appointed time" is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, emphasizing God's timing in the unfolding of history.<p><b>he will invade the South again</b><br>The "he" refers to a king of the North, traditionally understood as a Seleucid ruler, likely Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The "South" refers to Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty. This historical context is crucial, as the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms were major Hellenistic powers following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. The repeated invasions highlight the ongoing conflict between these two regions.<p><b>but this time will not be like the first</b><br>This suggests a change in the outcome or nature of the invasion compared to previous encounters. Historically, Antiochus IV's earlier campaigns against Egypt were initially successful, but this subsequent attempt would not achieve the same results. This phrase may also imply a shift in strategy or divine intervention altering the course of events. The unpredictability of human plans in contrast to God's ultimate plan is a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a ruler from the Seleucid Empire, historically associated with Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who repeatedly attempted to expand his territory southward.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_south.htm">The South</a></b><br>Typically understood as Egypt, which was a frequent target of northern aggression during the Hellenistic period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/appointed_time.htm">Appointed Time</a></b><br>This phrase suggests a divinely ordained moment, indicating that the events are under God's sovereign control.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/invasion.htm">Invasion</a></b><br>Refers to the military campaign led by the King of the North against the South, highlighting the ongoing conflict between these two powers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/outcome.htm">Outcome</a></b><br>The result of this invasion, which is prophesied to be different from previous encounters, suggesting a change in fortune or divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_history.htm">God's Sovereignty Over History</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of historical events, including the rise and fall of nations.

Theodotion is also in practical agreement with the Massoretie text. The Peshitta is much shorter, and differs very much from the above, as well as from all the other versions, "And he shall do in the former and in the latter." There seems to have been something omitted, The Vulgate gives a different rendering of the last clause, "The last shall not be like the former." The reference is to the second expedition of Antiochus into Egypt. His two nephews, whose quarrels and rivalries he had hoped to utilize for his own pur<span class="accented">poses</span>, were now to appearance reconciled; they agreed to a joint occupation of the throne.
