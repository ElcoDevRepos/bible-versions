The term "administrators" indicates a level of authority and responsibility. This system reflects the hierarchical nature of ancient empires, where power was delegated to maintain control over vast territories. The number three may symbolize completeness or stability, a common theme in biblical numerology.<p><b>including Daniel</b><br>Daniel's inclusion as one of the administrators highlights his exceptional character and abilities. Despite being a Jewish exile, Daniel's wisdom and integrity earned him a prominent position in a foreign empire. This mirrors Joseph's rise to power in Egypt, showcasing God's providence and favor upon His faithful servants. Daniel's role also foreshadows Christ, who, though rejected by His own, is exalted by God.<p><b>to whom these satraps were accountable</b><br>The satraps, or provincial governors, were responsible for managing specific regions and reported directly to the administrators. This accountability structure was designed to prevent corruption and ensure loyalty to the king. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with responsibilities and must give an account of their actions, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>so that the king would not suffer loss</b><br>The primary purpose of this administrative system was to protect the king's interests, particularly in terms of revenue and political stability. The phrase underscores the importance of wise governance and the prevention of fraud or rebellion. In a broader biblical context, it illustrates the concept of safeguarding what is valuable, akin to the spiritual vigilance encouraged in the New Testament (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Jewish exile in Babylon, known for his wisdom and faithfulness to God.
