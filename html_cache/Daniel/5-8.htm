These individuals were considered experts in interpreting dreams and signs, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The gathering of all the king's wise men underscores the gravity of the situation and the king's desperation for answers. Historically, Babylon was known for its scholarly pursuits, particularly in astrology and divination, which were integral to their religious and cultural practices.<p><b>but they could not read the inscription</b><br>The inability of the wise men to read the inscription suggests that the writing was in a form or language unknown to them. This highlights the limitations of human wisdom and understanding when confronted with divine mysteries. The inscription was likely in Aramaic or a cryptic form of it, which was not uncommon for divine messages. This moment foreshadows the need for divine revelation, which Daniel, a man of God, would later provide.<p><b>or interpret it for him</b><br>The failure to interpret the writing emphasizes the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs. It also sets the stage for Daniel's entrance, who, through God's wisdom, would reveal the meaning. This inability to interpret the message parallels other biblical instances where human wisdom falls short, such as Pharaoh's dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, which only Joseph could interpret.

History repeats: human intellect is powerless before divine revelation.<p>&#8226; Spiritual truths remain veiled to the natural mind (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).

The verse sets the contrast: the best minds of Babylon are baffled, but the Lord is about to speak clearly through Daniel. In every age, God ensures that His message cannot be grasped by intellect alone; it must be received through humble dependence on Him, who alone &#8220;gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Then</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> after the king had addressed the wise men whom he had summoned. But why could not they read an inscription which Daniel deciphered at first sight? It has been conjectured (1) that the character was old Semitic, or one which the wise men did not know; (2) that the language of the inscription was unknown to them; (3) that the words were written in vertical columns, and the wise men endeavoured to read them horizontally. The only true explanation is to be found in the supernatural character of the inscription, and in the inspiration of Daniel. In this way God asserts Himself against the false wisdom of the heathens.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof</span>. As we have already said, the Septuagint here repeats the list of wise men. and omits "the Chaldeans." If the word "Chaldean" had been in the text originally, the fact that astrologers were frequently called Chaldeans would render it unlikely that the word should be omitted. Whereas from this very ground it was a word specially apt to be added on the margin, and once on the margin it would easily drop into the text. Even in the case of the Massoretic text, there seems to be a repetition here. It is certainly more obvious in the Septuagint text. The verse according to the Septuagint is, "And there entered in the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the astrologers, and were not able to announce the interpretation of the writing." Theodotion agrees here with the received text; the Peshitta omits "all." The only way in which we can escape the idea of this being a repetition is by holding that the word "all" is emphatic. The omission of the word "all" from the Peshitta is against this. It is to be observed that in the Septuagint there is no reference to "reading the writing;" it is only to announce the interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3606.htm">Strong's 3606: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wise men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ak&#183;k&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2445.htm">Strong's 2445: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise, a Magian</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came in,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1469;&#1464;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;l&#183;l&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5954.htm">Strong's 5954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To enter, to introduce</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but they could</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;l&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3546.htm">Strong's 3546: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be able</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
