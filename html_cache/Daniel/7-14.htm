In the context of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, this is a vision of the "Son of Man" receiving authority from the "Ancient of Days," symbolizing God. The terms "dominion," "glory," and "kingship" suggest a comprehensive rule, reflecting the divine authority and majesty. This echoes the messianic prophecies found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, where the government is upon the shoulders of the prophesied child, and in <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6-8</a>, where God sets His King on Zion and grants Him the nations as an inheritance.<p><b>that the people of every nation and language should serve Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of the Messiah's reign, transcending ethnic, cultural, and linguistic barriers. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The vision anticipates the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. It also aligns with <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne, serving God.<p><b>His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away</b><br>The everlasting nature of this dominion contrasts with the temporary and often oppressive reigns of earthly kingdoms, as depicted earlier in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> with the four beasts representing successive empires. This eternal dominion is a key theme in biblical prophecy, highlighting the ultimate victory and unending reign of the Messiah. It resonates with the promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God assures David that his throne will be established forever, pointing to the eternal reign of Christ.<p><b>and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed</b><br>This phrase underscores the indestructible nature of the Messiah's kingdom, offering hope and assurance to believers. In the historical context of Daniel, this would have been particularly comforting to the Jewish people under foreign domination. The indestructibility of this kingdom is further affirmed in <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>, which speaks of receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken. It also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where God's kingdom is described as one that will crush all other kingdoms and stand forever.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancient_of_days.htm">The Ancient of Days</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His eternal nature and sovereign authority.

The "Son of man" is therefore here spoken of as God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be</span> <span class="cmt_word">destroyed.</span> The versions differ only slightly and verbally from this. The personal element is here made prominent. Compare with this <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." The Messianic kingdom, and with it the Messiah, was to be everlasting. The resemblance is great, as might be expected, between this statement and that in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, "A kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the kingdom shall not be left to other people." It is to be noted that even his dominion is bestowed upon him. The Ancient of days, whose sentence has deprived the other dynasties of theft empire, bestows boundless empire on the Messiah (Comp. <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>. and 72.). Jeremiah's account of the state of matters on the return from the Captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>)is compared to this by Hitzig; but there it is not a <span class="accented">king</span> who is to come near before God, it is simply "governor" (<span class="accented">mashal</span>). In Jeremiah we have to do with a subject-people living in the fear of the Lord, but under the yoke of a foreign power. <span class="accented">Ecursus on</span> "<span class="accented">The Son</span> <span class="accented">of Man."</span> The title given here to the Messiah for the first time, appears prominently in the Book of Enoch, and becomes consecrated to us in the lips of our Lord, as the favourite title by which he designated himself as the Messiah. The phrase, "son of man," <span class="accented">ben-adam</span>, is used of man as contrasted with God: <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, "God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent;" of man as weak: <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, "Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as the grass?" (so <a href="/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). Again, it is used simply as equivalent to "man:" <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>, "No man shall abide there, neither shall son of man dwell in it" (see also <a href="/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>). The contrast, so far as there is a contrast, is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. In the Psalms we have <span class="accented">benee</span> <span class="accented">adam</span> and <span class="accented">benee ish</span> contrasted: <a href="/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>, "Surely men of low degree (<span class="accented">benee adam</span>) are vanity, and men of high degree (<span class="accented">benee ish</span>) are a lie." This distinction does not apply to Aramaic, in which <span class="accented">enush is</span> the only generally used word for "man." In the prophecies of Ezekiel the phrase becomes determinative of the prophet. The question is complicated, however, by the fact that in Eastern Aramaic <span class="accented">barnesh</span>, a contraction for <span class="accented">bar-enasho</span>, is used very generally for "men," as <span class="accented">col-bar-nesh</span>, "<span class="accented">everybody."</span> It also occurs in this sense in Targumic, though more rarely, as <a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>. The title here, then, simply declares that one, having the appearance of a man, was seen coming in the clouds of heaven. The phrase in the Peshitta for "the Son of man" is <span class="accented">batch d'nosh.</span> It is implied that this mysterious Being had the form of a man, but further, it is implied that he was other than man. In the Book of Enoch the phrase has ceased to be descriptive merely, and has become an appellation. Thus Enoch 46.: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> And there I saw one who had a head of days, and his head was white like wool, and with him was another being, whose countenance had the appearance of a man, and his face was full of graciousness like one of the holy angels. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me all the hidden things concerning that Son of man, who he was, and why he went with the Head of days. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> And he answered and said unto me, This is the Son of man, who hath righteousness, with whom dwelleth righteousness, and who reveals all the treasures of that which is hidden, because the Lord of spirits hath chosen him, and his lot before the Lord of spirits hath surpassed everything in uprightness for ever. This is clearly borrowed from the chapter before us. Elsewhere we have endeavoured to fix the date of this part of the Book of Enoch, as <span class="date">B.C. 210</span>. Of course, in this view the Maccabean origin of Daniel is definitely set aside. If, however, we take the date assigned to this part by Mr. Charles, then we have a choice between approximately <span class="date">B.C. 90</span> and <span class="date">B.C. 70</span>. Even then the date seems too near the critical date of Daniel to explain the rapid development the idea has undergone. In Daniel the person "like a son of man" may be a personification of Israel, though not naturally so; here in Enoch we have to do with a super-angelic being. As to the question of the reference of the title, it has been doubted whether it is to be held as applying to the Messiah, the Messianic kingdom, or to the people of Israel. The last view is that of Hitzig and many other critics of his school. It practically involves a denial of the truth of the idea that the Jews ever had Messianic hopes. In the present case there is nothing to indicate any reference to Israel personified. While there might be some plausibility in arguing from each of the four beasts representing empires that this "Son of man" should represent an empire also; it must be observed that in all the other cases there is a peculiarity which marks off the animal as merely a symbol: the lion has wings; the bear has three ribs in its teeth; the leopard has four heads and four wings; and the last, unnamed, beast has ten heads and iron teeth. Further, this "Son of man" is brought to the Ancient of days, and does not merely appear as do the "beasts." He has thus many of the characteristics of a person. The other view, that the "Son of man" indicates the Messianic kingdom, thus comes into line with the view of Hitzig. The view that it is the Messiah who is meant by the "Son of man" was held practically by all interpreters, Jewish and Christian, until the middle of last century. If we look at the phenomenon of prophetism, we shall find ourselves open to another view of the matter. From <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a> we see that prophets did not necessarily <span class="accented">know</span> the meaning of their own prophecies. It might well be, then, that to Daniel the distinction between the Messianic King and the Messianic kingdom was not one clearly apprehended. We see in the prophecies of the second Isaiah that the "servant of the Lord" is first the holy people, then the prophetic order, and latterly a person. There probably was a similar uncertainty here. If we grant this indeffiniteness, the next question that rises is - What is the special aspect of the Messianic kingdom that is intended to be portrayed when this title is given to its King? If we are guided by what is incomparably the oldest interpretation, that of the second Book of Enoch, this title implies an incalculable dignity. When we come to our Lord's use of it in the Gospels, there is nothing to oppose this. Thus <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>, "And hath committed all judgment unto him, because he is the Son of man;" so <a href="/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>, "The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins." This is not contradicted by <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, "The foxes have holes,... but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." The emphasis of the statement lies in the contrast between the inexpressible dignity of the Person and the poverty of his earthly circumstances. It is because the ideas of superhuman dignity had been associated with the title that our Lord had, in foretelling his approaching crucifixion,. to bring the two facts into close connection, "The Son of man must be lifted up." So after Peter's confession, "The Son of man must suffer many things." We see that the multitude of the Jews understood the title to have this lofty meaning, for they demand (<a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>), "How sayest thou, The Sen of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?" The attempts to make it imply something humiliating by dwelling on the fact that not <span class="accented">adam</span> or <span class="accented">ish is</span> the word for "man," but '<span class="accented">enosh</span>, are beside the question, for these deductions apply to the Hebrew words, not to the Aramaic. And in Aramaic neither <span class="accented">ish</span> nor <span class="accented">adam</span> is in common use as equivalent for "man." It is as much beside the point as if one, knowing the difference between <span class="accented">man</span> and <span class="accented">mann</span> in German, should lay stress on the fact that in this phrase in English "man" has only one <span class="accented">n</span>. The connection of this surpassing dignity with humanity has probably deep roots in human nature. The late Professor Fuller saw reference here to the function occupied by Silik-mooloo-Khi as mediator between Hea and mankind, and to the further development of this in the Zoroastrian doctrine of a <span class="accented">sosiosh</span>, or redeemer. The fall investigation of this is beside our present purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
