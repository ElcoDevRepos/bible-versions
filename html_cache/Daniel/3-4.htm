The role of a herald was significant, as they were responsible for ensuring that the king's commands were communicated clearly and authoritatively. The loud proclamation indicates the importance and urgency of the message. This scene takes place in the Babylonian Empire, under King Nebuchadnezzar, who was known for his powerful and expansive rule. The use of a herald underscores the king's authority and the seriousness of the decree being announced.<p><b>&#8220;O people of every nation and language</b><br>Babylon was a vast empire that encompassed many different peoples and cultures. The phrase "every nation and language" highlights the diversity within the empire and the extent of Nebuchadnezzar's dominion. This multicultural aspect is significant, as it reflects the historical context of the Babylonian Empire, which was known for its policy of relocating conquered peoples. This phrase also foreshadows the universal nature of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God.<p><b>this is what you are commanded:</b><br>The command that follows is a direct order from King Nebuchadnezzar, emphasizing the absolute power he wielded over his subjects. In the context of <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, the command pertains to the worship of the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. This decree sets the stage for the test of faith faced by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who refuse to bow down to the image. Their defiance and subsequent deliverance from the fiery furnace serve as a powerful testament to God's sovereignty and protection over those who remain faithful to Him. This narrative also prefigures the ultimate allegiance required by believers to Christ, who is the true King and Lord over all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herald.htm">Herald</a></b><br>A messenger or announcer who delivers the king's command to the people.

The former is applied to Israel in <a href="/psalms/111-6.htm" title="He has showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.">Psalm 111:6</a>, where occurs the phrase, "people of Jehovah." The word "languages" is applied (<a href="/genesis/10-5.htm" title="By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.">Genesis 10:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-20.htm" title="These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.">Genesis 10:20</a>, &c.) to tribes as represented by their languages. Hence these three expressions denote all nations subject to the empire, of whatever description of language, government, or federation. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm" title="Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.">Daniel 3:29</a>, and <a href="/daniel/4-1.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And the herald proclaimed to the multitudes, To you it is announced, peoples and countries, nations and tongues, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, the pipe, the harp, the sackbut, and psaltery, of chorus, and of all kinds of music, that ye fall down and worship the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar set up." It is clear that the Septuagint translator rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> as "host," and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> as if it were <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>. The balanced cadence of the next clause seems more natural, if due to the Aramaic source than to the Greek translator. The musical instruments are also arranged in the same cadenced fashion, broken to some extent by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, but omits <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The Peshitta in the fourth verse agrees not only word for word, but we might almost say syllable for syllable, with the Massoretic text. In the fifth verse it omits <span class="accented">pesanterin</span>; instead of <span class="accented">sabka</span>, it has <span class="accented">kinora</span>, which is usually regarded as the Hebrew equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it has <span class="accented">tziphonia</span>, which suggests a different etymology. It is true Strack ('Neu Hebraische Sprache') points out that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> has a tendency to become <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> before syllables with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> sound or at the end of words, but this is neither of these; the syllable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> is the first, not the last, and there is no <span class="accented">d</span> or <span class="accented">t</span> sound in the word. Jerome is in strict verbal agreement with the Massoretic text. We shall have to devote a short excursus to the names of the musical instruments which occur here. In eagerness to find proofs of the late origin of the Book of Daniel - of its origin in the times of the Hellenic domination, <span class="accented">karoza</span> was derived from .<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, that etymology is universally abandoned now. <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">people</span>, <span class="accented">nations</span>, <span class="accented">and languages.</span> It ought rather to be <span class="accented">peoples.</span> Bishop Wordsworth remarks on the resemblance which this phrase bears to tsar used of the mystical Babylon in Revelation (Revelation 13:7; 17:15), and adds that she also "commands them to fall down and worship the image which she has set up." In regard to the following verse, the sculptures of Nineveh prove the prominence given to music in all important occasions, as the celebration of a triumph or the dedication of a temple. The names of the musical instruments are not so generally preserved. It was most likely when the rays of the morning sun smote the golden tip of the obelisk, that there came the burst of music which was to serve as a signal for all the multitudes to fall down and worship.
