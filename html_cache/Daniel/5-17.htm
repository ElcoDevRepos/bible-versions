Daniel, a Jewish exile, stands before the king with confidence, reflecting his faith and the wisdom given by God. This moment echoes earlier instances where Daniel interpreted dreams for Nebuchadnezzar, showcasing his consistent role as God's messenger.<p><b>&#8220;You may keep your gifts for yourself</b><br>Daniel's refusal of the king's gifts highlights his integrity and detachment from worldly wealth. This mirrors the biblical principle of serving God rather than seeking material gain, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>. Daniel's focus is on delivering God's message, not on personal enrichment.<p><b>and give your rewards to someone else.</b><br>By suggesting the rewards be given to others, Daniel emphasizes that his service is not for personal benefit. This attitude is reminiscent of the prophets who spoke God's truth without seeking personal advantage, aligning with the humility and selflessness seen in Jesus Christ.<p><b>Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king</b><br>Daniel's willingness to read the inscription demonstrates his obedience to God's calling, regardless of personal gain. This act of service is a testament to his faithfulness and parallels the role of prophets who delivered God's messages despite potential risks.<p><b>and interpret it for him.</b><br>The ability to interpret the inscription is a gift from God, underscoring Daniel's role as a divinely appointed interpreter of mysteries. This mirrors Joseph's interpretation of dreams in Genesis, where God provides insight to His chosen servants.

In this way he showed his determination to speak the truth without any respect to fee, gift, or reward.

O thou king, the most high God gave</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: and for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humblet thine heart, though thou knewest all this; but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, hays drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.</span> We have gathered these verses together, as they all relate to one matter and come under one con-detonation. Long ago yon Lengerke, and more recently Hitzig, have shown that such an insulting speech as Daniel addressed to Belshazzar would certainly be visited with punishment. The king had no guarantee that the promised interpretation of the writing on the wall would be true, especially when the interpreter had such an animus against him. Then the fact in the twenty-ninth verse, that Daniel received the gifts he had rejected, makes his conduct here all the more extraordinary. A writer of fiction, of even moderate skill, would not make the blunder here made. It could easily be made by a <span class="accented">falsarius</span> interpolating a speech he thought suitable to a Jewish prophet in the presence of a heathen king, who had dishonoured the sacred vessels by drinking wine in them himself, and his wives, and his concubines. It is to be noted that the princes are omitted from the enumeration here. In proof that our contention is correct, we find the mass of this entirely omitted from the Septuagint. There are signs of confusion, and coalescence of different readings in the text of the Septuagint, yet we have no hesitation in claiming that it represents a much earlier state of the text than we find in our Hebrew Bibles, "Then Daniel stood before the writing, and read, and thus answered the king: This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it was reckoned; it has been removed." The marginal reading which we find in the beginning of this chapter has, <span class="accented">Mane</span>, <span class="accented">Phares</span>, <span class="accented">Thekel.</span> The interpretation here follows a different succession, "And the hand which wrote stood" - a phrase that seems to be a mistaken rendering of the latter clause of the twenty-fourth verse as we find it in the Massoretic text. It seems difficult to imagine what Aramaic word has been translated <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. Paulus Tel-lensis has (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">q'math</span>), which may have been mistaken for <span class="accented">sheliach</span>, though it is not easy to see how. The clause is, at all events, misplaced. The following clause also is misplaced, and is a doublet of the first clause of the twenty-sixth verse. The twenty-third verse seems to be the nucleus of the speech ascribed to Daniel, "O king, thou madest a feast to thy friends, and thou drankest wine, and the vessels of the house of the living God were brought, and ye drank in them, thou and thy nobles, and praised all the idols made with the bands of men, and the living God ye did not bless, and thy breath is in his hand, and he gave thee thy kingdom, and thou didst not bless him, neither praise him." The wives and concubines are not mentioned here. There is no word of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar. Although from the disturbed state of the text in the immediate neighbourhood one is inclined to suspect the authenticity of this twenty-third verse, given in the LXX., yet there is nothing that contradicts the position created by the two early decrees of Nebuchadnezzar, which placed Jehovah the God of the Jews on a par with the great gods of Babylon to whom, though no worship was decreed, at all events no dishonour was to be done. Belshazzar is not so much blamed for praising the gods of wood and stone as for omitting to praise Jehovah. Belshazzar had dishonoured Jehovah, and therefore this ominous message had come forth. The first clause here seems the primitive text. What was more natural than that Daniel, coming into the presence of the king, should go and stand before the mysterious writing, and then, having read it himself, turn to the king and address him? The words of the Massoretic and of the text behind the Septuagint differ very considerably, but not so much but that the former may have grown out of the latter by expansion, and the insertion of paraphrastic additions. A peculiarity to be observed in the Massoretic text (ver. 17) is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehayvyan</span>), the third plural imperfect of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "to be." It is difficult to understand this form of the third person, save on the supposition that Daniel was written in a region where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> was the preformative. This preformative along with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> was used in Babylon so late as the period of the Babylonian Talmud. Theodotion and the Peshitta practically agree with the Massoretic text. Even when we omit all the insulting elements, we have Daniel's speech to Belshazzar as we find it in the Massoretic text; no reader can fail to notice the difference of Daniel's demeanour towards Belshazzar as narrated here, from that towards Nebuchadnezzar as narrated in the preceding chapter. When he learns the disaster that impends on the destroyer of his city and the conqueror of his nation, Daniel is astonied and silent, and bursts out from his silence, "The dream be upon thine enemies, and the interpretation thereof upon them that hate thee." He shows no sign of sorrow when he learns the fate impending on Belshazzar. We can understand this, if we regard Daniel's love for the splendid conqueror making him feel the blood of his murdered descendants, Evil-Merodach and Labasi-Marduk called for vengeance. So far as we can make out from external history, Belshazzar was a gallant young prince, who seemed to be able to maintain himself against Cyrus, while his father lived in retirement in Tema; but the judgment of God often falls on those who are not worse than their <span class="accented">predecessors</span>, only guilt has accumulated and ripened. Louis XVI. was not worse than, but really greatly superior to, his two immediate predecessors, yet on him, not on them, broke the vengeance of the French Revolution.
