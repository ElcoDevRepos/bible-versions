The restoration of his sanity signifies God's mercy and the fulfillment of the prophetic dream interpreted by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24-26</a>). This event underscores the biblical theme that God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and can humble the proud (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>my honor and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's honor and splendor being restored highlights the restoration of his royal dignity and authority. This reflects the biblical principle that God can restore what is lost when there is repentance and acknowledgment of His sovereignty (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>). The phrase "for the glory of my kingdom" indicates that his restoration was not just personal but also had implications for the stability and prosperity of Babylon, a key empire in biblical history.<p><b>My advisers and nobles sought me out</b><br>The return of Nebuchadnezzar's advisers and nobles signifies the re-establishment of his political power and the recognition of his authority by the court. This reflects the cultural importance of a king's council in ancient Near Eastern governance, where advisers played crucial roles in administration and decision-making (<a href="/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13-14</a>).<p><b>and I was restored to my throne</b><br>This restoration to the throne symbolizes the complete reversal of Nebuchadnezzar's downfall. It serves as a testament to God's ability to restore leaders to their positions when they acknowledge His supremacy. This mirrors the biblical narrative of other leaders who were restored after a period of trial, such as Job (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).<p><b>and surpassing greatness was added to me</b><br>The phrase "surpassing greatness" suggests that Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom became even more magnificent after his restoration. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where after His suffering and resurrection, Jesus was exalted to the highest place (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>). It also emphasizes the biblical truth that God can bless abundantly beyond what was previously experienced (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who experienced a humbling period of insanity as a result of his pride and was later restored by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar ruled, known for its grandeur and influence in the ancient world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/advisers_and_nobles.htm">Advisers and Nobles</a></b><br>The officials and leaders of Babylon who sought out Nebuchadnezzar after his restoration, indicating his regained authority and respect.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event where Nebuchadnezzar's sanity, honor, and splendor were returned, symbolizing God's sovereignty and mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/surpassing_greatness.htm">Surpassing Greatness</a></b><br>The additional honor and power given to Nebuchadnezzar after his restoration, highlighting God's ability to elevate those who humble themselves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's account is a powerful reminder of the dangers of pride and self-exaltation.

As we have already mentioned, the verse in the Septuagint text which agrees to this is very brief, "At that time my kingdom was set up and my glory restored to me." It may be a condensation of some independent scribe, carried to a greater degree in the one case than the other. Only from the genesis of our Daniel, as we have imagined it, it would seem more probable that the briefer forms are the more primitive, and the longer the result of the expansion to be credited to imaginative copyists. In proof of this it is to be observed that neither Theodotion nor the Peshitta exactly represents the Massoretic text. Theodotion renders, "At that time my intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) was restored to me, and came to the glory of my king-dora, and my beauty ("form," <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) returned to me, and my rulers and nobles sought me, and I was confirmed upon my kingdom, and more abundant greatness was added unto me." The Peshitta differs somewhat from this, "And when my intellect returned to me, my nobles and my great army sought me, and to my kingdom was I restored, and its great inheritance was increased to me." The differences between these two and the Massoretic text are slight compared with those that separate any one of those from the Septuagint; yet starting with the Septuagint text, the others are easily reached by slightly varying additions. The Peshitta certainly more clearly portrays what seems likely to have taken place - first, a revolution during the king's madness, and a counter-revolution to restore him when his reason returned. If, however, Nebuchadnezzar was simply confined in a portion of the palace, then his nobles, on the news of his restoration, might seek unto him. None of the texts presents quite a self-consistent representation. If we could perfectly unravel the confusion of the texts which form our present Septuagint text, we should probably find one of them nearly self-consistent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
