The act of drinking wine in this context symbolizes indulgence and excess, reflecting the moral and spiritual decay of the Babylonian empire. Wine is often associated with revelry and lack of self-control in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The banquet setting also highlights the contrast between the temporary pleasures of this world and the eternal truths of God.<p><b>they praised their gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone</b><br>This phrase underscores the idolatry prevalent in Babylon. The materials listed&#8212;gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone&#8212;were commonly used in the construction of idols in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These elements are also reminiscent of the statue in Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Daniel 2), symbolizing the transient nature of earthly kingdoms. The act of praising these gods reveals the spiritual blindness and rebellion against the one true God. This idolatry is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, which mock the futility of worshipping man-made objects. The contrast between the living God and lifeless idols is a recurring theme, emphasizing the need for true worship and allegiance to God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who hosted the feast where the events of <a href="/bsb/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a> took place.

The king deliberately used the sacred vessels taken from the Jerusalem temple (<a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Wine here pictures unrestrained pleasure that dulls spiritual awareness (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing&#8212;&#8220;As they drank&#8221;&#8212;shows how quickly sin escalates when the heart is untethered from reverence (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; God observed every sip. The coming handwriting on the wall (<a href="/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>) reminds us that judgment can break in at the height of human self-confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they praised their gods</b><p>The room echoed with songs of worship&#8212;but to the wrong audience.<p>&#8226; Praise, meant for the living God (<a href="/psalms/150-6.htm">Psalm 150:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>), was redirected to lifeless idols.<p>&#8226; The revelers knowingly celebrated their rebellion against the Lord of heaven (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; What we exalt reveals what rules us (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).

Stripped of that purpose, gold becomes a snare.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bronze and iron</b><p>Metals associated with strength and durability suggested security to the Babylonians.<p>&#8226; Daniel had already interpreted a statue of successive empires made of these same materials (<a href="/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32&#8211;35</a>). Belshazzar ignored the lesson that every kingdom falls before God&#8217;s eternal one.<p>&#8226; Trusting earthly power is futile: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Iron cannot protect a soul when the God who forged the universe calls time on a life (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wood and stone</b><p>By ending the list with the most common materials, Scripture highlights the absurdity of idolatry.<p>&#8226; Carved wood and hewn stone neither see nor speak (<a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later reasoned that the divine nature is far above &#8220;an image formed by man&#8217;s skill and imagination&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>).<p>&#8226; When hearts turn from the Creator, even the ordinary becomes a false sanctuary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/5-4.htm">Daniel 5:4</a> exposes the downward spiral of a heart intoxicated with pleasure and pride. While Belshazzar drank, he glorified lifeless idols fashioned from dazzling metals and common materials alike. The verse warns that any object, possession, or power that eclipses wholehearted worship of the living God is worthless and invites His judgment.
