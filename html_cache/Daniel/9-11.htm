Historically, Israel's disobedience is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the books of Judges, Kings, and Chronicles. The law referred to here is the Torah, which includes the commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The phrase "refusing to obey Your voice" underscores the willful nature of Israel's rebellion, echoing the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah. This disobedience is not just a failure to follow rules but a rejection of a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>so the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us,</b><br>The "oath and the curse" refer to the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>. These passages detail the consequences of obedience and disobedience to God's commandments. The historical context here is crucial, as the Babylonian exile is seen as the fulfillment of these curses. Archaeological evidence, such as the Babylonian Chronicles, corroborates the events of the exile. The phrase "poured out on us" suggests a complete and overwhelming judgment, aligning with the prophetic warnings given by Moses and later prophets.<p><b>because we have sinned against You.</b><br>This admission of sin is a key element of repentance, which is a central theme in the book of Daniel. The acknowledgment of sin is necessary for restoration and forgiveness, as seen in the prayers of repentance throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>. Theologically, this phrase underscores the concept of sin as a breach in the relationship with God, necessitating divine intervention for reconciliation. This also points forward to the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate solution to the problem of sin, fulfilling the law and offering redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, who is interceding for his people, Israel, acknowledging their collective sin and seeking God's mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which has turned away from His commandments, leading to the consequences outlined in the Law of Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/law_of_moses.htm">Law of Moses</a></b><br>The covenantal laws given to Israel, which include blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is just in His judgments and merciful to those who repent.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curse_and_sworn_judgments.htm">The Curse and Sworn Judgments</a></b><br>Consequences outlined in the Mosaic Law for disobedience, which have come upon Israel due to their sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal failing but a communal issue that affects the entire body of believers.

Instead of pointing fingers at only the kings or the priests, he says every Israelite has stepped over the clear boundary lines God drew at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a>). Paul echoes this truth for all humanity: &#8220;all have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), but Daniel is laser-focused on his own nation. By acknowledging universal guilt, he strips away any illusion that some hidden faithful minority could avert judgment. The covenant was national (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10&#8211;15</a>), so the rebellion&#8212;and its consequences&#8212;are national too.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And turned away</b><p>The phrase pictures a deliberate pivot. God&#8217;s people knew the right path yet chose another, just as Isaiah lamented, &#8220;We have turned, each one, to his own way&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). Turning away from God is never neutral; it involves turning toward idols, alliances, and self-reliance (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). In exile, Daniel can literally see the result: Jerusalem in ruins, the temple destroyed, families scattered. Their physical displacement mirrors their spiritual drift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Refusing to obey Your voice</b><p>Disobedience is not merely breaking a rule; it is snubbing a Person. God&#8217;s &#8220;voice&#8221; spoke through Moses (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1</a>), through prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25&#8211;26</a>), and through the written Law. Israel silenced that voice by selective hearing. Jesus later confronted the same heart attitude when He said, &#8220;Why do you call Me &#8216;Lord, Lord,&#8217; and do not do what I say?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). The issue is willful deafness, not lack of information.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us</b><p>God&#8217;s covenant contained blessings for obedience and curses for rebellion (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;46</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;68</a>). Exile was not a random tragedy; it was the exact penalty God had promised. Daniel sees Babylon&#8217;s chains as proof that God keeps His word&#8212;even the frightening parts. The &#8220;oath&#8221; underscores legal certainty; the &#8220;curse&#8221; underlines painful reality. Both are fulfilled, demonstrating God&#8217;s unwavering integrity (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because we have sinned against You</b><p>Daniel circles back to the core issue: personal and collective sin against a holy God (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). No excuses, no blame-shifting, only ownership. This honest confession sets the stage for the plea that follows in verses 15&#8211;19. It also models the gospel pattern: sin admitted leads to mercy sought (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>). Daniel&#8217;s prayer opens the door to God&#8217;s restoration timetable (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>), showing that repentance is never wasted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a> is a sweeping confession summarizing Israel&#8217;s history of rebellion, the certainty of covenant curses, and the personal responsibility that invites God&#8217;s mercy. It reminds us that disobedience is relational, not merely legal; that God&#8217;s warnings are as trustworthy as His promises; and that genuine repentance begins with wholehearted acknowledgment: &#8220;We have sinned against You.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The curse.</span>--The passages in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, to which Daniel refers, had already been noticed by Isaiah (Isaiah 1), as having received a partial fulfilment in his times. It remains for Daniel to realise the complete "pouring" out of the curse. It is poured out like a torrent of rain (see <a href="/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>); as the fire melts the silver (<a href="/context/ezekiel/22-20.htm" title="As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.">Ezekiel 22:20-22</a>), so does the curse cause the nation to melt away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy Law. even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</span> The versions do not present any points worthy of special consideration. The prayer is resumed during the greater part of this verse. The reference here is to <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, the probability being more in favour of the latter, from the reference to the "oath." The last clause is a lapse again into the narrative style. In the parallel passage in Baruch it is narrative throughout. This clause may easily have been a gloss added by a scribe and inserted in the text by a copyist.
