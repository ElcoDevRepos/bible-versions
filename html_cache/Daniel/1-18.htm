This period was intended to prepare them for service in the Babylonian court. The king, Nebuchadnezzar, had decreed this time frame, highlighting the structured and authoritative nature of the Babylonian empire. The training included learning the language and literature of the Chaldeans, which was essential for their roles as advisors. This reflects the broader theme of God's people living in exile and adapting to foreign cultures while maintaining their faith.<p><b>the chief official presented them</b><br>The chief official, Ashpenaz, was responsible for overseeing the young men selected for this program. His role was crucial in ensuring that they adhered to the king's requirements. This presentation signifies a formal evaluation of their progress and readiness to serve. It also underscores the hierarchical structure of the Babylonian administration, where officials were accountable to the king. The presentation can be seen as a test of faithfulness and integrity for Daniel and his friends, who had chosen to follow God's dietary laws despite the pressures to conform.<p><b>to Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, a powerful ruler known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian empire. His reign is well-documented in both biblical and extra-biblical sources, such as the Babylonian Chronicles. Nebuchadnezzar's interactions with Daniel and his friends throughout the book of Daniel illustrate the tension between earthly power and divine sovereignty. This moment of presentation is significant as it sets the stage for the favor and wisdom that God grants Daniel and his friends, which ultimately leads to their elevated status in the Babylonian court. This encounter foreshadows the future challenges and triumphs they will face, demonstrating God's providence and faithfulness to His people in exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>- A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his wisdom and faithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>- The king of Babylon who conquered Jerusalem and initiated the training of select young men from Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_official.htm">Chief Official (Ashpenaz)</a></b><br>- The Babylonian official responsible for overseeing the training and presentation of the young men to the king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>- The empire that conquered Judah and took many Israelites, including Daniel, into exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_training_period.htm">The Training Period</a></b><br>- A three-year period during which Daniel and his friends were educated in the language and literature of the Babylonians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Daniel and his friends remained faithful to God despite being in a foreign land.

Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these;">Daniel 2:28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now at the end of the clays that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> The Septuagint Version here is shorter and simpler: "After these days the king commanded to bring them in, and they were brought in by the prince of the eunuchs." The only difference is that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">haayleh</span>) is read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">asher</span>), and the <span class="accented">maqqeph</span> dropped. Theodotion is in close accordance with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is also simpler than the Massoretic text, though founded on it: "And after the completion of the days which the king had arranged, the chief of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar the king." Both the Massoretic and Peshitta texts represent the prince of the eunuchs bringing the youths before King Nebuchadnezzar when the time had elapsed, without any orders from the king himself. According to the Septuagint, it was the king himself that required them to be presented before him. It seems more like the active-minded king, that he should recall his purpose of examining these youths, and command them to be brought in, than that the prince of the eunuchs should bring them trooping in without warning into the royal presence. Such an examination, whether conducted by the king personally, or in his presence, or under his superintendence, would need to be prepared fur; something equivalent to examination papers, test questions, would have to be arranged, or the presentation before the king would be a farce. All this implies that Nebuchadnezzar himself arranged the time of the appearance of those youths before him. We can scarcely imagine the awe with which those young captives must have looked forward to standing before the terrible conqeueror who had swept the army of Egypt before him, and had overthrown all who ventured to oppose him, who had sent home hosts of captives to throng the slave-markets of Babylon. We are not told whether each separately was brought before Nebuchadnezzar, or whether the whole number of the cadets were presented at once. It is the earliest instance of promotion by competitive examination. The clear, sharp eye of the young conqueror was probably worth more than all the questions prepared. While certainly the words used seem to imply that the hostages were called merely to be examined, the occasion may have been the "dream" narrated in the next chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now at the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;miq&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l, Preposition-m &#124;
