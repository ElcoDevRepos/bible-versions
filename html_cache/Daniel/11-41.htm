This term highlights the land's significance as the Promised Land given to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Historically, Israel has been a focal point of conflict due to its strategic location at the crossroads of major ancient civilizations. The prophecy in <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> is often associated with the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Hellenistic king known for his persecution of the Jewish people and desecration of the Temple. This invasion can also be seen as a foreshadowing of future events, possibly relating to eschatological prophecies concerning the end times.<p><b>and many countries will fall</b><br>This phrase suggests a widespread conquest and domination by the invading force. Historically, this aligns with the expansionist policies of empires like the Seleucids under Antiochus IV. Theologically, it reflects the transient nature of earthly kingdoms in contrast to the eternal kingdom of God. The fall of many nations can also be seen as a precursor to the ultimate establishment of God's dominion, as prophesied in other parts of Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>But these will be delivered from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the leaders of the Ammonites</b><br>Edom, Moab, and Ammon were ancient nations located east of Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites. Their exemption from conquest in this prophecy is intriguing, as these regions were historically subjugated by various empires. This deliverance could symbolize God's sovereignty and the selective nature of His protection. In a broader prophetic context, it may indicate the preservation of certain groups for a specific purpose in God's plan. These nations, though often adversaries of Israel, are mentioned in eschatological prophecies, suggesting a future role in the unfolding of divine events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beautiful_land.htm">The Beautiful Land</a></b><br>This term traditionally refers to the land of Israel, often seen as a place of God's promise and blessing.

<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>).<p>Takeaway: Israel&#8217;s land will face invasion, yet its designation as &#8220;Beautiful&#8221; highlights both its present value to God and its future restoration (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and many countries will fall</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and many countries will fall.&#8221;

On the occasion of his hasty march against Egypt, while passing through Palestine, the king takes the shortest route, avoiding the three tribes which had been distinguished by their hostility towards the people of Israel. It is remarkable that these nations (two of which appear as figures of Antichrist, <a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?

It is also noteworthy that these three tribes are called nations, for after the return from the exile it appears that they ceased to have any distinct national existence. As tribes they had some considerable power, taking the part of Antiochus in the Maccabee wars.

(Comp. <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</span> The Septuagint rendering is slightly of the nature of a paraphrase, "And he shall pass into my land, and many (feminine) shall be offended, and these shall be saved from his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the head of the sons of Ammon." It is possible that the word <span class="accented">tzebee</span> was omitted, and the pronominal suffix attached to '<span class="accented">aretz.</span> Theodotion renders, "And he shall enter into the land of the Sabaeem, and many shall be made weak; but these shall be delivered out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and chief of the sons of Ammon." The transliteration here might suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, and a mistake of the former for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> is in the square letters not impossible; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> are, in the older scripts, very unlike. The Peshitta, while agreeing with the Massoretic generally, renders, "the glorious land," "the land of Israel" - an evident paraphrase. The Vulgate introduces <span class="accented">solae</span> before Edom and Moab, otherwise agreeing with the received text. The expedition of Antiochus reaches Palestine, on which the full force of the tempest is represented as being directed. The countries adjacent escape. Edom, Moab, and Ammon are mentioned, but Moab had by this time disappeared as a national name. It may have been inserted - as suggested by Professor Bevan - in consequence of the frequent conjunction of the three names, "Moab, Am-men, and Mount Seir." It is, however, singular that these nations should be named as "escaping," since they were the allies of Antiochus, or more properly, as they would be regarded by him as subjects, his instruments in the oppression of Israel. It may be that this version of the vision of Daniel has been less modified from the original than what has preceded. In the original document, Edom, Moab, and Ammon might have some symbolic reference. <span class="accented">The glorious land</span> can scarcely be other than Palestine. It is rendered by Ewald, "the land of the ornament" It might be rendered, "the land of the gazelle." Out of the thirty passages in which this word occurs in Scripture, fourteen times it must have this meaning, in some of the other cases it may have it. So far, then, as the name goes, it might apply to any country fitted for the habitation of the gazelle; but the mention of "Edom, Mesh, and Ammon" renders it nearly a necessity that the reference here be to Palestine. <span class="accented">Many countries shall be overthrown.</span> The verb used is <span class="accented">kashal</span>, which means, in the niphal, "to totter," "to fall," "to be weak." It is assumed by Hitzig and Fuller, as by the English versions, that "countries" is to be understood. Ewald, however, and many other commentators, following the older versions, would refer to men, and translate, "myriads shall fall." In the version from which Origen has supplemented the Septuagint it is rendered, "Many women or countries shall be offended (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)," the feminine rendering being due to the feminine termination <span class="accented">-oth</span> in <span class="accented">rabboth</span>, but the verb is masculine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will also invade</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
