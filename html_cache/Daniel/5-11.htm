The "spirit of the holy gods" suggests a divine or supernatural wisdom, which the Babylonians attributed to their pantheon of gods. This reflects the polytheistic beliefs of the Babylonian culture, which often interpreted extraordinary human abilities as divine endowments. Daniel's reputation for having such a spirit indicates his recognized role as a conduit of divine wisdom, aligning with the biblical theme of God empowering His servants.<p><b>In the days of your father he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods.</b><br>The reference to "your father" is to King Nebuchadnezzar, though Belshazzar was actually the son of Nabonidus. In ancient Near Eastern texts, "father" can mean predecessor or ancestor. Daniel's abilities were acknowledged during Nebuchadnezzar's reign, as seen in earlier chapters where Daniel interprets dreams and provides counsel. The comparison to the wisdom of the gods underscores the extraordinary nature of Daniel's gifts, which were seen as surpassing human capability, pointing to divine inspiration.<p><b>Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners.</b><br>Daniel's appointment as chief over these groups highlights his prominence in the Babylonian court. These roles were significant in Babylonian society, as they were believed to interpret the will of the gods. Daniel's leadership over them indicates his superior wisdom and the trust placed in him by Nebuchadnezzar. This also reflects the biblical theme of God elevating His faithful servants to positions of influence, as seen with Joseph in Egypt.<p><b>Your own father, the king,</b><br>The repetition of "your father" emphasizes the continuity of Daniel's reputation and the respect he commanded across different reigns. It also serves as a reminder to Belshazzar of the legacy and decisions of his predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar, who recognized and valued Daniel's God-given abilities. This sets the stage for the unfolding events in the chapter, where Daniel's wisdom is once again called upon to interpret the writing on the wall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Jewish exile in Babylon known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams and visions.
