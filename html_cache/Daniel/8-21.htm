In the context of Daniel's vision, this goat is contrasted with the ram, which symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire. Historically, Greece rose to power after the decline of the Medo-Persian Empire, aligning with the prophetic sequence of empires in Daniel's visions. The use of a goat is significant, as goats were common in the region and often associated with strength and agility, characteristics that describe the rapid expansion of the Greek Empire under its leadership.<p><b>and the large horn between his eyes is the first king</b><br>The large horn signifies the first king of the Greek Empire, historically recognized as Alexander the Great. Alexander's conquests were swift and extensive, fulfilling the prophecy of a powerful leader who would dominate the known world. His reign marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period, which had a profound impact on culture, language, and politics in the ancient world. The imagery of the horn is consistent with biblical symbolism, where horns often represent power and authority. Alexander's untimely death led to the division of his empire, a theme further explored in subsequent verses and chapters of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaggy_goat.htm">Shaggy Goat</a></b><br>Symbolizes the kingdom of Greece.

The animal&#8217;s speed and vigor highlight a real, future empire that would burst onto the world scene with stunning swiftness.<p>- Scripture interprets Scripture: verse 21 plainly identifies the goat. We take the text at face value&#8212;no allegory needed.<p>- Earlier prophetic images use distinct beasts to symbolize kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-6</a>); the pattern holds here, reinforcing God&#8217;s consistency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Represents the king of Greece</b><p>- The goat &#8220;represents the king of Greece&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>). Daniel received this in the sixth century BC, long before Greece became a global power, underscoring God&#8217;s foreknowledge (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>- The empire arises from the west (<a href="/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a>), matching Greece&#8217;s location relative to Persia and Babylon.<p>- History confirms the match: within a few short years (334-323 BC) Greece, under a single leader, crushed the Medo-Persian Empire exactly as verses 6-7 foretold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The large horn between his eyes</b><p>- In prophetic imagery, horns symbolize ruling authority (<a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>). The &#8220;large horn&#8221; stands out&#8212;one conspicuous ruler dominates the empire.<p>- Verse 5 depicts the goat with &#8220;a conspicuous horn between his eyes,&#8221; directing all its energy. That visual reinforces the idea of centralized, charismatic leadership.<p>- God&#8217;s Word emphasizes that earthly power, however impressive, is still subject to His sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is the first king</b><p>- The &#8220;first king&#8221; is historically fulfilled in Alexander the Great, Greece&#8217;s inaugural world monarch. Before him, Greek city-states had no empire-wide king; Alexander united them and launched eastward.<p>- <a href="/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a> adds, &#8220;The goat became very strong. But at the height of its power, its large horn was broken,&#8221; mirroring Alexander&#8217;s sudden death in 323 BC at age 32.<p>- After his demise, four horns replace the one (<a href="/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8, 22</a>), fulfilled when his generals divided the empire&#8212;a detail later verses elaborate and history validates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a> gives God&#8217;s own explanation of the vision: the shaggy goat = Greece; the large horn = its first great king, Alexander. The prophecy, recorded centuries in advance and fulfilled with pinpoint accuracy, displays the trustworthiness of Scripture and God&#8217;s absolute control over nations and history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rough goat is the King of Grecia; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king</span>. Again all the versions agree in omitting the word "rough," and in inserting "of the goats," as in the fifth verse. The authority of these is much too great to be resisted. The Massoretic reading is probably due to a confluence of readings, as the word translated "rough" also means "goats." The omission of the word "of the goats" is probably due to the inclusion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">sa'eer</span>). Here, as in the previous case, "king" stands for dynasty; and this is proved by the fact that there is implied a series of kings, of whom the great horn is the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The shaggy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
