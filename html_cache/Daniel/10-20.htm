The context is a vision Daniel receives during a time of mourning and fasting. The question emphasizes the importance of the message and the divine purpose behind the angel's visit. It reflects the biblical theme of divine revelation, where God communicates His plans and purposes to His prophets. This encounter is reminiscent of other angelic visitations in Scripture, such as those to Abraham, Mary, and Joseph, where the purpose of the visit is to deliver a significant message.<p><b>&#8220;I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia,&#8221;</b><br>The "prince of Persia" is understood to be a spiritual being, possibly a demonic force, that influences the Persian Empire. This reflects the biblical worldview of spiritual warfare, where earthly events are influenced by spiritual entities. The angel's need to "fight" suggests ongoing spiritual battles that affect the course of human history. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of struggles against spiritual forces. The mention of Persia ties into the historical context of the Jewish exile and the subsequent return under Persian rule, highlighting the interplay between divine sovereignty and human empires.<p><b>&#8220;and when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Greece will come.&#8221;</b><br>The "prince of Greece" refers to another spiritual entity associated with the Greek Empire, which historically succeeded the Persian Empire. This prophecy foreshadows the rise of Greece, particularly under Alexander the Great, and the subsequent Hellenistic influence on the Jewish people. The transition from Persia to Greece is a key element in the prophetic timeline of Daniel, aligning with the visions of the statue in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and the beasts in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. This phrase underscores the theme of God's sovereignty over the rise and fall of nations, as well as the spiritual dimensions behind geopolitical shifts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angelic_messenger.htm">The Angelic Messenger</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is an angelic being who has been sent to Daniel to deliver a message and provide insight into spiritual warfare.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving this vision and message.

The angel reminds Daniel of the divine purpose behind his visit, discloses immediate combat with the demonic power over Persia, and predicts the next conflict tied to Greece. Through it all, God remains in control, answering prayer, directing history, and deploying His angels to ensure His prophetic plan unfolds exactly as promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Then said he.</span>--The meaning of this verse is obscure. Apparently the person who is speaking refers back to what he had said (<a href="/context/daniel/10-12.htm" title="Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.">Daniel 10:12-14</a>); and from the question <span class= "ital">"</span>Knowest thou?" &c., we are to infer that Daniel was perfectly aware of the reasons which caused him to come, viz., "to make thee understand what shall befal thy people in the latter days." But before he proceeds to make this revelation, he prepares Daniel's mind for a portion of what is about to be revealed, by mentioning the spiritual powers which ruled over Greece. "I shall return to fight," referring to the Providence which watched over Israel during the Persian sovereignty; "but while I am gone forth" (the word being used in a military sense, as in <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm" title="As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.">Joshua 14:11</a>) "the prince of Javan will come," this word being also used in a hostile sense. The prophet is in this manner prepared for troublous times, which shall occur under the Macedonian supremacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of Grecia shall come.</span> The versions here are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. Theodetion, since he begins the speech of the angel with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>, may have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hayn</span>), "if," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>), the sign of interrogation. The Peshitta has, "to make war," instead of "fight," indicating a beginning of hostilities, not a continuance of them. <span class="accented">Then said he</span>, <span class="accented">Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee?</span> This question appears to be abruptly put, and to be put without awaiting an answer. Probably the meaning would be better brought out by rendering, somewhat colloquially, "You know, don't you? After I have revealed the future to you, I must return." In considering this whole subject, we must beware of taking everything literally. We may not deduce, because of the statement here, that angels are under the limitations of time and space, or that there is actual warfare. We must regard the matter as, to a large extent, figurative. <span class="accented">And now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia.</span> Every one who studies history in a philosophic spirit must see that the progress of the race, the evolution of that ultimate ideal state - the kingdom of heaven among men - is accomplished by successive steps, and over each step a nationality presides. This nationality represents the special moment of spiritual force necessary to secure the new step the race is required to take. While in the lower plane of history the nations themselves do these things; in the higher sphere it is their angels who are the actors. A nation has in it much of the characteristics of a living organism, and the angel of the nation is the life of that organism. <span class="accented">As</span> a finite being, the angel of any nation of necessity is imperfect; his knowledge of the Divine plan only limited. His instrument - the nation committed to his charge - is yet more imperfect. Let an imperfect being, however holy, have a piece of work to do, that work must assume, to him, an exaggerated importance; let him be associated as patron with sentient beings, and his affections must go forth to these beings in a special way. He will resist any attempt to limit in any way the function of that race which is specially his, and will be apt to interpret too widely this function, and be loth to recognize that its time is past, or this or that region is beyond its province. If we regard Gabriel as an angel - not of Egypt, as Hitzig, but of the kingdom of heaven, and by this the angel of prophecy (Ewald) - then he must exercise a watchful care over the actions of each nationality, and therefore of its angel, lest the ultimate purpose of God be in any way hindered. The angel of Persia might regard the national semi-independence allowed to the Jews as hindering the evolution of the idea exhibited by the Persian race. The Persian rule allowed races a good deal of licence if tribute were paid. It was required to specialize its treatment of the Jews; to convey them back from Babylon to Palestine; to protect them in Palestine; to assist them to set up a <span class="accented">quasi-independence</span>. All this was contrary to the negative character of the Persian rule, in contradiction to its spirit, and therefore opposed by its angel, who represented this spirit. Michael, the special angel of the Jews, naturally came to assist Gabriel. What a conflict between angelic spirits may mean, what may be the weapons of their warfare, we know not; we do know that, though not carnal, they are mighty. <span class="accented">And when I am gone forth.</span> To this phrase several meanings have been attached. Havernick, Maurer, and Ewald take it as meaning "going forth to war." Ewald renders, "I will return to contend against the Prince of Persia; so, while I am going forth, the Prince of Javan will come." In this connection it is very doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">yatza</span>) can mean "going forth to battle." Motion to the field of battle is indicated by "return." <span class="accented">Yatza</span> simply means to <span class="accented">go from</span> a given place; the purpose may be indicated by some other word. Another view is that of Hitzig, Hofmann, and Bertheau, "to go out," not to, but from "a conflict." This meaning is possible; it would certainly need some determinant to fix this meaning on it, but this may be supplied from the preceding clause. This view, though suiting admirably with the otherwise untenable supposition that the "prince" speaking with Daniel is the angel of Egypt, does not suit with the view that Gabriel, the "prince" talking with Daniel, is the angel of prophecy, and therefore of the ideal kingdom. Keil would take the first meaning of <span class="accented">yatza</span>, and would paraphrase thus, "Now shall I return to resume and continue the war with the Prince of Persia; but while I thus go forth to war - while I continue the conflict, the prince of Javan shall come, and then there shall be a new conflict." <span class="accented">Yatza</span> never does mean "to continue a conflict;" it means to begin either a war, a battle, or a campaign. A great deal of the difficulty is due to maintaining that angels are under the time-relation of human beings. The matter is clearer if we take it as meaning simply that when Gabriel went out from the presence of Daniel, the "Prince of Grecia" would come. <span class="accented">Lo</span>, <span class="accented">the Prince of Grecia shall come.</span> This does not refer to Alexander the Great, or the overthrow of the Persian Empire, still less to the Seleucids and their persecutions. Before his Babylonian reign, Cyrus encountered the Greeks, and roused their opposition. The angel, then, of the Greek nation began to stir up his people. Then came the Ionian revolt, and the successive invasions of Greece, which compelled the Persians to leave the "holy people" alone. The angelic Prince of Grecia appears first as an instrument of the angel of prophecy, to limit the power of Persia.
