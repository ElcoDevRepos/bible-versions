In biblical literature, trees often represent kingdoms or rulers (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). The growth of the tree signifies the expansion and strength of Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar's reign. This imagery is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern symbolism where trees were seen as cosmic structures connecting heaven and earth.<p><b>its top reached the sky,</b><br>The tree's top reaching the sky indicates the pride and ambition of Nebuchadnezzar. This imagery parallels the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>), where humanity sought to make a name for themselves by building a tower that reached the heavens. It reflects the king's desire for glory and dominance, which ultimately leads to his humbling by God. This phrase also suggests the divine oversight and eventual judgment that comes from God, who is above all.<p><b>and it was visible to the ends of the earth.</b><br>This suggests the extensive influence and renown of Babylon, which was known for its grandeur and power. Historically, Babylon was a center of culture, trade, and military might, making it known throughout the ancient world. The phrase also implies the universal impact of Nebuchadnezzar's rule, foreshadowing the prophetic nature of the dream, where the king's actions and God's response would be witnessed by all. This visibility can be seen as a type of Christ, whose kingdom is proclaimed to all nations (<a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who has a dream about a large tree, symbolizing his kingdom and its vast influence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel (Belteshazzar)</a></b><br>The prophet and interpreter of dreams who is called upon to explain Nebuchadnezzar's dream.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire over which Nebuchadnezzar reigns, known for its grandeur and power during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree.htm">The Tree</a></b><br>A symbol in Nebuchadnezzar's dream representing his kingdom's growth, strength, and influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine message to Nebuchadnezzar, revealing God's sovereignty and the temporary nature of earthly power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_earthly_kingdoms.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Earthly Kingdoms</a></b><br>The dream illustrates that all earthly power is under God's control and subject to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_human_power.htm">The Temporary Nature of Human Power</a></b><br>Like the tree, human kingdoms may grow large and strong, but they are ultimately temporary and can be brought low by God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pride_and_humility.htm">Pride and Humility</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's dream serves as a warning against pride, reminding us that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reach_of_influence.htm">The Reach of Influence</a></b><br>The tree's visibility to the ends of the earth symbolizes the far-reaching influence of a kingdom, prompting us to consider the impact of our own lives and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_revelation_and_interpretation.htm">Divine Revelation and Interpretation</a></b><br>The need for Daniel to interpret the dream highlights the importance of seeking divine wisdom and understanding in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_4_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 4:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_11_God_s_rule_over_rulers.htm">How does Daniel 4:11 illustrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and rulers?

Like the cedar in <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3&#8211;9</a>, Babylon&#8217;s reach was vast because God allowed it.<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6&#8211;7</a> warns, &#8220;Exaltation does not come from the east, west, or desert, but God is the Judge; He brings one down and lifts another up.&#8221; The very strength celebrated here carries the seed of a coming test: will the king acknowledge the Giver?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its top reached the sky</b><p>&#8226; The phrase recalls human ambitions that press upward toward the heavens&#8212;think of Babel&#8217;s tower in <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a> or the pride of the king of Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>.<p>&#8226; For Babylon, &#8220;reaching the sky&#8221; meant unrivaled global supremacy. Jeremiah told the nations, &#8220;I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Height in Scripture often signals both greatness and impending judgment if pride takes root (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3&#8211;4</a>). <a href="/bsb/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a> will soon show God bringing that towering pride low, proving again that &#8220;the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom He will&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was visible to the ends of the earth</b><p>&#8226; Ancient travelers knew Babylon&#8217;s fame; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a> notes how David&#8217;s reputation spread &#8220;through every land,&#8221; echoing the same idea of worldwide visibility.<p>&#8226; Visibility speaks of influence. Like the mustard seed that grows into a tree where &#8220;the birds of the air come and nest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31&#8211;32</a>), this empire provided security, trade, and culture for nations under its branches.<p>&#8226; Yet global platforms amplify accountability. <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a> reminds us, &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required.&#8221; The more people saw Babylon&#8217;s splendor, the more they would witness the king&#8217;s humiliation when he refused to glorify God (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a> paints a vivid, literal portrait of Babylon&#8217;s rise: a God-planted tree that became large and sturdy, stretched to the heavens, and dominated the horizon. Each stroke of the image underscores divine sovereignty&#8212;growth granted by God, height limited by God, influence judged by God. The verse calls every leader and nation to remember that the One who enlarges kingdoms also humbles them, urging us to give all glory to &#8220;the King of heaven, whose works are true and whose ways are just&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The tree grew.--</span>It appeared in the vision to grow gradually larger and larger. According to the LXX., "The sun and moon dwelled in it and gave light to the whole earth."<p><span class= "bld">The sight thereof--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the tree could be seen from the most distant parts of the known world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</span> This verse is transposed in the Septuagint with the following verse, and is rendered, "And its appearance (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) was great, and its top approached to the heavens, and its breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to 'branches') filled (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) to the clouds all things beneath the heaven and the sun and the moon were, and dwelt in it, and enlightened all the earth." The addition in the last clause is a singular and picturesque one to one standing beneath a spreading tree; sun and moon might pierce with their rays through some thin points in the foliage, but they would seem never to get beyond the widespread branches of the tree, and therefore it would be but a poetical mode of statement to say, "the sun and moon dwelt amid the branches." At the same time, it is not impossible that there was some astronomical legend of the sun and moon and the tree of life. If this proclamation was originally written in cuneiform, there might easily be some difficulty at times in deciphering and fixing in which of a dozen possible senses a given word must be taken. The variation is beyond the region of mere ordinary blundering in Aramaic. On the other hand, it seems too picturesque for the work of a commonplace interpolator. Theodotion in the main agrees with the Massoretic, but instead of "sight thereof," he has "breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) thereof," reading some such word as <span class="accented">path-ootheh</span> instead of <span class="accented">hazotheh.</span> The Peshitta is in close agreement with the received text. To those who, like the Babylonian, believed the earth to he a vast plain, it was not inconceivable that a tree should be so high as to be seen over the whole earth. It is a very suitable symbol of a great world-empire. At the same time, we must remember that the great variation in this verse in the Septuagint makes its authenticity somewhat doubtful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The tree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;l&#257;&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_363.htm">Strong's 363: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grew large</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7236.htm">Strong's 7236: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and strong;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1425;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;qip&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
