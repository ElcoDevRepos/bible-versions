His amazement is significant, as it indicates a divine intervention that defies natural expectations. In the context of the narrative, Nebuchadnezzar had ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be thrown into a fiery furnace for refusing to worship the golden image he had set up. The king's reaction suggests a miraculous event, as he witnesses something beyond human explanation. This moment foreshadows the power of God to deliver His faithful servants, a theme consistent throughout the Book of Daniel.<p><b>and asked his advisers,</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's consultation with his advisers highlights the hierarchical structure of the Babylonian court, where decisions and observations were often validated by a council of wise men or officials. This reflects the cultural and political practices of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where kings relied on a cadre of counselors for governance and decision-making. The king's need for confirmation from his advisers underscores the extraordinary nature of what he witnessed.<p><b>&#8220;Did we not throw three men,</b><br>The reference to "three men" specifically points to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were Jewish exiles in Babylon. Their steadfast faith in God and refusal to bow to the king's image is a testament to their commitment to the first commandment, which prohibits idolatry. This phrase also sets the stage for the miraculous event that follows, emphasizing the number of individuals initially cast into the furnace.<p><b>firmly bound,</b><br>The detail of the men being "firmly bound" underscores the severity of their punishment and the intent to ensure their demise. Binding them would have been a standard practice to prevent any escape or resistance. This detail accentuates the miraculous nature of their survival, as it would have been impossible for them to free themselves from their bonds under normal circumstances. The imagery of being bound also serves as a metaphor for the spiritual bondage from which God delivers His people.<p><b>into the fire?&#8221;</b><br>The fiery furnace is a symbol of trial and persecution. In the historical context, fire was often used as a means of execution, representing the ultimate test of faith. The furnace's intense heat, described earlier in the chapter, was meant to ensure a swift and certain death. This setting provides a backdrop for demonstrating God's power to save and protect His faithful, even in the most dire situations. The fire also serves as a type of the refining process believers undergo, purifying and strengthening their faith.<p><b>&#8220;Certainly, O king,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>The advisers' response confirms the king's recollection and sets the stage for the miraculous deliverance that follows. Their agreement underscores the reliability of the king's memory and the factual basis of the event. This affirmation by the advisers, who were likely witnesses to the execution, adds credibility to the narrative and highlights the extraordinary nature of the miracle. The consensus among the king's court further amplifies the impact of God's intervention, as it leaves no room for doubt or alternative explanations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who ordered the construction of a golden statue and commanded all to worship it.

They answered and said unto the king, True, O king</span>. The Greek versions suffer in this verse also from the interpolation of the song. The LXX. renders thus: "And it was when the king heard them singing praises, and stood and saw them living, then was Nebuchadnezzar the king astonished and rose up hastily and said to his friends, Did we not cast three men into the fire bound? and thev said to the king, Truly, O king." Theodotion does not seriously differ from this, "And Nebuchadnezzar heard them singing praises, and marvelled, and rose up in haste, and said to his lords, Did we not cast three men into the midst of the fire bound? and they answered, Truly, O king." The Peshitta rendering is, "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up trembling, and answered and said to his princes, Were there not three men which we cast into the midst of the furnace of fierce fire and bound? and they answered the king, It is true, O king." As will be seen, the Peshitta varies less from the Massoretic than do the Greek versions. The Vulgar does not merit remark. The action of the king is introduced abruptly in the Massoretic text. This abruptness was probably the occasion of the interpolations made at this point. It may be observed that the interpolations - not-withstanding the efforts of redactors to soften the transition - all add to the difficulty. Theodotion has them immediately walking and praising God. The Septuagint translator, though he omits the walking, implies the praising. We are to unclear-stand the circumstances as of the nature of an <span class="accented">auto-da-fe</span> which Nebuchadnezzar was gracing with his presence, much as Philip II. attended the burning of the heretics in Madrid. The refusal of worship to the god to whom he had erected the golden image was an act not only of heresy, but also of treason of the blackest kind. The word <span class="accented">haddabereen</span>, translated "councillors," is derived by some from the Persian <span class="accented">hamdaver</span> (Behrmann and V. Bohlen). Gesenius would derive it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, "to do," hence "leaders;" he explains the first syllable of the Hebrew article. The first interpretation is impossible, as is well shown by Bevan (<span class="accented">in loco</span>). The supposition of Gesenius is difficult to maintain, as it involves a passage from one language to another. Moses Stuart regards the noun as derived from the aphel, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> appearing instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. This is not without parallel examples, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span>. Fuller's parallel of <span class="accented">apalu</span> used along with <span class="accented">pal</span> for "son" in Assyrian, shows a habit of introducing initial syllables to help pronunciation. The Septuagint translator probably read <span class="accented">habereen</span>; hence the rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. In the uncertainty as to the meaning of the word. the reading of the LXX. may be regarded as at least a possible way out of the difficulty. Some further discoveries, either in Babylon or elsewhere, may enable us to decide. The presence along with the king, at this execution, of the high officials of the empire, was fitted to give it all the solemnity of an "act of faith," but at the same time, their presence gave a signal meaning to <span class="cmt_word">the</span> miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Suddenly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">jumped up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
