The act of praying and confessing indicates a deep personal relationship with God, acknowledging His sovereignty and the need for divine intervention. This reflects the Jewish practice of prayer and confession, especially during times of distress or national crisis. Daniel's prayer is set during the Babylonian exile, a period when the Israelites were seeking restoration and forgiveness. Confession is a key theme in the Old Testament, seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40-42</a>, where God promises to remember His covenant if His people confess their iniquity.<p><b>O, Lord, the great and awesome God</b><br>Daniel acknowledges God's majesty and power, using titles that emphasize His transcendence and authority. The terms "great" and "awesome" are often used in the Old Testament to describe God's mighty acts and His ability to inspire reverence and fear. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>, where God is described as "great and awesome," highlighting His role as a divine warrior and protector of Israel. The use of these titles sets the tone for a prayer of adoration and reverence.<p><b>who keeps His covenant of loving devotion</b><br>This phrase underscores God's faithfulness and steadfast love, known in Hebrew as "hesed." The covenant refers to the promises made to the patriarchs and the nation of Israel, which God remains committed to despite their unfaithfulness. This reflects the covenantal theology central to the Old Testament, where God's relationship with His people is based on promises and obligations. The idea of a covenant-keeping God is also seen in <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, reinforcing the theme of divine faithfulness.<p><b>to those who love Him and keep His commandments</b><br>This condition highlights the reciprocal nature of the covenant relationship. Love and obedience are central to the covenant, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength is commanded. Obedience to God's commandments is a demonstration of love and loyalty, and it is through this obedience that the blessings of the covenant are realized. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus states in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments," linking love and obedience as evidence of true discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, known for his unwavering faith and integrity.

Daniel&#8217;s first instinct in crisis is personal, direct prayer, showing that communion with God is the believer&#8217;s primary resource (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;LORD&#8221; (Yahweh) signals covenant relationship; Daniel approaches the same covenant-keeping God who answered in <a href="/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17-23</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;my God&#8221; is intimate: faith is never merely national or inherited; it is owned (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and confessed</b><p>&#8226; Prayer includes honest acknowledgment of sin; revival always begins here (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Confession aligns us with God&#8217;s verdict on sin instead of excusing it, as <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a> demonstrates.<p>&#8226; This sets the stage for mercy, just as <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a> testifies: &#8220;I acknowledged my sin to You&#8230; and You forgave the guilt of my sin&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O, Lord</b><p>&#8226; The simple cry &#8220;O&#8221; carries reverence and urgency, echoing <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a> where awareness of God&#8217;s holiness produces humble address.<p>&#8226; Recognizing God as &#8220;Lord&#8221; means surrendering to His authority before presenting any petition (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the great and awesome God</b><p>&#8226; Daniel praises before petitioning, mirroring <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>: &#8220;How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Awesome&#8221; evokes holy fear, not dread, affirming God&#8217;s transcendent power (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Praising God&#8217;s greatness lifts faith above circumstances, as <a href="/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a> states, &#8220;You are awesome, O God&#8230;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who keeps His covenant of loving devotion</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s steadfast love is covenantal, not fickle; it is anchored in His character (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The history of Israel proves His faithful love even in discipline (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; By recalling the covenant, Daniel appeals to promises God is bound to honor, much like Moses in <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those who love Him and keep His commandments</b><p>&#8226; Covenant blessings are relational, received by those who respond in love-fueled obedience (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Love and obedience are inseparable; Jesus restates the pattern: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience is not legalism but grateful allegiance; <a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a> assures, &#8220;His commandments are not burdensome.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a> models prayer that begins with worshipful, confession-filled approach to the covenant-keeping God. Daniel reminds us that God&#8217;s greatness inspires confidence, His covenant love guarantees faithfulness, and His promises flow to those who love and obey Him. Such prayer aligns the heart with God&#8217;s character, preparing us to receive His gracious answers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The covenant.--</span>See <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and maid, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments.</span> The versions do not call for remark. The first clause is somewhat of a repetition of the end of the previous verse, and may thus be the indication of there having been two recensions; at the same time, the Oriental style allows greater repetition and redundancy than in Western countries would be permitted. There is a reference here to <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, from which the latter clause is quoted <span class="accented">verbatim.</span> It is also quoted with equal exactness in <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>. The chapter in Deuteronomy exhibits God's love for Israel, and hence, as that love is his plea, Daniel appeals to it.
