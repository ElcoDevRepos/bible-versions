His reign follows the fall of Babylon to the Medo-Persian Empire. This decree comes after Daniel's miraculous deliverance from the lions' den, showcasing God's power and faithfulness. Darius's actions reflect the influence Daniel had on him, as well as the recognition of God's sovereignty.<p><b>to the people of every nation and language throughout the land:</b><br>The Medo-Persian Empire was vast, encompassing many nations and languages. This phrase highlights the extensive reach of Darius's decree, emphasizing the universality of the message. It mirrors the inclusivity seen in the New Testament, where the Gospel is preached to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The decree's wide distribution underscores the importance of the event and the acknowledgment of God's power across diverse cultures.<p><b>&#8220;May your prosperity abound.</b><br>This greeting reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of wishing well-being and prosperity. It indicates a desire for peace and stability within the empire. Theologically, it can be seen as a precursor to the peace and prosperity promised in the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). The phrase also suggests a recognition that true prosperity comes from aligning with God's will, as demonstrated by Daniel's faithfulness and God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_darius.htm">King Darius</a></b><br>The ruler of the Medo-Persian Empire who issued the decree after witnessing Daniel's deliverance from the lions' den.

I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> This decree has a resemblance to the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar. In the Septuagint there is less magniloquence, though the divergence is too great to be the result merely of difference of reading, "<span class="accented">Then</span> Darius wrote to all nations and tongues and countries dwelling in all his land, saying, Let all men who are in my kingdom stand and worship, and serve the God of Daniel, for he alone abideth, and liveth to generations of generations for ever. I Darius will worship and serve him all my days, for none of the idols that are made with hands are able to deliver as the God of Daniel did Daniel." It is to be observed that it is only to the inhabitants of his own land that Darius writes, and further, it is "all men in his kingdom" he commands, not "every dominion in his kingdom." There is no notice taken of the kingdom of God; it is God himself who liveth and abideth for ever. The last verse, again, in the Septuagint, in which Darius professes his faith in Jehovah, is evidently spurious. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. Removing the exaggerations from it, the decree of Darius does not mean any more than we found in the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar; it is simply a warning against showing any disrespect to a Deity with such formidable powers as Jehovah. It may be regarded as connected with the dualistic view of the universe maintained by Zoroastrianism, that deliverance from lions is spoken of with such awe. The lion was one of the beasts specially representative of the evil principle, as we see in Persepolis. There was thus evidence given that the God of the Jews was supreme over the powers of evil; therefore, without forbidding any subject of Babylonia from worshipping his own ancestral divinity. Darius yet commanded him, in so doing, to watch his conduct, so that nothing disrespectful to the powerful God of the Hebrews should be done by him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
