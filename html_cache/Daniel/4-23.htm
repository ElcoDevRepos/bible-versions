The term "holy one" emphasizes their divine nature and purity. This vision given to King Nebuchadnezzar highlights the intervention of the divine in human governance, a theme consistent with the biblical narrative that God is sovereign over earthly kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). The descent from heaven signifies a message of divine authority and judgment.<p><b>and saying: &#8216;Cut down the tree and destroy it,</b><br>The tree symbolizes King Nebuchadnezzar and his vast empire, as previously interpreted by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20-22</a>). Trees often represent rulers or nations in biblical literature (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-14</a>). The command to cut down the tree signifies God's judgment against Nebuchadnezzar's pride and self-sufficiency, a recurring theme in Scripture where God opposes the proud (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>but leave the stump with its roots in the ground,</b><br>The preservation of the stump and roots indicates hope and the possibility of restoration. In biblical symbolism, roots often represent the foundation or remnant that can lead to renewal (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). This suggests that Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom will not be utterly destroyed but will have the potential for revival after a period of judgment.<p><b>with a band of iron and bronze around it,</b><br>The band of iron and bronze may symbolize protection and restraint. Iron and bronze are strong metals, indicating that the kingdom will be preserved but under divine control and limitation. This imagery reflects God's sovereignty in setting boundaries for human power and pride (<a href="/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>).<p><b>in the tender grass of the field.</b><br>The phrase "tender grass of the field" suggests humility and vulnerability. It contrasts with the former grandeur of the tree, emphasizing Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience. Grass is often used in Scripture to symbolize the transient nature of human life and glory (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>).<p><b>Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,</b><br>Being drenched with dew signifies exposure to the elements and a loss of royal comfort and protection. Dew in the Bible can symbolize blessing and sustenance (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>), but here it represents the king's humbling and his return to a natural, dependent state, akin to the beasts of the field.<p><b>and graze with the beasts of the field</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete loss of human dignity and status, as Nebuchadnezzar is reduced to living like an animal. It reflects the biblical theme of God humbling those who exalt themselves (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>). The imagery of grazing with beasts underscores the king's temporary insanity and separation from human society.<p><b>till seven times pass him by.&#8217;</b><br>The "seven times" likely refers to a period of seven years, a number often associated with completeness or divine perfection in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This period represents the full measure of God's judgment and the time necessary for Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge God's sovereignty. The use of "times" rather than specific years allows for a symbolic interpretation, emphasizing the completeness of the humbling process.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who receives the dream and its interpretation.

The term "watcher" (Aramaic: 'ir) suggests vigilance and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tree.htm">Tree</a></b><br>Symbolizes Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom and his personal greatness.

An angelic &#8220;watcher&#8221; makes clear that God monitors rulers, humbles the arrogant, and restores the repentant. The iron-bronze band, the dew-drenched nights, grazing with beasts, and the fixed span of &#8220;seven times&#8221; all combine to show that divine discipline is precise, purposeful, and ultimately redemptive. The passage calls every heart to bow before the Most High, recognizing that authority, sanity, and life itself are gifts sustained only by His grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Destroy it.</span>--Observe how, in this verse, these words stand for the whole of the latter part of <a href="/daniel/4-14.htm" title="He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:">Daniel 4:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him</span>. This in the beginning agrees with the text behind the Septuagint Version of ver. 14 (7 LXX., 11 Massoretic). In that verse, instead of the elaborate process of cutting off branches and shaking off leaves, the Septuagint had simply, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>. This confirms us in our preference of the Septuagint there. In the present instance, the Septuagint is briefer than the Massoretic text; it varies in some points, which may indicate the hand of a redactor, "And the vision which thou sawest, that an angel was sent in strength, and commanded to root the tree up and to cut it down, the judgment of God shall come upon thee." Here, again, there is nothing of "the watcher and the holy one," nothing of the belt of "iron and brass," nor of the "tree having its portion with the beasts of the field," nor that it was to be "wet with the dew of heaven." Some of these features are mentioned in the account of the vision, but are not repeated now. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta carries the repetition yet further, and inserts, "And his heart shall be changed from the heart of 't man, and the heart of a beast shall be given him." In this the process already begun in the text of the Massoretes is carried a little further. The Vulgate agrees with the received text. Daniel rapidly notifies the principal features in the king's dream, before he proceeds to explain it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
