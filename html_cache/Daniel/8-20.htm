In biblical symbolism, animals often represent kingdoms or empires. The ram is a fitting symbol for the Medo-Persian Empire, known for its power and conquests. The two horns signify the dual nature of the empire, composed of the Medes and the Persians. Historically, the ram was a symbol associated with Persia, and Persian kings wore a ram's head as a crown during battles.<p><b>represents the kings of Media and Persia</b><br>The Medo-Persian Empire was a significant power in the ancient Near East, succeeding the Babylonian Empire. The "kings" here refer to the rulers of this dual kingdom, with Cyrus the Great being the most notable, as he united the Medes and Persians. This empire is crucial in biblical history, as it allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28 and 45</a>:1. The Medo-Persian Empire is also depicted in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> as the silver chest and arms of the statue, indicating its position in the succession of world empires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two-horned_ram.htm">Two-horned Ram</a></b><br>Symbolic representation in Daniel's vision, representing the kings of Media and Persia.

The animal imagery is consistent with other prophetic scenes where beasts picture earthly powers (cf. <a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>).<p>- Two horns signal two distinct yet united powers within one empire. Horns in Scripture regularly symbolize strength and royal authority (see <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>).<p>- The vision&#8217;s concreteness reminds us that God does not speak in vague generalities; He anchors prophecy in specific, verifiable history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you saw</b><p>- This phrase roots the interpretation in Daniel&#8217;s firsthand experience. The prophet is not passing along rumor or conjecture but divine revelation he personally witnessed (<a href="/daniel/8-1.htm">Daniel 8:1-2</a>).<p>- Scripture stresses Daniel &#8220;kept the vision in his heart&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>), underscoring the reliability of the account.<p>- By recording what he saw, Daniel provides the church with an exact picture to compare with subsequent historical fulfillment (cf. <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>represents</b><p>- Gabriel, the angelic messenger, explicitly states that the ram symbolizes something literal (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16-19</a>). We are not left to speculation; heaven supplies the key.<p>- This confirms a foundational principle: when Scripture interprets its own symbols, believers accept that explanation without alteration (cf. <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>).<p>- The word &#8220;represents&#8221; bridges the vision with real-world kingdoms, assuring us prophecy touches concrete events, not merely spiritual abstractions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the kings of Media and Persia</b><p>- Gabriel identifies the two horns as &#8220;the kings of Media and Persia,&#8221; a dual monarchy that rose after Babylon&#8217;s fall (see <a href="/daniel/5-28.htm">Daniel 5:28</a>; 6:28).<p>- History records Cyrus the Great uniting the Medes and Persians, matching the picture of a single ram with two distinct horns yet one body.<p>- Isaiah foretold Persia&#8217;s ascendancy long before Cyrus was born (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-5</a>), and Jeremiah spoke of the Medes overthrowing Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>). Daniel&#8217;s vision dovetails perfectly with those earlier prophecies.<p>- The ram&#8217;s westward, northward, and southward charge (<a href="/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>) mirrors Persia&#8217;s rapid expansion under Cyrus and his successors, confirming the literal accuracy of the text.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a> delivers God&#8217;s own interpretation of Daniel&#8217;s vision: the two-horned ram is the unified empire of Media and Persia. Each element&#8212;ram, two horns, unstoppable advance&#8212;matches historical reality, demonstrating the precision of biblical prophecy and reminding believers that the Lord of history guides kingdoms for His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20-22) See Notes on <a href="/context/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</span> All the versions - the Septuagint, Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate - have read, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, as we find in the Massoretic text, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> The ancient construct case in Hebrew was formed by adding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> to the root. Possibly this may be a survival of that usage. In this case the change is due to scribal blunder. When we turn to <a href="/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> and Jeremiah 51:11, 58, we have the same phrases used as here: this is probably the origin of the blunder. For any one to ground an argument, as does Professor Bevan, on this, and maintain that it proves the writer to have held that there were two separate empires - one of Media, and the other of Persia - is absurd. When the true reading is adopted, this passage proves the very reverse of that for which Professor Bevan contends. The reasoning of Kliefoth, that the distinction between plural and singular points to the fact that, while several kings reigned ever the Persian Empire, only one ruled over the Greek, is very ingenious, but, unfortunately, it has no foundation in fact. "King," it may be observed, stands for dynasty, only that in the crisis of history, when the two powers encountered, each was ruled and represented by one king - Persia by Darius Codomannus, and Greece by Alexander. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The two-horned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;n&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7161.htm">Strong's 7161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A horn, a flask, cornet, an elephant's tooth, a corner, a peak, a ray, power</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_352.htm">Strong's 352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, strong, a chief, a ram, a pilaster, an oak, strong tree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">represents the kings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#7733;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Media</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7695;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Media -- a son of Japheth, also his descendants and their land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Persia.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1505;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;r&#257;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6539.htm">Strong's 6539: </a> </span><span class="str2">Persia -- a country in west Asia which conquered Babylon</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 8:20 The ram which you saw that had (Dan.
