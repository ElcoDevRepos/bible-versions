The name "Daniel" means "God is my judge" in Hebrew, reflecting his Jewish heritage and faith. "Belteshazzar" was the Babylonian name given to him, likely meaning "Bel, protect his life," associating him with the Babylonian god Bel. This dual naming signifies the cultural assimilation and identity challenges faced by exiles. It also underscores the tension between the pagan world and the faith of the Israelites, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>&#8220;Are you able to tell me what I saw in the dream, as well as its interpretation?&#8221;</b><br>This question from King Nebuchadnezzar reflects the Babylonian belief in the power of dreams as divine messages. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, dreams were often seen as omens or communications from the gods, requiring skilled interpreters. The king's demand for both the dream and its interpretation was unprecedented, highlighting his desperation and the failure of his own wise men. This sets the stage for Daniel to demonstrate the superiority of the God of Israel over Babylonian deities. The ability to reveal and interpret the dream points to divine revelation, a theme that echoes throughout scripture, where God reveals His will and future events to His prophets. This moment foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God, interpreting and fulfilling the divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew captive in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams, also called Belteshazzar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and his friends were taken captive, known for its grandeur and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dream.htm">Dream</a></b><br>A mysterious vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, which he demanded to be both recounted and interpreted by his wise men.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_babylon.htm">Wise Men of Babylon</a></b><br>The magicians, enchanters, and astrologers who were unable to fulfill the king's request, highlighting Daniel's unique God-given ability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God reveals mysteries to whom He chooses, demonstrating His control over human affairs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Daniel's faithfulness in a foreign land serves as a model for maintaining integrity and reliance on God despite challenging circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_community.htm">The Power of Prayer and Community</a></b><br>Daniel sought God's wisdom through prayer and the support of his friends, highlighting the importance of communal prayer and support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_to_stand_for_truth.htm">Courage to Stand for Truth</a></b><br>Daniel's willingness to approach the king with confidence in God's revelation encourages believers to stand boldly for truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_of_wisdom.htm">God's Provision of Wisdom</a></b><br>Just as God provided Daniel with the wisdom to interpret the dream, He provides believers with wisdom for life's challenges when they seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_26_God_s_sovereignty_in_mysteries.htm">How does Daniel 2:26 demonstrate God's sovereignty in revealing mysteries to believers?

What surprises him is, that after the wise and experienced had failed to tell him his dream, one so young and a mere novice should succeed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span> The variations in the versions are here unimportant, save that the Septuagint interpolates "in the Chaldee tongue" before the Babylonian name of Daniel. It is also to be noted that here, as throughout, the Babylonian name of Daniel, in beth the Greek versions, appears as <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, the same form in which they give Belshazzar. When Daniel is brought in before the king, Nebuchadnezzar demands if he can fulfil his promise, and tell the dream as well as the interpretation. There is no indication that Nebuchadnezzar remembered anything of the youth who had done well in the examination held in his presence some months before. This certainly is confirmatory of Wieseler's hypothesis. That the king should have forgotten, however, is nothing extraordinary, for the occasions of this kind would be many. Nebuchadnezzar, in the case of the young Hebrew, does not question his willingness to tell him what he wishes, but only his ability. With regard to the wise men, he believed, or professed to believe, in their ability to do what he wished, and reckoned their refusal to answer him as due to obstinacy or treason. It may be that he has moderated somewhat the rancour of his ire, and is willing to recognize their ignorance as to dreams and such light furniture of the mind as not militating against their claim to knowledge in other directions, only for his oath's sake he must demand that the dream be told him by at least some one. It may be that there was a certain emphasis on the pronoun when Nebuchadnezzar demanded of Daniel, "Is there to thee the power to declare to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?" Is there to thee, mere student of the sacred mysteries as thou art, alien as thou art, a hostage from a city whose king I overthrew easily? It certainly must have been strange to Nebuchadnezzar that what the soothsayers, astrologers, and magicians of the court, the highest, and reputed to be the most skilful of their respective guilds, could not do, this young Hebrew proclaimed himself able to perform. It may be observed that while in the narrative the author calls the prophet by his sacred name Daniel, "the Divine judge," here in the presence of Nebuchadnezzar, the court name he had received is introduced. To his friends, to his fellow-countrymen, he is Daniel; but as a court official he is Belteshazzar, or perhaps Belshazzar. It may be that there is intended to be conveyed to us that not only was he introduced into the royal presence as Belshazzar, but that the king addressed him," Belteshazzar (Belshazzar), art thou able?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">responded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Daniel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
