This decree was a result of the jealousy and manipulation of the other administrators and satraps who sought to trap Daniel. The signing of the document represents the legal and political challenges faced by believers in a hostile environment. It highlights the tension between obeying earthly authorities and remaining faithful to God's commandments.<p><b>he went into his house</b><br>Daniel's decision to return to his house indicates his commitment to private devotion despite public pressure. His house served as a sanctuary for worship and prayer, reflecting the importance of having a personal space dedicated to spiritual practices. This act of returning home underscores the principle of maintaining one's faith in the face of external threats.<p><b>where the windows of his upper room opened toward Jerusalem</b><br>The orientation of Daniel's windows toward Jerusalem is significant. It reflects the Jewish custom of praying toward the holy city, as seen in Solomon's prayer in <a href="/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, where he asks God to hear the prayers of His people directed toward the temple. This practice symbolizes a longing for the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple, serving as a reminder of God's promises and the hope of redemption.<p><b>and three times a day he got down on his knees</b><br>Praying three times a day was a disciplined practice, demonstrating Daniel's commitment to regular communion with God. Kneeling is a posture of humility and submission, indicating reverence and earnestness in prayer. This practice aligns with <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>, where David speaks of praying evening, morning, and noon, showing a consistent and devoted prayer life.<p><b>prayed, and gave thanks to his God</b><br>Despite the threat of persecution, Daniel continued to pray and give thanks, showing his unwavering faith and trust in God. His prayers likely included petitions for deliverance and expressions of gratitude for God's past faithfulness. This act of thanksgiving amidst trials is a powerful testament to Daniel's character and reliance on God, echoing the exhortation in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a> to give thanks in all circumstances.<p><b>just as he had done before</b><br>Daniel's consistency in prayer, even after the decree, highlights his steadfastness and integrity. His unchanged behavior in the face of danger demonstrates a life of habitual faithfulness and obedience to God. This phrase emphasizes the importance of spiritual discipline and the courage to maintain one's convictions regardless of external pressures, serving as a model for believers to follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.

There is nothing ostentatious in Daniel's prayer. He removed the lattices (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm" title="And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and on each post were palm trees.">Ezekiel 40:16</a>) from his window, that he might see as far as possible in the direction of Jerusalem, and then continued his devotions just as though the king's decree had not been recorded. The prophet must by this time have been close upon ninety years of age, but still his faith is as firm and unwavering as that of his three companions many years before. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</span>. The Septuagint rendering differs only slightly from the Massoretic. "And when Daniel knew the decree which was passed (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) against him, he opened the windows of his upper chamber, and fell on his face three times a day, according as he did aforctimc, and prayed." The Septuagint translator read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, "against him," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, "went." It seems to us that the Massoretic reading, "went to his house," is an addition due to misreading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>. That the variations of the Septuagint arc not due to paraphrase is proved by the tact that the next clause is literally translated. It would seem that the text before the LXX. had been altered, so that we have "fell upon his face," instead of "knelt upon his knees." The former phrase is an echo from <a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>. It is to be observed that "prayed and gave thanks" is omitted from the Septuagint. As the omission can have no purpose, and we can understand the reason of the words being added, we prefer the LXX. reading here. Theodotion and the Peshitta are at one with the Massoretic. The action of Daniel is here that of a man of true conscientiousness; he does not obtrude his religion now that the practice of it implies danger, as did some Christian fanatics in the persecution of the three first centuries; nor, on the other hand, does he hide his acts of worship - he simply continued his previous habits. Had a Jewish fanatic of the time of the Maccabees written this, the action attributed to Daniel would have been much more uncompromising, as the story in the Midrash Rabba of Moses in regard to the crown of Pharaoh. Or Daniel would be represented as doing, as the Jews arc said in Third Maccabees to have done to Ptolemy, bowing himself down in humble abasement before the king, to get him to reverse his decree, or, if not, to devise some means of its effect being averted. Daniel does none of these things. <span class="accented">His windows being open toward Jerusalem.</span> The windows were lattices, and as the room was an upper one on the roof of the house, the opening of the windows enabled everything done in the apartment to be seen. The practice of prayer "toward Jerusalem" is acknowledged to have arisen in Babylon during the Captivity. Solomon, in his prayer at the dedication of the temple, refers to the contingency of captivity (<a href="/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a>), and prays that if the captives "pray unto thee toward their land, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy Name, then hear thou their prayer" (see also <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a> [7]). The practice of praying towards a particular point has been maintained by the Mohammedans, who pray towards Mecca. Mohammed originally made Jerusalem the <span class="accented">qiblah</span>, or point of prayer; but the Jews would not receive him as their Messiah, and so from Jerusalem it was changed to Mecca. The objection of Bertholdt hardly needs to be mentioned, that "the temple was in ruins" - the place was holy ground. "Three times a day" is referred to <a href="/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a> (17), "Evening and morning and at noonday will I complain." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
