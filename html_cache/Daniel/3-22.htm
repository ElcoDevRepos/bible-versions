In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's decree was law, and immediate obedience was expected. This urgency underscores the king's anger and determination to enforce his will, as seen earlier in the chapter when he demands worship of the golden image.<p><b>and the furnace so hot</b><br>The furnace, likely a large industrial kiln used for smelting metals or baking bricks, was heated to an extreme temperature. Archaeological findings suggest such furnaces were common in Babylon, capable of reaching high temperatures. The intense heat symbolizes the severity of the trial faced by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and sets the stage for the miraculous deliverance that follows.<p><b>that the fiery flames killed the men</b><br>This detail highlights the lethal danger of the situation and the miraculous nature of the deliverance. The death of the soldiers emphasizes the supernatural protection over Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. It also serves as a narrative device to demonstrate the power of God over the king's might.<p><b>who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b><br>The act of carrying up the three men suggests a position of elevation, possibly indicating a pit-like structure for the furnace. The mention of their names reinforces their identity and faithfulness to God, contrasting with the fate of the soldiers.

Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.">Daniel 2:15</a>). The king's command had been uttered while he was in a furious rage, and in consequence of this, the furnace was raised to so high a temperature that the executioners were slain. The death of the executioners forms an evident contrast with the deliverance of those who had been sentenced to die.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> The rendering of the Greek versions <span class="accented">seems</span> to have suffered from the interpolation of the Song of the Three Holy Children - the verses before us have been altered to prepare for the introduction of the song. The LXX. translates as follows: "Since the king's command was urgent, and the furnace heated sevenfold more than it had previously been, the men who had been appointed, when they had bound them and brought them forward to the furnace, cast them in. Then the flame which blazed in the furnace came forth and slew the men who had bound those about Azarias, but they themselves were preserved." Theodotion renders, "Since the word of the king was urgent, and the furnace was excessively heated, and these three men fell down bound into the burning fiery furnace, and they fell into the midst of the furnace. and walked about, singing praises to God, blessing the Lord." There is nothing here, it may be noted, about those that bound the three friends being slain; there is also to be noted the addition, "walking about and singing praises to God and blessing the Lord." The Peshitta also suffers, though to a less degree. The rendering with it is, "Therefore the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace blazed exceedingly, and slew the men who accused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the midst of the furnace of great fire." Here a marvel is added, not those that threw the Hebrews into the fire were burnt, but their accusers. We must discuss separately the Song of the Three Holy Children. The furnace implied is one filled from above, but having a doorway at the side. The witnesses for the truth of monotheism and of the supreme Godhead of Jehovah were carried to the top of this furnace, and cast in amongst the fuel. We have nothing to do with how the miracle of their preservation was accomplished, we have only to do with the narrative as given. The fact that those who carried them and threw them in were killed gives proof positive of the fierceness of the heat. The fact stated in the twenty-third verse, that they fell into the midst of the furnace, excludes any supposition that they escaped by being sheltered from the fierceness of the heat. Separating the two portions of the apocryphal addition to this chapter, the song of Azarias from the united song of the three, we have a statement that "the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven, and made the midst as it had been a moist whistling wind; so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them." This abundance of detail as to the -method by which the miracle was wrought is evidence of a later time. We shall, however, leave the discussion of the date of this addition till later. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">command</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4406.htm">Strong's 4406: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, command, discourse, subject</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was so urgent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7717;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2685.htm">Strong's 2685: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shear, cut close, to be severe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the furnace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#363;&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
