The context is the jealousy and malice of the other administrators and satraps who were envious of Daniel's favor with King Darius. Their approach to the king was strategic, intending to manipulate the king's authority for their own purposes. This reflects the political intrigue common in ancient courts, where advisors often vied for power and influence.<p><b>&#8220;Did you not sign a decree that for thirty days any man who petitions any god or man except you, O king,</b><br>The decree was designed to elevate King Darius to a god-like status temporarily, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures where rulers were often deified. This decree was a test of loyalty to the king, but it was also a trap for Daniel, who was known for his unwavering devotion to the God of Israel. The exclusivity of the decree highlights the cultural and religious tensions present in the Medo-Persian Empire, where multiple religions and gods were worshipped.<p><b>will be thrown into the den of lions?&#8221;</b><br>The punishment of being thrown into a den of lions was a method of execution that underscored the absolute power of the king and the severity of disobedience. Lions were symbols of royal authority and power in ancient Mesopotamia. This punishment was intended to instill fear and ensure compliance with the king's edicts. The den of lions also serves as a foreshadowing of Daniel's miraculous deliverance, which prefigures Christ's victory over death.<p><b>The king replied, &#8220;According to the law of the Medes and Persians the order stands, and it cannot be repealed.&#8221;</b><br>The reference to the law of the Medes and Persians indicates the unchangeable nature of royal decrees in this empire. This legal principle is significant because it underscores the king's inability to save Daniel, despite his personal favor towards him. It highlights the rigidity of human laws compared to the sovereignty of God, who ultimately delivers Daniel. This immutability of the law contrasts with the grace and mercy found in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the kingdom of Darius.

The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not, Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him</span>. The version of the Septuagint, as usual, differs from the Massoretic text," Then these men interceded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) with the king, and said, King Darius, didst thou not confirm a decree that no man should offer prayer or present petition to any god for thirty days, save only to thee, O king, otherwise he should be cast into the den of lions? And the king answered and said, The word is clear, and the decree remaineth. And they said to him, We adjure thee by the laws of the Medes and the Persians that thou change not the commandment, nor be an accepter of persons (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), nor diminish aught of the thing spoken, but punish the man that abideth not by this decree. And he said, This will I do, according as ye have said, and the thing is con- firmed (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>) by me. And they said, Behold, we found Daniel, thy friend, praying, and making entreaty before his God three times a day. [And the king, being grieved, spake to cast Daniel into the den of lions, according to the decree which he decreed against him.] Then the king grieved exceedingly concerning Daniel, and laboured (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) till the going down of the sun to deliver him out of the hands of the satraps." One of the verses here seems to have been an addition most probably to the Aramaic text, as the Semitic spirit and construction shine through. There is, further, an obvious instance of doublet; the clause within square brackets has all the appearance of being a marginal note summarizing the contents of the verse. The words, "out of the hands of the satraps," have been added as explanatory. Theodotion is in practical agreement with the Massoretictext. The Peshitta differs in some minor points, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> inserting the common Eastern mode of addressing royalty, "O king, live for ever." The clause, "concerning the decree," is omitted; the other differences are unimportant. The fact that his Jewish origin is put in the front of their accusation of him indicates what Daniel's great offence was. The Septuagint places the fact that he was the king's friend in that position. It seems little likely that even to a satrap would any courtier venture to bring forward a taunting reference to his friendships. The king is caught in a trap; but no courtier would venture to press his advantage, lest he himself be taken at unawares. Darius's efforts to save Daniel are to be noted. His effort would most probably be directed to find some way out of the constitutional dilemma into which he had been entrapped. His subordinate position, occupying the place of King of Babylon merely for a season instead of Cyrus, would make it more difficult for him to override any constitutional maxim. In the Septuagint the presidents seem to compel the king by moral arguments - a thing float seems possible, though also a feature that might very naturally be added to the story. In the Massoretic text there is an endeavor to poison the king against Daniel. Daniel has despised the king and his commandment. This is more natural than the conduct imputed to the presidents in the Septuagint. These efforts were not successful, as probably they scarcely expected they would be; the king is convinced of his own hastiness, and of their treachery also, but not of any failure on the part of Daniel, in due respect to him, as the representative of the great king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1440;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they approached</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb -
