This reflects the Babylonian reliance on occult practices for guidance, contrasting with the Hebrew reliance on God&#8217;s revelation. The king's immediate call to these figures highlights the desperation and fear he felt upon seeing the mysterious writing. This mirrors earlier events in the Book of Daniel, where Nebuchadnezzar also sought the counsel of such figures, only to find them lacking compared to Daniel's God-given wisdom.<p><b>and he said to these wise men of Babylon</b><br>The term "wise men" in Babylonian culture referred to those skilled in interpreting dreams and omens, often holding significant influence in the royal court. This phrase underscores the king's expectation that these men, with their supposed wisdom, could provide answers. However, it also sets the stage for their failure, emphasizing the superiority of divine wisdom over human knowledge.<p><b>&#8220;Whoever reads this inscription and tells me its interpretation</b><br>The king's challenge to read and interpret the inscription indicates the mysterious and supernatural nature of the writing. This situation parallels earlier chapters where Daniel interprets dreams and visions that others cannot. The inability of the wise men to interpret the writing foreshadows the revelation of God's power and the futility of relying on human wisdom.<p><b>will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck</b><br>Purple clothing and a gold chain were symbols of high honor and authority in ancient cultures, often reserved for royalty or high-ranking officials. This reward reflects the king's desperation to understand the writing, offering significant incentives to anyone who could provide the interpretation. It also highlights the cultural importance of status and wealth in Babylonian society.<p><b>and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.&#8221;</b><br>The offer to become the third highest ruler suggests that Belshazzar was co-regent with his father, Nabonidus, making the position of third ruler the highest available honor he could bestow. This detail aligns with historical records of the Babylonian empire's governance structure. It also underscores the gravity of the situation, as the king was willing to offer substantial power to solve the mystery, setting the stage for Daniel's eventual rise to prominence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_belshazzar.htm">King Belshazzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon during the time of this event.

We must either suppose that they are included under the general term "Chaldeans," or that the king in his terror forgot to summon them. The "wise men" spoken of (<a href="/daniel/5-8.htm" title="Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 5:8</a>) were the body over which Daniel was president--a post which it appears. from <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm" title="And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.">Daniel 8:27</a>, he held at this time. It is needless to discuss why Daniel did not come in at first.<p><span class= "bld">The third ruler.--</span>See <span class= "ital">Excursus C.</span> Those who adopt another view of Belshazzar maintain that a triumvirate existed at this time similar to that in the days of Darius the Mede (<a href="/daniel/6-2.htm" title="And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.">Daniel 6:2</a>), and that the king promises to raise to the rank of "<span class= "ital">triumvir"</span> the person who could interpret the vision successfully. It may be noticed that the form of the ordinal "third," both here and in <a href="/daniel/5-16.htm" title="And I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if you can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, you shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.">Daniel 5:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm" title="Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.">Daniel 5:29</a>, is very peculiar, and that in the last two passages it resembles a substantive rather than an adjective. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom</span>. The Septuagint here also differs from the Massoretic text, "And the king cried out with a great cry to call in the enchanters (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c2;</span>) and sorcerers (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), and Chaldeans, and soothsayers, to announce to him the interpretation of the writing, and they came in for inspection (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), to see the writing, And they were not able to make known to the king the interpretation of the writing. Then the king made commandment, saying, Any man who shall show the interpretation of the writing, he shall put on him a purple robe, and shall put round his neck a golden chain, and authority shall be given him over a third part of the kingdom." Theodotion is an exact rendering of the Massoretic text in the sense represented by the English versions, save that it wholly omits the conjunctions between the various classes of wise men, so that <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> might be an adjective qualifying either <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, and the article is also omitted, which is represented in the Massoretic text by the <span class="accented">status emphaticus.</span> The Peshitta has four classes of wise men called in; as the Septuagint has, otherwise it agrees with the Massoretic text. It is a matter of some interest to observe that the position of the Chaldeans is somewhat precarious here, as in the second chapter. They disappear wholly from the list in the next verse, which really seems to be another version of this. It is a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. If we accept the reading of the Septuagint here, so far at least as to assume the entrance of the wise men before the king's declaration of the reward, the succession of events becomes more natural. The king calls for the presence of these interpreters of omens, and then, when they fail to interpret the writing to him, he proclaims his offer of a reward to whoever can do so. It is to be noted that there is in the Septuagint no question of ability to read the writing, but simply to interpret it. It has been pointed out to me by a friend that if these words were written in cuneiform, the signs that would represent them might have a great variety of possible sounds, and with these differing sounds, differing meanings. Sometimes a sign was phonetic and a syllable, sometimes it was idiographic and might represent a whole word. There is this to be said for this view - the Assyrian was the writing expected in inscriptions. Still, from the fact that the Septuagint omits the demand that the inscription should be read, we may regard the matter as doubtful. Assuming that the wise men were required to read the inscription, some of the Jewish interpreters, as Jephet-ibn-Ali, think that the letters of the word were inverted; others have it that the letters were arranged in columns. Even, however, if the words were written correctly enough as Aramaic words, it would be a difficult matter to put any meaning in them as they stood, as we shall see when we consider Daniel's interpretation. The reward promised is of special interest. The word <span class="accented">argvana</span>, translated "scarlet," appears in Assyrian as <span class="accented">argmamm</span>; <span class="accented">hamneeka</span>, the word rendered "necklace," is of doubtful origin. We find in the Ninevite sculptures and on the cylinders from Babylon many instances of splendid robes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rawlinson, 'Five Great Monarchies,' 560); the rich necklace is also to be seen (ibid., 2. 497,499). The great difficulty has arisen over the rank given to Daniel, "the third ruler in the kingdom." The difficulty is that the ordinal here is not in its usual form, although Petermann gives <span class="accented">taltu</span> as one of the forms of the ordinal. There is, further, the unusual position of the numeral in relation to the verb, though the abnormality is less than Professor Bevan represents it, as the Peshitta follows word for word the arrangement of the Massoretic text. The truth seems to be that the word really was <span class="accented">toolta</span>, as in the Syriac, and the difficulty has risen in not recognizing the transference from one dialect of Aramaic to another. It is used in the Peshitta (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>) of the third heaven. Professor Bevan's interpretation, that it means "<span class="accented">every</span> third day,') may be dismissed as absurd. Ewald (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) regards the title as one of a board of three - not an in,possible meaning, in the light of what we find in the following chapter. Yet his reasoning, that it cannot be third in rank, because the queen-mother could not be counted in, is inept now, when we learn that Belshazzar was colleague with his father, and so the third place was all he had to give. On this question Behrmann takes the view discarded as impossible by Ewald, and holds that Daniel was placed third because of the queen-mother. It is one of the commonplaces of the criticism of this book that the history ascribed to Daniel is borrowed from the history of Joseph: why was the position offered not made "second," as was that of Joseph? We have the reason in what we know of the history of Babylon at the time. The Septuagint and Josephus were unaware of the facts, and translated as they did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called out for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7123.htm">Strong's 7123: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, read out or aloud</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the enchanters,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;p&#772;ay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
