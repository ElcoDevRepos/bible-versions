In the context of <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>, God reveals King Nebuchadnezzar's dream and its interpretation to Daniel, showcasing His power to disclose divine secrets. This aligns with other biblical instances where God reveals hidden truths, such as Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams (Genesis 41) and the revelation of mysteries in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>). The phrase underscores the belief that God alone possesses the wisdom to unveil what is concealed, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>He knows what lies in darkness,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's omnipresence and His ability to perceive what is hidden from human sight. Darkness often symbolizes ignorance, evil, or the unknown in biblical literature. God's knowledge of what lies in darkness suggests His sovereignty over all creation, including the unseen spiritual realm. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>, where even darkness is not dark to God. The phrase reassures believers of God's control and awareness, even in situations that seem obscure or threatening.<p><b>and light dwells with Him.</b><br>Light is frequently used in the Bible as a metaphor for purity, truth, and divine presence. In this context, it signifies God's inherent nature as the source of all truth and righteousness. The imagery of light dwelling with God is consistent with passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, which states that "God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all." This phrase also points to Jesus Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, indicating that divine illumination and guidance are found in Him. The presence of light with God assures believers of His guidance and the revelation of truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew prophet and wise man in Babylon, known for his ability to interpret dreams and visions through God's revelation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to Daniel's involvement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and other Israelites were exiled, serving as the backdrop for the events in the Book of Daniel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the revealer of mysteries and the one who possesses all knowledge and light.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>The mysterious dream of King Nebuchadnezzar that prompted Daniel to seek God's wisdom for its interpretation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows all things, both seen and unseen.

When God discloses Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream, He reminds us that<p>&#8226; Nothing is beyond His ability to uncover (<a href="/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>: &#8220;He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.&#8221;).<p>&#8226; He loves to share secrets with those who revere Him (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>: &#8220;The LORD confides in those who fear Him; He reveals His covenant to them.&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By the Spirit, He still opens spiritual truths to believers today (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>: &#8220;God has revealed it to us by the Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.&#8221;).<p>What Daniel experienced in Babylon becomes a standing promise: the God of heaven gladly pulls back the curtain for those who seek Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He knows what lies in darkness</b><p>Human vision stalls where shadows fall, but God&#8217;s sight pierces every veil.<p>&#8226; Nothing in creation can be hidden (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>: &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Darkness cannot conceal evil or fear from Him (<a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>: &#8220;Even the darkness is not dark to You; the night shines like the day&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; His omniscience exposes every hidden agenda (<a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>: &#8220;&#8216;Can a man hide in secret places so that I cannot see him?&#8217; declares the LORD.&#8221;).<p>For Daniel, this meant confidence that the God who saw the emperor&#8217;s private dream also saw His servant praying for mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Light dwells with Him</b><p>God is not merely a possessor of light; light is at home in His very presence.<p>&#8226; &#8220;God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; He clothes Himself &#8220;in light as with a garment&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus embodies that light for us: &#8220;I am the light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p>Because light dwells with Him, coming near to God means gaining clarity, purity, and guidance. For Daniel, the revelation of the king&#8217;s dream was a foretaste of the ultimate illumination found in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a> celebrates a God who uncovers mysteries, sees through darkness, and radiates unapproachable light. He invites His people to rely on His perfect knowledge and to walk in the illumination that flows from His presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">He revealeth.--</span>Comp. <a href="/job/12-22.htm" title="He discovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.">Job 12:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He knoweth.</span>--Comp. <a href="/psalms/139-12.htm" title="Yes, the darkness hides not from you; but the night shines as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to you.">Psalm 139:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The light dwelleth.--</span>Perhaps "illumination" rather than "light" expresses the actual meaning. Man himself requires illumination from an external source. This source is God, the "sun of man's soul," in Whom light dwells as if He were a palace, and in "His light do we see light" (<a href="/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the light dwelleth with him</span>. The rendering of the Septuagint as it stands differs somewhat from the Massoretic text, "Revealing deep things and dark, and knowing the things which are in the darkness and the things which are in the light, and with him is a dwelling-place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." There is doubt as to the exact force of this last word; the last element in it suggests "solution." This meaning seems to have been given to it generally; for Paulus Tellensis renders it <span class="accented">shari</span>, which means a "solution," but as it is derived from <span class="accented">shera</span>, which means "to dwell," he retains the double meaning The reading of Kreysig is decidedly to be preferred, omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> ("the things which") before "in the light," and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, "and," after. The rendering then would be, "in light is with him the dwelling-place." This rendering harmonizes the LXX. completely with the Massoretic. The other versions call for no remark. There is difference here between the Q'rl and K'thib. The Q'ri reads <span class="accented">nehora</span>, "light," a Chaldee or Western Aramaic form; the K'thib again is, <span class="accented">neheera</span>, the Eastern Aramaic form. God is not only the God of nature, of providence, and of man, but also of revelation. He can make known to man what otherwise man could never know. He is the very Source of all light and enlightenment. We may compare this statement with that of Paul in <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>; he speaks of God as "dwelling in light which no man can approach unto." It seems to us the words of the Old Testament song convey a loftier idea of God than does the Pauline statement - perhaps it is even loftier than the cognate phrase of the Apostle John (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." We may compare, in regard to this whole verse, <a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>, "The darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the tight are both alike to thee," where <span class="accented">neheera</span> is used as in the passage before us. Daniel ascribes to Jehovah all the powers of all the gods of Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1932.htm">Strong's 1932: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reveals</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1541.htm">Strong's 1541: </a> </span><span class="str2">To denude, to exile, to reveal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the deep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5994.htm">Strong's 5994: </a> </span><span class="str2">Profound, unsearchable</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and hidden things;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;sat&#183;t&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
