This role would have involved overseeing the king's personal security and executing royal decrees. The name Arioch is of Akkadian origin, meaning "servant of the moon god," reflecting the polytheistic culture of Babylon. The presence of a commander like Arioch highlights the structured military and administrative system of Babylon, a dominant empire of the ancient Near East.<p><b>went out to execute the wise men of Babylon,</b><br>The wise men of Babylon included magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers, who were considered the intellectual elite and advisors to the king. The decree to execute them was a result of their inability to interpret King Nebuchadnezzar's troubling dream, which he refused to disclose. This reflects the absolute power of the king and the precarious position of the wise men, who were expected to possess supernatural insight. The execution order underscores the tension between human wisdom and divine revelation, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>Daniel responded with discretion and tact.</b><br>Daniel's response is marked by wisdom and prudence, qualities that are emphasized throughout his life and ministry. His ability to navigate the dangerous political landscape of Babylon with discretion and tact is a testament to his reliance on God for guidance. This approach contrasts with the impulsive and harsh actions of the king, highlighting Daniel's role as a mediator and a man of faith. Daniel's response also prefigures the wisdom of Christ, who often dealt with adversaries and difficult situations with profound insight and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his wisdom, faithfulness to God, and ability to interpret dreams.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arioch.htm">Arioch</a></b><br>The commander of King Nebuchadnezzar's guard, tasked with executing the wise men of Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_babylon.htm">Wise Men of Babylon</a></b><br>A group of magicians, enchanters, and astrologers who were unable to interpret the king's dream, leading to a death decree.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and his friends were exiled, known for its wealth, power, and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_crisis.htm">Wisdom in Crisis</a></b><br>Daniel's response with wisdom and tact in a life-threatening situation teaches us the importance of seeking God's guidance in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/godly_influence.htm">Godly Influence</a></b><br>Daniel's ability to influence Arioch and eventually the king demonstrates the power of godly character and integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>Daniel's calm and wise response shows his trust in God, encouraging us to rely on faith rather than fear when facing challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/effective_communication.htm">Effective Communication</a></b><br>The way Daniel communicated with Arioch highlights the importance of speaking truth with grace and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Daniel's account reminds us that God is sovereign and can intervene in seemingly impossible situations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_14_Wisdom_tact_s_importance.htm">How does Daniel 2:14 demonstrate the importance of responding with "wisdom and tact"?

When human counsel fails, God steps in to magnify His superior revelation.

"Then Daniel spake with the counsel and knowledge which were his to Arioch the chief executioner [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span>, 'chief butcher,' used by Plutarch for 'chief cook'] of the king, to whom it was appointed to lead out the wise men (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>) of Babylonia." The text before the Septuagint translators seems to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">deeleh</span>), "which to him," equivalent to "which he had." The LXX. text had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e4;&#x5e7;</span>. Something may be said for this reading, as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> of the succeeding word may have occasioned the disappearance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, which might be regarded as a <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> defectively written. Theodotion agrees perfectly with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is somewhat of a paraphrase in regard to the first clause, "Then Daniel pacified and consulted, and said to Arioch the chief of the king's guard, who had gone out to slay the wise men of Babylon." It would seem as if there had been some confusion of the words here, though the meaning is not far from that of the other version. The Vulgate Version differs, "Then Daniel asked about the law and sentence (<span class="accented">sentientia</span>) at Arioch, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon." The slate of matters implied here reveals to us the fact that several links of the story are awanting. There seems to have been absolute secrecy as to what had taken place in the royal council-chamber, and how absolute had been the failure of the Chaldean wise men to satisfy the demands of the king. We could imagine the strange turmoil that this would have caused in the college of young cadets of the various guilds of soothsayers and augurs, had it been announced that these great heads of their various orders had failed. News may have come of the wrath of the king, and close behind the angry sentence of extirpation, passed not only on those who had been the immediate occasions of the king's wrath, but on all the gull, is of wise men in Babylon. This must have filled those who belonged to the various guilds implicated, not only with terror, but with amazement. It was next brought to them that they, though only in the lower stages of these famous guilds, were doomed to a common destruction with the past masters of the craft. That this was allowed to reach these subalterns proves that popular opinion had not gone with the fiery edict of the king. Above all, Arioch, captain "of the guard" - "of the cut-throats," as the Spanish translators have rendered it; "chief butcher," as both Theodotion and the Septuagint render his title - acts as if he is not in favour of it. lie is compelled to do the king's bidding; but he is evidently bent on going about the realtor in such a leisurely fashion that the great body of the condemned may escape. We may stay to notice that the name Arioch is a genuine Babylonian name, <span class="accented">Eri Aku</span>, "Servant of the moon-god." Professor Bevan declares it is borrowed from <a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>, as his title is from <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. It is singular that when the author's acquaintance with the earlier Scriptures was so full and accurate, he should drop into the blunders he is accused cf. In Genesis the executioner does not execute anybody; in Daniel he is represented as engaged in organizing the massacre. Daniel seems not to have waited till the terrible band of guardsmen-executioners arrived at the college where he and his friends were living, he goes direct to the chief of the band. The fact that he is not cut down immediately on his approach seems to argue that even the common guardsmen shrank from the duty imposed on them. Their horror and shrinking were perfectly natural. Let us suppose a company in a regiment of Irish Roman Catholics ordered to shoot down their own priests, and we may have some idea of the feelings of these soldiers. These augurs and soothsayers, these astrologers and magicians, had been their counsellors; they had been their intercessors with their deities. If they were all slaughtered, would not the sheer blank in their own lives be immense? There would be no one now to tell them, however falsely, of the future: no one to tell them what to do to propitiate the gods. But more, the gods might well be supposed to be enraged by the slaughter of so many of their special servants, and might be expected to pour down vengeance on the whole nation as well as on the king who had commanded it, but most of all on those who, under whatever compulsion, raised their sacrilegious hands against the priests of the holy gods. It is even not improbable that, once the immediate paroxysm of his fury had passed, Nebuchadnezzar would be appalled at what he had himself ordered, and would connive at delay, in the hope that, though late, these wise men might come to reason and tell him what he wished. Daniel seems to find no difficulty in gaining access to the presence of Arioch. There are men who have a magnetic power over their fellows, and bend every one to their way, and still gain their affection. And Daniel seems pre-eminently to have been a man of this type. Personal good looks and suave manners had their own share, but something more was needed to carry a condemned man through the ranks of guards right into the presence of their chief.
