The king's joy reflects his respect and admiration for Daniel, who had proven himself to be a faithful and trustworthy servant. This reaction also underscores the king's relief, as he had been manipulated into signing the decree that led to Daniel's predicament. The king's joy can be seen as a foreshadowing of the joy believers experience in witnessing God's deliverance.<p><b>and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den</b><br>The act of lifting Daniel out of the den signifies his deliverance from a seemingly impossible situation. The lion's den, a pit or cave used for executions, was a place of certain death. This miraculous rescue parallels other biblical accounts of deliverance, such as Joseph being lifted from the pit by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>) and Jesus' resurrection from the tomb. It symbolizes God's power to save and His sovereignty over life and death.<p><b>and when Daniel was lifted out of the den</b><br>This repetition emphasizes the miraculous nature of Daniel's survival. The den, a symbol of death and judgment, becomes a place of divine intervention. Daniel's emergence from the den can be seen as a type of resurrection, prefiguring Christ's victory over death. It also serves as a testament to God's faithfulness to those who remain steadfast in their faith.<p><b>no wounds whatsoever were found on him</b><br>The absence of wounds on Daniel is a testament to God's protection. In a den of lions, survival without injury is humanly impossible, highlighting the miraculous nature of the event. This detail echoes the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who emerged from the fiery furnace without harm (<a href="/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a>). It underscores the theme of divine preservation and protection for those who trust in God.<p><b>because he had trusted in his God</b><br>Daniel's trust in God is the key reason for his deliverance. His unwavering faith serves as a model for believers, demonstrating the power of trust in God amidst trials. This trust is not passive but active, as Daniel continued to pray and maintain his devotion despite the threat of death. This phrase connects to <a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>, which speaks of those who "through faith... shut the mouths of lions." Daniel's faith is a precursor to the faith exemplified by Jesus, who trusted the Father even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.

So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God</span>. The verse that occupies the same place in the Septuagint is not a translation of the present verse at all, but looks as if it had been a sentence in the original longer documents which followed the above Massoretic verse, "Then all the powers gathered together, and saw Daniel, that the lions had not hurt him." It is barely possible float the first clause here represents Aramaic text that might be misread into the Massoretic text. Although it is supported by the later versions, the Massoretic text has a <span class="accented">suspicions</span> appearance. The last clause is a moral reflection, unlike anything else in the Book of Daniel, and is omitted, as we saw, from the Septuagint. The assertion of the king's gladness, too, differs in colour from the other statements in the book; thus compare the language concerning Nebuchadnezzar when the three Hebrew youths were delivered from the fiery furnace. At the same time, it is to be observed that the use of the hophal form in the verb <span class="accented">hoosaq</span> is an evidence of the antiquity of this portion of the verse. The hypothesis that tins narrative has been condensed from a longer one, has much to support it. The lesson inculcated, that faith in God would result in deliverance, is very true, even though it was not in the text. The irregular form of the adjective <span class="accented">t'ayb</span> points out a possibility that there has been some modification of the text. Sometimes words not understood have resulted in known words being written in an irregular way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was overjoyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;ag&#183;g&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7690.htm">Strong's 7690: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, much</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and gave orders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_560.htm">Strong's 560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, tell, command</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to lift</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;han&#183;s&#257;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
