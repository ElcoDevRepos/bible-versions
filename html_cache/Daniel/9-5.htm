In the context of <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>, Daniel is interceding for his people during the Babylonian exile, a period of punishment for their disobedience to God. The confession of sin is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40-42</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a>, where acknowledging wrongdoing is the first step toward restoration. The Hebrew words for "sinned" and "done wrong" emphasize both the moral failure and the breach of covenant with God.<p><b>We have acted wickedly and rebelled</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of Israel's actions against God. "Wickedly" suggests intentional wrongdoing, while "rebelled" indicates a deliberate turning away from God's authority. This rebellion is reminiscent of Israel's history of idolatry and disobedience, as seen in the narratives of the Judges and Kings. The rebellion against God is a central theme in the prophetic books, where prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah call the people back to faithfulness. This rebellion is also a type of humanity's general rebellion against God, which is ultimately addressed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<p><b>We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances</b><br>This phrase underscores the specific nature of Israel's disobedience: a failure to adhere to God's laws. The "commandments and ordinances" refer to the Torah, the law given to Moses, which was meant to guide Israel in righteousness and justice. Turning away from these laws led to social injustice, idolatry, and ultimately exile. This turning away is a recurring issue in Israel's history, as seen in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The call to return to God's commandments is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus summarizes the law as love for God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>), and Paul emphasizes the law's fulfillment in Christ (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, Daniel is interceding for his people, acknowledging their collective sin before God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who have repeatedly turned away from God's commandments and are now in exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Daniel is living and praying.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord to whom Daniel is praying, acknowledging His righteousness and the people's sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, which is central to Daniel's prayer as he seeks restoration for his people and their return to their homeland.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_sin.htm">Acknowledgment of Sin</a></b><br>Daniel's prayer begins with a confession of sin, highlighting the importance of recognizing and admitting our wrongdoings before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/collective_responsibility.htm">Collective Responsibility</a></b><br>Daniel includes himself in the confession, teaching us about the importance of communal responsibility and intercession for others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/turning_away_from_god.htm">Turning Away from God</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the danger of turning away from God's commandments, reminding us to stay faithful to His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer_in_repentance.htm">The Role of Prayer in Repentance</a></b><br>Daniel's prayer is a model for how we should approach God in repentance, with humility and sincerity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_and_mercy.htm">God's Righteousness and Mercy</a></b><br>While acknowledging sin, Daniel also trusts in God's righteousness and mercy, encouraging us to seek God's forgiveness with confidence in His character.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_9_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 9:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_5_Sin_rebellion_defined.htm">How does Daniel 9:5 define sin and rebellion against God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_5_Disobedient_actions.htm">What actions in Daniel 9:5 reflect disobedience to God's commandments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_similar_sins_today_2.htm">How can we identify similar sins in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_5_Sin_s_consequences_links.htm">What scriptural connections highlight the consequences of sin mentioned in Daniel 9:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Daniel_s_confession_in_prayer.htm">How can we apply Daniel's confession in our personal prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_5_s_insight_on_sin_and_humanity.htm">What does Daniel 9:5 reveal about human nature and sinfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_5_s_role_in_Daniel_s_prayer.htm">How does Daniel 9:5 fit into the broader context of Daniel's prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_events_influenced_Daniel_9_5.htm">What historical events might have influenced the confession in Daniel 9:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_daniel_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Daniel 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'finger_of_god'_mean.htm">What does the Bible say about confessing sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_judah_in_the_bible.htm">Is the Corporate Confession of Sin biblically supported?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/non-biblical_proof_of_exiles_via_prayer.htm">2 Chronicles 6:36&#8211;39: The passage implies exiles and restorations happen in response to prayer and repentance; is there non-biblical documentation of these exiles clearly following that pattern?

He owns Israel&#8217;s guilt without excuses.<p>&#8226; Sin here is both personal and collective. Though Daniel himself lived righteously (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4</a>), he speaks in the first-person plural, identifying with his people in covenant solidarity (<a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Wrongdoing is moral deviation from God&#8217;s revealed standard. &#8220;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). No heart is exempt.<p>&#8226; True confession begins by naming sin for what it is&#8212;missing the mark of God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>) rather than blaming circumstances or culture.<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we take Daniel&#8217;s words at face value: Israel&#8217;s exile was not accidental but the righteous consequence of real actions God had previously warned against (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have acted wickedly and rebelled</b><p>Daniel moves from the fact of sin to its attitude.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Acted wickedly&#8221; points to deliberate wrongdoing. Israel&#8217;s leaders and people embraced idolatry, injustice, and hypocrisy (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rebelled&#8221; is the language of treason against a rightful King. <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> explains, &#8220;We all like sheep have gone astray; each one has turned to his own way&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Rebellion is never passive. It is conscious resistance, the same heart that Saul displayed when he refused to obey God fully (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s confession reminds us that repentance must address both deeds and the defiant spirit behind them (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances</b><p>The root of Israel&#8217;s plight was departure from God&#8217;s Word.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Turned away&#8221; pictures a decisive change of direction&#8212;choosing a path opposite the one God set out (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Commandments and ordinances encompass moral law and ceremonial instructions alike. Abandoning either part fractures covenant fellowship (<a href="/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; When God&#8217;s people neglect Scripture, drift follows swiftly: &#8220;They have forsaken the LORD; they have despised the Holy One of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel acknowledges that exile is not simply geopolitical tragedy; it is the predictable outcome of disregarding the clear, literal commands of God (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a> is a model of honest, covenant-based confession. He names sin (missing God&#8217;s mark), wicked actions (willful wrongdoing), rebellious hearts (treason against God&#8217;s rule), and the practical outworking&#8212;turning from God&#8217;s Word. By taking Scripture&#8217;s verdicts literally, Daniel shows us how to seek mercy: agree with God about our sin, reject all excuses, and return wholeheartedly to the commandments we have neglected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">We have sinned.--</span>It has been remarked that four stages of sin are pointed out by the prophet, corresponding to the four different words which he uses. "Sin" refers especially to sins of deed, "committing iniquity" to sins of word, "done wickedly" to sins of thought, "rebelled" implies the person against whom the sin has been committed. The whole result of sin under these several aspects is expressed by the words "departing from Thy precepts."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.</span> While otherwise close, neither of the Greek versions retains the change of construction before the last clause, which is exhibited in the English versions. The Peshitta fails in this way ale, but uses participles all through. This verso has a strong resemblance to <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6, 7</a>, only in Nehemiah there is more elaboration and all the signs of a later development.
