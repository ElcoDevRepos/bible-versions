God humbled him by removing him from his royal position and isolating him from human society. This act of divine judgment serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over earthly rulers. The historical context shows that Babylonian kings were seen as semi-divine figures, making Nebuchadnezzar's fall even more significant.<p><b>and his mind was like that of a beast</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's mental state was altered to resemble that of an animal, symbolizing the loss of human reason and dignity. This transformation highlights the biblical theme that pride leads to downfall and madness. Theologically, it underscores the idea that human wisdom is nothing compared to divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>.<p><b>He lived with the wild donkeys</b><br>Living with wild donkeys emphasizes Nebuchadnezzar's complete separation from human civilization and his descent into a state of nature. Wild donkeys, known for their untamed nature, symbolize the king's loss of control and status. This imagery is consistent with the biblical portrayal of wilderness as a place of testing and transformation.<p><b>and ate grass like an ox</b><br>Eating grass like an ox illustrates Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation and reduction to a beastly existence. This act signifies the stripping away of royal luxury and human pride. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment, contrasting earthly indulgence with the sustenance provided by God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>.<p><b>and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven</b><br>The phrase indicates Nebuchadnezzar's exposure to the elements, further emphasizing his vulnerability and loss of royal protection. Dew is often used in the Bible as a symbol of divine blessing and renewal (<a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>), suggesting that even in judgment, God's grace is present.<p><b>until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind</b><br>This acknowledgment marks the turning point in Nebuchadnezzar's story, where he recognizes God's ultimate authority. It reflects the biblical principle that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This confession is a key theme in Daniel, illustrating God's power over earthly kingdoms.<p><b>setting over it whom He wishes</b><br>This phrase underscores the doctrine of divine sovereignty, where God appoints rulers according to His will. It echoes the biblical narrative that God raises and deposes kings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>). This concept is a reminder of God's control over history and His ability to use even pagan rulers to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of Cyrus and Pharaoh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who was humbled by God due to his pride.
