The sending of an angel is a recurring theme in Scripture, often signifying God's protection and deliverance (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>). Angels are messengers and servants of God, acting on His behalf to accomplish His will. This intervention underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to control natural events, such as the behavior of lions.<p><b>and shut the mouths of the lions.</b><br>The shutting of the lions' mouths is a miraculous event, demonstrating God's power over creation. Lions were often used in ancient Near Eastern cultures as symbols of power and judgment, and their presence in a den was a method of execution. This miracle parallels other biblical accounts of divine deliverance, such as the protection of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3). It also prefigures Christ's victory over death, as the lions' den can be seen as a type of grave from which Daniel emerges unharmed.<p><b>They have not hurt me,</b><br>Daniel's survival is a testament to his faith and God's faithfulness. This phrase echoes the promises found in <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, where the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them. It also reflects the assurance of God's protection for those who are righteous and trust in Him, as seen throughout the Psalms and Proverbs.<p><b>for I was found innocent in His sight,</b><br>Daniel's innocence is a key theme, highlighting his integrity and faithfulness to God. This phrase suggests a divine judgment, where God, the ultimate judge, finds Daniel blameless. It aligns with the biblical principle that God vindicates the righteous (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>). Daniel's innocence before God contrasts with the false accusations of his enemies, reminiscent of Christ's own trial and crucifixion, where He was found innocent yet suffered unjustly.<p><b>and I have done no wrong against you, O king.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's statement to the king underscores his loyalty and respect for earthly authority, consistent with biblical teachings on submission to governing authorities (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>). Despite the unjust decree, Daniel maintains his integrity, reflecting the biblical principle of being in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). This phrase also highlights the tension between obeying God and human authorities, a theme explored in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, where Peter and the apostles declare, "We must obey God rather than men."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.
