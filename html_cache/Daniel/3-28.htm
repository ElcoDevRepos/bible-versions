Nebuchadnezzar, known for his pride and idolatry, recognizes the power of the God of Israel. This moment is significant as it shows a shift in his perception, albeit temporary, towards the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Historically, Babylonian kings were seen as divine or semi-divine figures, making this declaration even more remarkable.<p><b>Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b><br>The blessing of God by a foreign king underscores the impact of the miraculous deliverance. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and rulers. This phrase also emphasizes the personal relationship between God and His faithful servants, as He is specifically identified as their God. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God is praised by non-Israelites, such as Pharaoh acknowledging God's power in Exodus.<p><b>who has sent His angel and delivered His servants</b><br>The mention of an angel suggests divine intervention, a common theme in the Old Testament where angels act as messengers or agents of God's will. This deliverance is reminiscent of other biblical accounts, such as the angelic protection of Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6) and the deliverance of Peter from prison (Acts 12). The angel here is often seen as a type of Christ, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus.<p><b>who trusted in Him</b><br>Trust in God is a central theme throughout Scripture, and this phrase highlights the faith of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Their unwavering trust serves as a model for believers, illustrating the principle that faith can lead to divine protection and deliverance. This trust is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, the "faith chapter," which commends those who trusted God despite facing severe trials.<p><b>They violated the king&#8217;s command and risked their lives</b><br>This phrase underscores the courage and conviction of the three men, who chose obedience to God over compliance with human authority. Their actions reflect the biblical principle of obeying God rather than men, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>. The willingness to face death rather than compromise their faith is a powerful testament to their devotion and serves as an example of true discipleship.<p><b>rather than serve or worship any god except their own God</b><br>The exclusivity of worship is a recurring theme in the Bible, beginning with the First Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase highlights the monotheistic faith of the Israelites in a polytheistic culture. The refusal to worship other gods is a testament to their understanding of God's unique sovereignty and holiness. This commitment to exclusive worship is a precursor to the New Testament call to worship God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who erected a golden statue and commanded all to worship it.

Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, as otherwise do the other two versions. We may regard this as the beginning of the royal decree revoking practically that previously promulgated, omitting only the statement of the titles of the monarch. The wording is somewhat peculiar, "Blessed be their God - of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego." It may indicate that some words in the immediate context have been omitted; in other words, that the editor, in quoting the decree, has endeavoured, as far as possible, to condense without changing the words of the document. Bertholdt is mistaken in maintaining that this declaration is that the God of the three Hebrews is worthy of being blessed. All that Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges in this verse is that Jehovah really exists - that he is powerful, and the Hebrews did right to continue in the worship of their national God. We find that the <span class="accented">bar-eloheen</span> of ver. 25 is now regarded by Nebuchadnezzar as an angel, or, as we ought rather to translate it, "messenger." We have no need to import Hebrew ideas into the declaration of the Babylonian monarch. It was quite in accordance with his mythological notions that a great God like the God of the Hebrews might have a messenger, who was his instrument in the deliverance of his servants. The reading of the Massoretes, "changed," is to be preferred to "despised." To one like Nebuchadnezzar, stiff to obstinacy in his opinions, for anything to compel him to change not only his opinions, but more, to alter a decree, was a strange thing, and a thing that he would think worthy of chronicling. At the same time, he might feel it needed a justification. On the other hand, such a one as Nebuchadnezzar would not advertise the fact that any one had "despised" his "word." It is to be observed that Nebuchadnezzar recognizes not only the deliverance as an evidence of the truth of Jehovah's Divinity, but also the willingness with which his servants were ready to offer their bodies to be burnt. The evidence that compelled Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge the might of Jehovah was the same in essence as that which converted the Roman Empire. Still, we must again repeat Nebuchadnezzar recognized in Jehovah only the God of the Jews, and in the fatthfulness of the three Hebrews only a species of religious patriotism, which he could at once understand and respect without having the slightest belief in monotheism, or even comprehension of such a 'notion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declared,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Blessed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1289.htm">Strong's 1289: </a> </span><span class="str2">To kneel, to bless God, man, to curse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1458;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;h&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
