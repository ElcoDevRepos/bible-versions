In the context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, it likely represents Roman forces. This phrase indicates a military intervention by a powerful naval force, which historically aligns with Roman intervention in the region. The "ships of Kittim" symbolize a formidable opposition that disrupts the plans of the king of the North, traditionally identified as Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This intervention is a turning point, as it halts his campaign against Egypt.<p><b>and he will lose heart</b><br>The phrase "lose heart" suggests a significant emotional and strategic setback for Antiochus IV. Historically, this aligns with the Roman envoy Gaius Popillius Laenas confronting Antiochus and demanding his withdrawal from Egypt. The king's loss of heart reflects his recognition of Roman supremacy and the futility of resisting their demands. This moment of humiliation is pivotal, as it forces him to abandon his ambitions in Egypt.<p><b>Then he will turn back and rage against the holy covenant and do damage</b><br>Frustrated by his defeat, Antiochus redirects his anger towards Jerusalem and the Jewish people, who are under the "holy covenant" with God. This phrase captures his subsequent persecution of the Jews, including the desecration of the Temple and the suppression of Jewish religious practices. This act of rage is a fulfillment of earlier prophecies about the suffering of God's people and serves as a precursor to the abomination of desolation mentioned later in Daniel.<p><b>So he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant</b><br>Antiochus seeks to consolidate his power by aligning with Hellenized Jews who abandon their faith. These individuals, who forsake the "holy covenant," are rewarded for their apostasy, receiving political and social favor. This division among the Jewish people highlights the internal strife and the pressure to conform to Hellenistic culture. Theologically, this phrase underscores the theme of faithfulness versus compromise, a recurring motif in biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/ships_of_kittim.htm">Ships of Kittim</a></b><br>Refers to naval forces, traditionally associated with the western regions, possibly Cyprus or the Roman Empire.

And he shall do and return, and have understanding against those who have been left to the holy covenant." The Peshitta renders more in harmony with the Massoretic text, "Those who come against them from the lines of Chittim, even they shall break him, and he shall turn and be enraged against the holy covenant, and shall have understanding with them that forsake the holy covenant." The rendering of the Vulgate is singular, "And there shall come against him trieres (ships of war, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and Romans, and he shall be, beaten, and shall return, and shall be enraged against the testament (<span class="accented">testamentum</span>, covenant) of the holy place and shall do, he shall even return and shall devise against those who have left the testament (<span class="accented">testamebtum</span>) of the holy place." The ships of Chittim are the Roman ships, bearing the envoys of the Senate with C. Popilius Laenas at their head. He delivered to Anti,bus the tablets on which were inscribed the wishes of the Senate. Antiochus was then on the eve of commencing the siege of Alexandria, and completing the conquest of Egypt. Having read that the Senate of Rome desired him to refrain from attacking the allies of the Republic, Antiochus said he would answer after con-suiting with his friends. Lsenas drew a circle round him with his staff on the sand, and demanded that he should give his answer before he left the circle. Antiochus had to submit. <span class="accented">Shall have indignation against the holy covenant.</span> It is not certain whether Antiochus was present personally at the plunder of Jerusalem or superintended the massacre of the Jews; but it is practically certain that at this time began the systematic attempt to put down Judaism. <span class="accented">And have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</span> It is not improbable that Antiochus was encouraged to make the attempt he did, by the fact that so many persons high in position were Hellenizers (1 Macc. 1:11-15, in which there is reference to those that forsook the holy covenant). The desire of Antiochus was probably to make his empire more homogeneous. The Jews, he would see by the fact that they had a national unity apart from his empire, might at times be thorns in his side - might become allies of Rome if he were compelled to engage in war with the Republic. It was their religion that was the bond which united the nation; let that be broken, then there would be a chance of the Jews blending harmoniously with the other races that made up the Syrian Empire. Those that forsook the holy covenant made him think it an easy task. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ships</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#238;&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6716.htm">Strong's 6716: </a> </span><span class="str2">A ship</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Kittim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(kit&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3794.htm">Strong's 3794: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kittim -- a son of Javan, also his descendants and their land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
