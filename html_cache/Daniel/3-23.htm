For in truth and in judgment, you have brought down all these things because of our sins. <V 3:29>For we have sinned, and we have committed iniquity in withdrawing from you, and we have offended in all things. <V 3:30>And we have not listened to your precepts, nor have we observed or done as you have ordered us, so that it might go well with us. <V 3:31>Therefore, everything that you have brought upon us, and all that you have done for us, you have done in true judgment. <V 3:32>And you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies:  traitors, unjust and most wicked, and to a king, unjust and most wicked, even more so than all others on earth. <V 3:33>And now we are not able to open our mouths. We have become a shame and a disgrace to your servants and to those who worship you. <V 3:34>Do not hand us over forever, we ask you, because of your name, and do not abolish your covenant. <V 3:35>And do not withdraw your mercy from us, because of Abraham, your beloved, and Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one. <V 3:36>You have spoken with them, promising that you would multiply their offspring like the stars of heaven and like the sand on the seashore. <V 3:37>For we, O Lord, are diminished more than all other peoples, and we are brought low throughout all the earth, this day, because of our sins. <V 3:38>Neither is there, at this time, a leader, or a ruler, or a prophet, nor any holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of first fruits, in your eyes, <V 3:39>so that we may be able to find your mercy. Nevertheless, with a contrite soul and humble spirit, let us be accepted. <V 3:40>Just as in the holocausts of rams and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs, so let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, in order to please you. For there is no shame for those who trust in you. <V 3:41>And now we follow you wholeheartedly, and we fear you, and we seek your face. <V 3:42>Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in agreement with your clemency and according to the multitude of your mercies. <V 3:43>And rescue us by your wonders and give glory to your name, O Lord. <V 3:44>And let all those be confounded who lead your servants towards evil. May they be confounded by all your power and may their strength be crushed. <V 3:45>And may they know that you are the Lord, the only God, and glorious above the world.&#8221; <V 3:46>And they did not cease, those attendants of the king who had cast them in, to heat the furnace with oil, and flax, and pitch, and brush. <V 3:47>And the flame streamed forth above the furnace for forty-nine cubits. <V 3:48>And the fire erupted and burnt those of the Chaldeans within its reach near the furnace. <V 3:49>But the angel of the Lord descended with Azariah and his companions into the furnace; and he cast the flame of the fire out of the furnace. <V 3:50>And he made the middle of the furnace like the blowing of a damp wind, and the fire did not touch them, nor afflict them, nor bother them at all. <V 3:51>Then these three, as if with one voice, praised and glorified and blessed God, in the furnace, saying: <V 3:52>&#8220;Blessed are you, Lord, God of our fathers:  praiseworthy, and glorious, and exalted above all forever. And blessed is the holy name of your glory:  praiseworthy, and exalted above all, for all ages. <V 3:53>Blessed are you in the holy temple of your glory:  praiseworthy above all and exalted above all forever. <V 3:54>Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom:  praiseworthy above all and exalted above all forever. <V 3:55>Blessed are you who beholds the abyss and sits upon the cherubims:  praiseworthy and exalted above all forever. <V 3:56>Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven:  praiseworthy and glorious forever. <V 3:57>All works of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:58>Angels of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:59>Heaven, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:60>All waters that are above the heavens, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:61>All powers of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:62>Sun and moon, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:63>Stars of heaven, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:64>Every rain and dew, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:65>Every breath of God, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:66>Fire and steam, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:67>Cold and heat, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:68>Dews and frost, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:69>Sleet and winter, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:70>Ice and snow, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:71>Nights and days, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:72>Light and darkness, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:73>Lightning and clouds, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:74>May the land bless the Lord:  and praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:75>Mountains and hills, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:76>All things that grow in the land, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:77>Fountains, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:78>Seas and rivers, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:79>Whales and all things that move in the waters, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:80>All things that fly in the heavens, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:81>All beasts and cattle, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:82>Sons of men, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:83>May Israel bless the Lord:  and praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:84>Priests of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:85>Servants of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:86>Spirits and souls of the just, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:87>Those who are holy and humble in heart, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever. <V 3:88>Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all forever.

These names reflect the Babylonian culture and religion, as they were likely derived from names of Babylonian gods. The three men were Jewish exiles in Babylon, serving in the royal court after being selected for their wisdom and aptitude. Their story is a testament to their unwavering faith in the God of Israel, even in the face of severe persecution. This account highlights the theme of faithfulness under trial, a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in the lives of Joseph, Esther, and the apostles.<p><b>firmly bound</b><br>The phrase "firmly bound" indicates that the men were tied up securely, emphasizing the severity of their punishment and the intent to ensure they could not escape. This detail underscores the miraculous nature of their deliverance, as they were unharmed despite being bound. The binding can be seen as a symbol of the oppression and persecution faced by God's people, yet it also foreshadows their liberation and God's power to deliver. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to stand firm in their faith despite trials (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>).<p><b>fell into the blazing fiery furnace</b><br>The furnace was likely a large industrial kiln used for smelting metals or baking bricks, common in ancient Mesopotamia. The intense heat of the furnace, described as "blazing," signifies the extreme danger and the miraculous nature of their survival. The act of falling into the furnace suggests a sense of helplessness and total reliance on divine intervention. This event prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who saves believers from the "fiery furnace" of sin and judgment. The fiery trial also parallels the refining process of faith mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, where believers are purified and strengthened through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shadrach,_meshach,_and_abednego.htm">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</a></b><br>These are the three Jewish men who were taken into Babylonian captivity and served in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar.

Yet every detail sets the stage for God to showcase His supremacy: the counted men, their unwavering identities, the restrictive ropes, the helpless fall, and the raging flames all highlight that deliverance is entirely the Lord&#8217;s doing.
