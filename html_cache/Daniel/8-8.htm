Historically, Alexander's conquests rapidly expanded Greek influence across the known world, fulfilling the prophecy of the goat's greatness. The imagery of the goat aligns with the swift and powerful nature of Alexander's military campaigns, which reshaped the ancient world.<p><b>but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off</b><br>The "large horn" represents Alexander the Great himself. At the peak of his conquests, Alexander died suddenly in 323 BC at the age of 32, which is symbolized by the horn being "broken off." This abrupt end to his reign left a power vacuum and marked a significant turning point in history, as his empire was left without a strong leader.<p><b>and four prominent horns came up in its place</b><br>After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his four generals: Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy. These generals, often referred to as the Diadochi, established their own kingdoms, which are symbolized by the "four prominent horns." This division of the empire fulfilled the prophecy and set the stage for future conflicts and developments in the Hellenistic world.<p><b>pointing toward the four winds of heaven</b><br>The phrase "four winds of heaven" indicates the geographical spread of the four kingdoms that emerged from Alexander's empire. Each general took control of a different region, spreading out in various directions: Cassander in Macedonia and Greece, Lysimachus in Thrace and Asia Minor, Seleucus in the Near East, and Ptolemy in Egypt.

The phrase &#8220;became very great&#8221; captures the rapid expansion and overwhelming dominance of Greece under Alexander (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>).

The prophecy parallels <a href="/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>: &#8220;he will be broken off, but not in his own time&#8221;, underscoring God&#8217;s sovereignty over seemingly invincible rulers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and four prominent horns came up in its place</b><p>Out of the shattered empire arose four major successors, often called the Diadochi:<p>&#8226; Cassander over Macedonia and Greece<p>&#8226; Lysimachus over Thrace and Asia Minor<p>&#8226; Seleucus over Syria and the East<p>&#8226; Ptolemy over Egypt<p><a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a> confirms, &#8220;the four kingdoms that arise from this nation will not have the same power.&#8221; Their prominence was real but lesser than Alexander&#8217;s single &#8220;horn.&#8221; <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> had already pointed to a fourfold division, showing the consistency of the vision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>pointing toward the four winds of heaven</b><p>The new horns face every direction&#8212;north, south, east, and west&#8212;signifying the empire&#8217;s spread to the &#8220;four winds&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>).

The empire of Alexander had reached its greatest extent when the young conqueror fell a victim to what seems malarial fever, aggravated by his drinking. His life was broken off before its legitimate conclusion. At his death there was great confusion. Perdiccas assumed the guardianship of the children of the conqueror, and attempted to succeed him in the empire. After his death Antigonus in turn attempted to secure the imperial power, but was defeated and slain at the battle of Ipsus. The empire of Alexander was then divided into four main portions - Macedonia and Greece, under Cassander; Asia Minor, under Lysimachus; Syria and all the East, under Seleucus; and Cyrene, under Ptolemy. In the two first of these there were several revolutions, but finally the Antigonids established themselves in Macedon, and the Attalids in Asia Minor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus the goat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
