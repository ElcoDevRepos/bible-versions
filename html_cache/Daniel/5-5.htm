In biblical literature, the hand often symbolizes power and authority. This manifestation serves as a visible sign of God's judgment, reminiscent of other divine interventions, such as the plagues in Egypt.<p><b>and wrote on the plaster of the wall</b><br>Writing on the wall signifies a message from God, often associated with judgment or revelation.

The royal palace setting underscores the message's importance, as it is directed at the heart of Babylonian power and authority.<p><b>As the king watched the hand that was writing</b><br>King Belshazzar's direct observation of the event emphasizes his accountability.

Observe that it was only a portion of the hand that the king saw (comp. <a href="/daniel/5-24.htm" title="Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.">Daniel 5:24</a>), and that we are not told whether the guests saw the hand or not.

The two versions given in the Septuagint here do not seriously differ from each other or from the Massoretic text, only that they both omit "the part of," and represent the king as seeing the hand. Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, which maybe rendered "finger-joints;" otherwise this version is very like both the Massoretic and the LXX. The Peshitta presents no point of remark. The word translated "lamp" (<span class="accented">nebhrashta</span>) became in Talmudic times the equivalent of <span class="accented">menoorah</span>, "the golden candlestick." From this it has been supposed that "the candlestick" was the golden candlestick which later proved the crowining glory of Titus's triumph, and is still to be seen carved on his arch. When the other vessels of the house of the Lord were brought to deck the table of the monarch, it would not be unnatural that the golden candlestick should also be brought. In the great hall in which a thousand guests were accommodated, more lamps than one would be required. The Septuagint (text) adds, "over against the king:" this would individualize the lamp referred to; but there does not seem to be any support for this reading, which may be due to the desire to explain the <span class="accented">satatus emphaticus.</span> Gesenius derives the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, "<span class="accented">light</span>," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;</span>, "flame." As <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> as a consonant was unused in Assyrian, this derivation is by no means impossible We know that the Ninevite monarchs surrounded the great halls of their palaces with <span class="accented">bas-reliefs</span> of their victories. The remains of Babylon have not given us anything like the gypsum slabs of Kouyounjik. Yet the Babylonian monarchs not unlikely followed the same praetices as those of Nineveh. The walls were built and plastered, and then the slabs were moved up to them. In the case of Belshazzar, the palace walls might well be fresh; no gypsum slabs had yet recorded his prowess. As he looks to the white plaster, the fingers of a hand come out of the darkness, and write opposite him. "The king," thus it is in the Massoretic text, saw the "part" of the hand that wrote. <span class="accented">Pas</span> is the word. Furst renders it "wrist;" Gesenius, "the extremity;" Winer, <span class="accented">vola manus</span>," the hollow of the baud;" with this Buxtorf agrees. The balance of meanings seems to be in favour of "hollow of the hand," only it is difficult to understand the position of the hand relatively to the king when he saw the hollow of the hand. The smoke from the numerous lamps would obscure the roof of the hall of the palace; however numerous the lamps, their light would be unable to pierce the darkness, so out of the darkness came the hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(bah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
