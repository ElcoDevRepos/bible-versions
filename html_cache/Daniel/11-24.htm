Historically, this could refer to a time when nations are not expecting conflict, making them vulnerable. Biblically, peace can be deceptive, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where sudden destruction comes upon those who say "peace and safety."<p><b>he will invade the richest provinces</b><br>The "richest provinces" indicates areas of wealth and prosperity. This could be a reference to regions known for their resources or economic power. In the context of Daniel, this might allude to the Seleucid Empire's expansion under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who sought to exploit wealthy territories. Theologically, it reflects the human tendency to covet and seize material wealth, contrasting with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven.<p><b>and do what his fathers and forefathers never did</b><br>This phrase highlights unprecedented actions, suggesting a break from tradition or previous strategies. Historically, this could indicate a new level of aggression or cunning not seen in prior generations. It underscores the idea of escalating ambition and innovation in warfare or governance, reminiscent of the "new thing" God promises in <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, though in a negative context here.<p><b>He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers</b><br>This action of distributing wealth to followers is a tactic to secure loyalty and support. It reflects a political strategy of rewarding those who support one's regime, similar to how ancient kings would distribute spoils to their soldiers. This can be contrasted with the spiritual rewards promised by Christ to His followers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>.<p><b>and he will plot against the strongholds</b><br>Plotting against strongholds indicates strategic planning to overcome fortified places or centers of power. This could symbolize both literal military campaigns and metaphorical attacks on established institutions or beliefs. In a spiritual sense, it parallels the devil's schemes against the strongholds of faith, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-12</a>.<p><b>but only for a time</b><br>This phrase suggests a limitation on the success or duration of these actions. It implies that the power and influence of this figure are temporary, aligning with the biblical theme that earthly power is fleeting. This is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven, and in the ultimate triumph of God's eternal kingdom as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Antiochus IV Epiphanes)</a></b><br>This verse is often interpreted as referring to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his cunning and deceitful tactics.

According to another interpretation, the meaning is that he will scatter or disperse the accumulated wealth of the different provinces "among them"--that is, to their hurt. The former explanation appears to be most in accordance with the deceit and craft which the prophecy attributes to the king.<p><span class= "bld">For a time</span>.--That is, the end of the time decreed by God. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm" title="And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.">Daniel 8:19</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm" title="But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.">Daniel 12:4</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?">Daniel 12:6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is," Suddenly he shall desolate the city, and he shall do such things as his fathers have not done, nor his father's fathers, and he shall give captives (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/21.htm">Deuteronomy 21</a>.)and spoils and riches to them; and against the strong city a device shall be forecast (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and his reasonings are in vain." In the first clause, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> seems to have been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="accented">Medeena</span> is taken in its Syriac meaning. It is difficult to see what reading could produce both the Massoretic and the Septuagint renderings. Theodotion differs alike from this and from the Massoretic, "And in plenty, and in the fat places he shall corn and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; and he shall disperse among them captives (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and spoil and <span class="accented">possessions</span>, and against (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span>) Egypt he shall devise devices, even for a season." The Peshitta is like the Massoretic. It joins what is reckoned the last clause of ver. 23 to the present verse, and omits "peaceably;" the last words of this verse are transferred to the next. The Vulgate is more related to Theodotion than to the Massoretic text, "And he shall enter plenteous (<span class="accented">abundantes</span>) and rich <span class="accented">cities."</span> The remaining part of the verse agrees with the Massoretic text The events here indicated are somewhat difficult to identify. The histories of this period are scanty, and, with the exception of Polybius, whose work has come to us in a fragmentary condition, not very trustworthy. Moreover, the readings are uncertain in a portion of the verse. It is generally held to describe the first entrance of Epiphanes into Palestine or Egypt - more generally the latter - an opinion shared by Theodotion. The English versions do not bring out the probable meaning, although their rendering agrees with the Massoretic pointing, "That which his fathers have not done," etc. The repeated triumphant invasions of Egypt are probably referred to. <span class="accented">Forecast devices against the strong holds.</span> This may refer to the siege of Alexandria, which he was on the eve of commencing when he was compelled by the Roman envoy, Popilius Lena, to desist; but this is evidently the subject of the later verse. We can most easily understand this verse if we regard it as a summary of the whole reign of Antiochus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In a time of peace,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
