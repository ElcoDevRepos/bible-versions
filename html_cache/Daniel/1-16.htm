The "choice food" refers to the royal diet from King Nebuchadnezzar's table, which included meats and wines. This diet was considered luxurious and was meant to prepare the young men for service in the Babylonian court. The withholding of this food was a result of Daniel's request to avoid defiling himself with food that may have been offered to idols or not prepared according to Jewish dietary laws (Leviticus 11). This act of withholding demonstrates the steward's compliance with Daniel's faith-based decision, highlighting the favor Daniel found in the eyes of his overseers (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>).<p><b>and the wine they were to drink</b><br>Wine in ancient Babylon was a common part of the diet, often used in religious rituals and feasts. Daniel's abstention from the wine, like the food, was likely due to its association with idolatrous practices. This decision reflects a commitment to maintain purity and obedience to God's laws, even in a foreign land. The refusal of wine also prefigures the Nazarite vow, which included abstaining from wine (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>), and can be seen as a type of Christ, who also abstained from worldly indulgences to fulfill His mission (<a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>).<p><b>and he gave them vegetables instead</b><br>The term "vegetables" here can be understood broadly to include grains, legumes, and other plant-based foods. This diet aligns with the Jewish practice of eating foods that are clean and not associated with pagan rituals. The success of Daniel and his friends on this diet (<a href="/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a>) serves as a testament to God's provision and blessing. It also echoes the dietary laws given to Israel, emphasizing reliance on God rather than the opulence of Babylon. This choice of diet can be seen as a precursor to the spiritual discipline and fasting that Jesus practiced and taught (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man of noble lineage taken into Babylonian captivity.

The official put in charge of Daniel and his friends does not make a one-time concession; he keeps it up day after day. God had already &#8220;granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief official&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>), echoing the way He gave Joseph favor with Potiphar (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>). When &#8220;a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies live at peace with him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>). Daniel&#8217;s faithfulness produces a ripple effect of obedience around him, reminding us that genuine conviction has staying power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to withhold their choice food</b><p>The steward &#8220;continued to withhold their choice food.&#8221; The &#8220;choice food&#8221; was the royal fare, likely the richest meats and delicacies from the king&#8217;s table. For Daniel, accepting it meant compromise&#8212;possibly ceremonial defilement (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>) or overt identification with Babylon&#8217;s pagan way of life. By abstaining, he models <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>&#8212;refusing to be conformed to the pattern of this world. Notice how the text stresses the steward&#8217;s active role: he kept withholding. Daniel&#8217;s quiet resolve enabled someone else to act righteously, illustrating how godly courage can fortify others (<a href="/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the wine they were to drink</b><p>Next, the verse singles out &#8220;the wine they were to drink.&#8221; Wine itself is not forbidden in Scripture, yet Daniel voluntarily lays it aside. His choice parallels the Nazarite vow of <a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a> and the caution that &#8220;Wine is a mocker&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). Refusing the king&#8217;s wine protects him from assimilation, from dulled discernment (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>), and from any appearance of endorsement of Babylon&#8217;s idols (<a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15&#8211;16</a>). It also anticipates Paul&#8217;s exhortation: &#8220;It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he gave them vegetables instead</b><p>Finally, &#8220;he gave them vegetables instead.&#8221; The steward substitutes simple fare&#8212;seeds, legumes, and plants. Verse 15 reports the surprising result: &#8220;they looked healthier and better nourished.&#8221; God honors their faith with physical vigor, illustrating <a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>, &#8220;Those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.&#8221;<p>Lessons that spring from this closing phrase:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s provision can come through humble means.<p>&#8226; Obedience sometimes looks ordinary&#8212;just eating differently&#8212;but it yields extraordinary impact.<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small decisions readies us for larger tests (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; What the world calls scant, God can call sufficient (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>The text never praises the vegetables; it praises the God who blesses obedience (<a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/1-16.htm">Daniel 1:16</a> shows steady, practical obedience. Because Daniel stood firm, the steward kept withholding the royal delicacies and wine, supplying vegetables instead. God turned a private dietary decision into a public display of His faithfulness, proving that those who honor Him, He will honor in return (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Thus Melzar took away the portion of their moat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. The Massoretic has the article here before "Melzar" - a fact that the Authorized does not indicate; the Revised renders more correctly, "the steward." The version of the Septuagint does not differ much from the Massoretic, only the word translated "that they should drink" is omitted; on the other hand, we have the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) put in composition with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), "gave them instead," as if, in the text before the translator, the <span class="accented">mem</span>, which begins <span class="accented">mishtayhem</span>, had been put to the end of <span class="accented">yayin</span>, "wine," making it "their wine" - a construction which would be more symmetrical than the present. Only it is difficult to see how either <span class="accented">tahath asher</span> could be changed into <span class="accented">shtayhem</span>, or vice <span class="accented">versa.</span> The Septuagint translation suggests a simpler and more natural text - not a simplified one - therefore it is, on the whole, to be preferred. The careful word-for-word translation of the beginning of the verse renders it little likely that the translator would paraphrase at the end; c g. the word translated in our version "thus" is really <span class="accented">veeay'he</span>, "it was," and in the LXX. this is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, "it was." Theodotion is in absolute agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta calls the steward <span class="accented">ma</span>-<span class="accented">nitzor</span>, and renders the last clause, "<span class="accented">and</span> he gave to them seeds to eat, and water to drink," evidently borrowed from the twelfth verse. The result of the success of the experiment is that the youths are no more importuned to partake of the king's dainties. The steward, or the attendant who looked after their <span class="accented">mess</span>, supplied them with pulse. It has occurred to two commentators, widely separated from each other in point of time, that the consent of the "Melzar ' was all the more easily gained, that he could utilize the abstemiousness of these Hebrew youths to his own private advantage. Both Jephet-ibn-Ali in the beginning of the eleventh century, and Ewald in the middle of the nineteenth, maintain that the "Melzar' used to his own purposes, possibly sold, the portion of food and wine that the Hebrew youths abjured. Certainly the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> means the lifting and carrying away, and suggests that every day the portions of food and wine were first carried to the table of these Hebrews, and then, after having been placed before them, were removed and pulse brought instead. When we think of it, some such process would have to take place. If it had been observed that one table was never supplied with a portion from the king's table, there might have been remarks made, and the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> would have fallen into disgrace with his sovereign, and the Hebrew youths would possibly have shared his disgrace. As to how the portions thus retained were disposed of, we need not be curious; there would, no doubt, be plenty of claimants for the broken victuals from the King of Babylon's table, without accusing the "Melzar" of dishonest motives. The fact that the verbs are in participle implies that henceforth it was the regular habit of the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> to remove from before the tour friends the royal dainties, and supply them instead with pulse. We have already referred to the word used for "<span class="accented">pulse</span>; ' it is here <span class="accented">zayroneem</span>, whereas in the twelfth verse it is <span class="accented">zayroeem.</span> Not impossibly in the verse before us we have another case of the original Aramaic shining through the translation; in the Peshitta the word is <span class="accented">zer'oona</span>, Whatever the word was, it seems certain that originally it was the same in both places, as in none of the versions is there any variation. It is not so impossible that originally the vocalization was different, and that the word was the ordinary word <span class="accented">zer'aim</span>, "seeds." This certainly is the translation of Theodotion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
