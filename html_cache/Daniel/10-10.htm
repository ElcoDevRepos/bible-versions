In the context of Daniel's vision, the touch signifies a moment of divine communication and reassurance. The hand likely belongs to an angelic being, as seen in other biblical accounts where angels interact with humans (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>, <a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11-13</a>). The suddenness emphasizes the immediacy and urgency of the message being delivered to Daniel.<p><b>and set me trembling</b><br>The trembling reflects Daniel's human reaction to the divine presence, a common response in biblical narratives when encountering the supernatural (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). This physical reaction underscores the awe and fear associated with encountering God's messengers. It also highlights Daniel's humility and reverence, qualities that are consistent with his character throughout the book.<p><b>on my hands and knees</b><br>This posture indicates a position of submission and vulnerability. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bowing or kneeling was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of authority. Daniel's position here is symbolic of his readiness to receive divine revelation. It also parallels other biblical instances where individuals fall prostrate before God or His messengers (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). This posture prepares Daniel to receive the message that follows, emphasizing his role as a prophet and servant of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is in a state of mourning and prayer, seeking understanding of a vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand.htm">The Hand</a></b><br>Represents divine intervention, possibly an angelic being sent by God to strengthen and communicate with Daniel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/trembling.htm">Trembling</a></b><br>Indicates Daniel's human frailty and awe in the presence of a divine messenger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The setting of Daniel's vision, where he is in exile and serving under the Persian rule.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>The context of this chapter is a vision concerning a great conflict, which Daniel is trying to comprehend.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_encouragement.htm">Divine Encouragement</a></b><br>God provides strength and encouragement to His servants in times of need.

The verse assures believers that when divine purpose intersects human weakness, God&#8217;s touch both unsettles and upholds, preparing His servants to hear and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">An hand.--</span>This hand was that of the person who appeared, but it is spoken of as "felt," not as seen. But though supported by this hand, the prophet is unable to stand upright. He crouches in a terrified posture. It should be noticed that the equivalent of "set" is translated "scatter" (<a href="/psalms/59-11.htm" title="Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by your power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.">Psalm 59:11</a> [12]). It is used in the same sense in the passage before us. (See <a href="/amos/9-9.htm" title="For, see, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall on the earth.">Amos 9:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</span> The LXX. agrees with this, but does not bring out any more than this the pregnant sense of the Hebrew. This is given in the margin of the Revised, "Set me tottering on my knees," etc. Strangely enough, the LXX. renders, "soles of my feet " - an impossible attitude; that this is the true reading of the LXX. is confirmed by Paulus Telleusis. Theodotion omits "the palms of the hands." The Peshitta renders as the LXX. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> by <span class="accented">articulos</span>, "joints." <span class="accented">An hand touched me</span>. The hand of him that appeared to him - though Daniel does not say. It is needless to multiply angelic agencies. A discussion has been raised on the question whether this is Gabriel who appeared to Daniel in the eighth chapter, or Michael, or the angel of the presence. It is not a matter of importance, but Michael is excluded by ver. 13, and also, to our thinking, "the angel of the presence," if by that title the Second Person of the Trinity is indicated. <span class="accented">Which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</span> Although the touch communicated to Daniel some strength, yet he was unable to raise himself so as to look up - his face was still to the ground, his attitude was still one of abasement, and he was trembling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Suddenly,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">touched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1490;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5060.htm">Strong's 5060: </a> </span><span class="str2">To touch, lay the hand upon, to reach, violently, to strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">and set me trembling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5128.htm">Strong's 5128: </a> </span><span class="str2">To quiver, wave, waver, tremble, totter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my hands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;ap&#183;p&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3709.htm">Strong's 3709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hollow or flat of the hand, palm, sole (of the foot), a pan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and knees.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(bir&#183;kay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1290.htm">Strong's 1290: </a> </span><span class="str2">The knee</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/10-10.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 10:10 Behold a hand touched me which set (Dan.
