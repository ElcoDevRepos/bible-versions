The "mighty men of valor" were likely elite soldiers, indicating the importance and urgency of the task. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such men were highly trained and respected, often used for critical missions. This reflects the king's determination to enforce his decree and the perceived threat posed by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego's defiance.<p><b>to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b><br>The act of tying up these men symbolizes their complete submission to the king's authority, at least in a physical sense. It also emphasizes their helplessness and the apparent finality of their situation. The names Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are Babylonian names given to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, respectively, reflecting their forced assimilation into Babylonian culture. Their refusal to worship the golden image, however, shows their steadfast faith in the God of Israel, reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood firm in their beliefs despite persecution.<p><b>and throw them into the blazing fiery furnace</b><br>The fiery furnace was likely a large industrial kiln used for smelting metals or baking bricks, common in Babylonian construction. The intense heat symbolizes the severity of the punishment for defying the king's decree. Fire in the Bible often represents judgment or purification, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. The furnace also serves as a type of trial by fire, a test of faith that foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and protection by God. This event prefigures the trials faced by believers and the promise of divine presence and deliverance, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus' assurance of being with His followers in times of trouble (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who erected a golden statue and commanded all to worship it.

What appears as absolute control by a pagan king is, in truth, another opportunity for the living God to display His unmatched sovereignty and faithfulness to those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The most mighty men.--</span>He selected these as being the most likely to be able to bear the unusual heat of the fire. Whether he had any expectation that some attempt at a rescue would be made does not appear. We may gather, however, that the army was present at this horrible tragedy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind</span> <span class="cmt_word">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> The first clause might more correctly be rendered, "He commanded warriors, warriors of might, in his army." The Greek versions assume that the repetition of <span class="accented">gubereen is</span> equivalent to the superlative; hence the LXX. renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b9;&#x27;</span>. The Peshitta omits the first <span class="accented">gubreen.</span> On the other hand, Theodotiun omits the clause, "that were in his army." The action of Nebuchadnezzar in this reveals one of the contradictions so often manifested by polytheism. He might be ready to admit that no accumulation of human power could equal Divine power, yet it is obvious that these men of might were chosen for this purpose, in order that, despite Divine power, the royal sentence might be carried out. Such self-contradiction is not peculiar to Nebuchadnezzar nor to Babylon. Many men, professing to be Christians and acknowledging that God sees and knows all things, and that the wrath of God is an infinitely more serious mattter than the contempt or "ill will" of men, yet commit sin secretly - to hide it from God. Hitzig indicates that he thinks these not to have been the ordinary body-guard of the king, but really the best troops in the province where the festival was taking place. It is evident that the troops referred to are not those <span class="accented">tabbaheen</span> of whom Arioch was the commander, otherwise we might have expected them to be mentioned. We know that there were different classes of soldiers in the Assyrian army, with differing kinds of arms and armour. In all probability something similar prevailed in the Babylonian army. It is not impossible that one corps might be specialized as the men of greatest physical strength. These men are employed to bind these three Jews to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_560.htm">Strong's 560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, tell, command</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mighty warriors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gib&#183;b&#257;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1401.htm">Strong's 1401: </a> </span><span class="str2">Valiant, warrior</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;ay&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
