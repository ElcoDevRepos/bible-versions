This timing is significant as it follows the Passover, a key Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. The 24th day suggests that Daniel had been in a period of mourning and fasting, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, which aligns with the traditional period of Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This context highlights Daniel's devotion and the spiritual preparation for the vision he is about to receive.<p><b>as I was standing on the bank of the great river</b><br>The mention of standing on the bank indicates a position of waiting or expectation. Rivers in biblical times were often places of significant events and revelations. The imagery of standing by a river can symbolize a threshold or a place of transition, suggesting that Daniel is on the verge of receiving a divine message. This setting also emphasizes the solemnity and importance of the vision.<p><b>the Tigris</b><br>The Tigris River is one of the two major rivers in Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. This region, known as the cradle of civilization, was a center of ancient empires, including Babylon and Persia, where Daniel was in exile. The Tigris is mentioned in Genesis as one of the rivers flowing from Eden, linking it to the biblical narrative of creation. Its mention here situates Daniel's vision within a historical and geographical context that underscores the continuity of God's plan from creation through the history of Israel. The Tigris also represents the vastness and power of the empires of the time, against which God's sovereignty is demonstrated through the visions given to Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision.

The setting occurs three days after the week-long Feast of Unleavened Bread would have ended (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-18</a>), suggesting Daniel had continued fasting and mourning past the feast (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the first month</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;first month&#8221; is Nisan, the month of Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning Nisan, the text ties Daniel&#8217;s contemporary longing for deliverance with the historic Passover redemption, echoing how later exiles sought renewal in the same month (<a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God often unveils major revelations at divinely memorable times: Ezekiel sees visions &#8220;in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), reinforcing the idea that God&#8217;s timetable is deliberate and trustworthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as I was standing</b><p>&#8226;

Daniel&#8217;s earlier visions occurred near the Ulai Canal (<a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>); here, at the Tigris, the context hints at looming conflict affecting Persia and beyond (cf. <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20</a>).<p>&#8226;

Hiddekel is the Accadian name of the river. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/2-14.htm" title="And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.">Genesis 2:14</a>.) "Great river" is an epithet usually applied to the river Euphrates, as <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>. Daniel was here in the body, and not only in the spirit, as <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm" title="And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.">Daniel 8:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel</span>. The LXX. differs from this only in rendering Hiddekel by its Greek name "Tigris." Theodotion subjoins to Tigris <span class="accented">Eddekel</span>, on the same principle that we have on the margin of our Bibles different renderings from those in the text. The Peshitta makes the river the Euphrates. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint. There seems no reasonable doubt that Behrmann is right in regarding the <span class="accented">Phrat</span> of the Syriac as a gloss. It certainly was a natural suggestion, that, as Babylon was on the Euphrates, Daniel should rather be found walking there at the termination of his fast, than forty or fifty miles off. <span class="accented">The four and twentieth day of the first month</span>; that is, the month Nisan or Abib - the month in which the Passover was celebrated in every Jewish home. It would seem that Daniel did not join in this festival at this time. It is noted that, from the days of Saul, the two first days of every month were devoted to a feast, and hence, that Daniel's fast could only begin on the third day. Since-he mast have refrained from partaking of the Paschal lamb, we cannot deduce that he might not occupy the opening days of the month with sadness rather than feasting. If Daniel is an ideal figure, intended to represent the model Jew resident in a foreign land, why is he thus represented as not partaking of the Paschal feast? It is true that, with the temple in ruins, the Paschal lamb could not be slain in the way enjoined in the Law; but the modern Jew keeps the Passover without the lamb. <span class="accented">I was by the side of the great river</span>, <span class="accented">which is Hiddekel.</span> The name is a transference of the Assyrian name <span class="accented">Iddiklat.</span> It would seem that Daniel was then on the banks of the Tigris, not in vision, but in actual person, as here there is no reference, as in <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, to his being there in vision; the mention of attendants also renders it unlikely that it was only in vision that Daniel was on the banks of the Tigris. His purpose in being there was probably governmental, as he had attendants with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the twenty-fourth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
