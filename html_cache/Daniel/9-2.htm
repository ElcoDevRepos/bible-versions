This historical context is significant as it marks a transition of power and the fulfillment of earlier prophecies regarding the fall of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>). The timing is crucial as it sets the stage for the events and revelations that follow in the book of Daniel.<p><b>I, Daniel, understood from the sacred books</b><br>Daniel's reference to the "sacred books" indicates his study of the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly the writings of the prophets. This highlights the importance of Scripture in understanding God's plans and purposes. Daniel's diligent study serves as a model for believers to seek wisdom and understanding through the Word of God. It also underscores the continuity and reliability of biblical prophecy.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet</b><br>This phrase points to the specific prophecy given by God through Jeremiah regarding the duration of Jerusalem's desolation. <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12 and 29</a>:10 explicitly mention the seventy-year period of Babylonian captivity. Daniel's recognition of Jeremiah's prophecy as the word of the LORD affirms the authority and inspiration of the prophetic writings. It also demonstrates the interconnectedness of biblical prophecy and its fulfillment.<p><b>that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years</b><br>The seventy-year desolation of Jerusalem is a significant prophetic period that reflects God's judgment and mercy. This period began with the first deportation of Jews to Babylon in 605 BC and concluded with the decree of Cyrus allowing the Jews to return in 538 BC. Theologically, the seventy years symbolize a complete period of divine discipline, after which God would restore His people. This prophecy also foreshadows the ultimate restoration and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises of God to restore and renew His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian and Persian empires, known for his wisdom and faithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet whose writings Daniel studied, specifically regarding the prophecy of Jerusalem's desolation lasting seventy years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that was desolated and whose restoration was prophesied by Jeremiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were exiled in Babylon, which Daniel references in his understanding of the seventy years.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicated His plans through the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture_study.htm">The Importance of Scripture Study</a></b><br>Daniel's understanding came from diligent study of the Scriptures.

It will be observed that there existed at this time a collection of sacred books, consisting of what had been already admitted into the Canon.<p><span class= "bld">Seventy years.</span>--It appears from <a href="/haggai/1-2.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.">Haggai 1:2</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>, that considerable uncertainty prevailed as to the time whence the seventy years were to be reckoned. It has been pointed out (Professor Leathes' <span class= "ital">Old Testament Prophecy,</span> p. 179) that three periods of seventy years occur in connection with the Captivity:--(1) from B.C. 606, the date of Jeremiah's prophecy, to B.C. 536, the edict of Cyrus; (2) from B.C. 598, Jehoiachin's captivity, to B.C. 528, the period of <a href="/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>; (3) from B.C. 588, the destruction of the Temple, to <span class= "ital">B.C. 5</span>18, the edict of Darius (<a href="/ezra/6-1.htm" title="Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.">Ezra 6:1</a>). In the first year of Cyrus, seventy years had elapsed since the captivity of Daniel, but to him it was a question of melancholy importance whether his computation had begun at the right date. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">in the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
