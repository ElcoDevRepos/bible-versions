His reign is historically significant, marked by military conquests and extensive building projects, including the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. In the biblical narrative, Nebuchadnezzar is a central figure in the Book of Daniel, representing the height of human pride and power. His interactions with Daniel and the God of Israel highlight themes of divine sovereignty and human humility.<p><b>was at ease in my house</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of peace and prosperity for Nebuchadnezzar. Historically, this could refer to a time after his major military campaigns, when his empire was secure. The king's ease suggests a false sense of security, as the narrative will soon reveal his vulnerability to divine intervention. This mirrors the biblical theme that human power is temporary and subject to God's will.<p><b>and flourishing in my palace</b><br>The word "flourishing" suggests prosperity and success, both personally and for his kingdom. The palace, a symbol of his wealth and authority, reflects the grandeur of Babylon. This prosperity is reminiscent of the biblical warning against pride and self-reliance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." Nebuchadnezzar's flourishing is temporary, foreshadowing the humbling experience he will soon face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, known for his powerful reign and the construction of the Hanging Gardens.

Here, no doubt, it is suggested by the dream which follows, and is for that reason selected by Daniel. It may be observed that the LXX. version here, as in <a href="/daniel/3-1.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.">Daniel 3:1</a>, gives the eighteenth year as the date.<p><span class= "bld">My palace.</span>--See Layard's <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon,</span> p. 506.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</span> In the Aramaic text there is what may be regarded either as a play on words of the nature of rhyme, or the traces of a doublet. The Septuagint begins the chapter with this verse, as does the Massoretic text, but further appends a date, "In the eighteenth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar said, I was at peace in my house, and established upon my throne: I saw a vision, and I was awestruck, and fear fell upon me." Theodotion differs from this and also from the Massoretic text, and renders, "I Nebuchadnezzar was flourishing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) in my house, and was prospering (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." The similarity in sound between <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> may have had to do with the rendering. It will be noted that this is further from the Massoretic recension than the Septuagint. The Peshitta repeats the idea of rest, "I Nebuchadnezzar was at peace (<span class="accented">shala</span>) in my house, and was resting (<span class="accented">reeh</span>) in my palace." The Massoretic is supported by the Septuagint, and, therefore, strong. The date in the Septuagint, however, may be questioned. The eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar was that preceding the capture of Jerusalem, which, according to <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>, happened in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. In the twenty-ninth verse of the same chapter we have an account of the carrying away of prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar in his eighteenth year, in a passage omitted from the LXX., in a way that makes it probable that, if this passage be genuine, the one is according to the Jewish, the other according to the Babylonian mode of reckoning. If that is so, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar would mean the year of the capture of Jerusalem. If this date had, however, been correct, something about the coincidence would have been mentioned. Had this book been written to encourage the Jews in their conflict against Epiphanes, it would have been mentioned that Nebuchadnezzar's madness occurred after he had captured Jerusalem. At the same time, a later scribe would have a tendency to insert such a date, even if no date had been there, or at all events to modify any other date into this. Thus we find in the Septuagint ver. 15 (Massoretic 19, Authorized Version 24) a reference to the capture of Jerusalem. Another cause would tend to make "eighteenth year" liable to occur at this point, it is that the previous chapter in the Septuagint begins with assigning the same date. The change must have been made before the exemplar from which the Septuagint translator made his translation had bern transcribed, as it appears in Paulus Tellensis. Ewald has suggested "the twenty-eighth year" - in many respects a probable suggestion. As Ewald has pointed out, the proclamation would have a date. Even if, as Ewald maintained, it was the work of a later time than the days of Nebuchadnezzar, yet so skilful a writer could not fail to recognize the necessity. The Septuagint Version does not give the beginning of this narrative the form of a proclamation. The attitude of the king is that of rest after the toils of long wars - an attitude that could not be attributed to him when he had not reached the middle of his reign. The conquest of Egypt followed the capture of Jerusalem. The difference between "ten" and "twenty" in Aramaic, as in Hebrew, is comparatively little. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> ('<span class="accented">asar</span>) is "ten," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">asareen</span>) is "twenty." As the "ten" is the final word in the numerical statement, it would be modified <span class="accented">asaratha</span>, whereas the word "twenty" is frequently in similar circumstances unmodified; we should then have 'a<span class="accented">soreen.</span> It may have been even later, but if the real year had been "thirty-eighth," the modification of the words would require to be greater. Ewald's further consideration, that as "thirty-eighth" would only leave five years till the forty-three years of Nebuchadnezzar were completed, and therefore would not leave space for the seven years of madness, is of less force, as we are not obliged to take "times" as "years" in vers. 16 and 32. The king had received tokens of Divine power in his past history, and had in a sort acknowledged God but still he had not surrendered his pride. The idea that in this there is a reference to Epiphanes seems far-fetched. The only reason assigned by Hitzig and Behrmann is that the Antiochian mob nicknamed him <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. We have no reason to believe that this was a common nickname, even in Antioch, and there is not very much likelihood of the nickname spreading to Judaea. There is absolutely no evidence that Antiochus ever received the nickname "Epimanes." The passage appealed to is usually Polybius, 26:10, but in that passage there is nothing of the kind said. This portion of Polybius has come down to us only in quotation in Athenaeus' 'Deipnosophistae' - a collection of odds and ends, strung together by a dialogue. In this book, twice is this portion of Polybius quoted, and in introducing this quotation in beth cases the author refers to the nickname "Epimanes." In the one case, 5:21 (193), he says generally "Antiochus, surnamed (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) Epiphanes, but called (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">Epimanes</span>, for his deeds." So far as this goes, Antiochus may have been generally nicknamed Epimanes; but it is to be noted that this is not said, and Polybius is not given as the authority. In the other passage the aspect of things is changed. In 10:53 (439) Athenaeus gives the reference to the book of Polybius, and says, speaking of Antiochus, "Polybius calls him Epimanes on account of his deeds." Here Athenaeus says that Polybius himself called Antiochus Epimanes, not that anybody else did so. He does not say that Polybius says that Antiochus "was called Epimanes," but that "Polybius calls him (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>)." He further gives no indication where Polybius says this. As there is no evidence for the nickname, there is no evidence that this incident was invented to suit this non-existent nickname. The picture of Nebuchadnezzar at rest in his palace is as unlike as possible the uneasy restless demeanour of Antiochus, staggering through the streets more or less drunk, joining with any brawlers he might come in contact with. If the writer of Daniel got the story of the madness from the nickname, he would not fail to get an account of the habits of the monarch, which led to the nickname being given. If he intended his picture of Nebuehadnezzar resting in his palace after his victorious career, with all the dignity of an Oriental monarch, to be recognized as a portrait of Antiochus roaming the streets with a set of drunken companions, the author of Daniel must have had singular ideas of portraiture. It would require a madness greater then Nebuchadnezzar's to believe it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_576.htm">Strong's 576: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;w&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become, come to pass, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at ease</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7954.htm">Strong's 7954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be secure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1005.htm">Strong's 1005: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and flourishing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ra&#8216;&#183;nan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7487.htm">Strong's 7487: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or grow luxuriant, fresh, or green</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my palace.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1965.htm">Strong's 1965: </a> </span><span class="str2">A large public building, palace, temple</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/4-4.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 4:4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my (Dan.
