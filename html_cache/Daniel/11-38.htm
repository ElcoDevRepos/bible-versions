The "god of fortresses" symbolizes reliance on military strength and fortifications rather than spiritual or divine guidance. Historically, this reflects the Hellenistic period's emphasis on military conquest and defense. Theologically, it contrasts with the biblical teaching that true security comes from God, not human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>a god his fathers did not know</b><br>This indicates the introduction of a new form of worship or deity that was unfamiliar to the king's ancestors. It suggests a departure from traditional religious practices, possibly reflecting the influence of Greek culture and religion during the time of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who is often associated with this prophecy. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of idolatry and the dangers of forsaking the worship of the true God (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>).<p><b>with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches</b><br>The use of wealth to honor this new god highlights the materialistic and idolatrous nature of the king's worship. It reflects the historical context of rulers who amassed wealth to display power and secure loyalty. Biblically, this can be seen as a critique of valuing material wealth over spiritual devotion, echoing warnings against idolatry and the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The lavish offerings also underscore the futility of trusting in riches rather than God (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This refers to a future ruler who will act contrary to the traditions of his ancestors, honoring a new deity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_fortresses.htm">God of Fortresses</a></b><br>A deity symbolizing military power and strength, which the king will worship with wealth and treasures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancestors.htm">Ancestors</a></b><br>The forefathers of the king, who did not know or worship this god of fortresses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold,_silver,_precious_stones,_and_riches.htm">Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, and Riches</a></b><br>These represent the material wealth used to honor the god of fortresses, indicating a focus on materialism and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_time_of_the_end.htm">The Time of the End</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> is a prophecy concerning the end times, involving conflicts and the rise of powerful leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_of_power_and_wealth.htm">Idolatry of Power and Wealth</a></b><br>The passage warns against the idolatry of power and wealth, reminding believers to prioritize God above material possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to discern the values and priorities of leaders, ensuring they align with biblical principles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>Despite cultural or societal pressures, believers are called to remain faithful to the God of their fathers, rejecting false gods.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/end_times_awareness.htm">End Times Awareness</a></b><br>Understanding the prophetic context of <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> helps Christians remain vigilant and prepared for the challenges of the end times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/materialism's_danger.htm">Materialism's Danger</a></b><br>The king's actions serve as a caution against the dangers of materialism and the pursuit of wealth at the expense of spiritual integrity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_11_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 11:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_38_Idolatry_s_modern_risks.htm">How does Daniel 11:38 illustrate the dangers of idolatry in today's society?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Misplaced_priorities_in_worship.htm">What does "honor a god of fortresses" reveal about misplaced priorities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_God_our_priority.htm">How can we ensure God remains our priority, unlike in Daniel 11:38?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Dan_11_38_Exo_20_3_message.htm">Compare Daniel 11:38 with Exodus 20:3.

In other words, having rejected every previous authority, he now installs something entirely different. Scripture repeatedly shows such a shift whenever leaders discard truth (<a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>). Daniel had already seen rulers &#8220;intend to change times and law&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>), and the apostle Paul foresees the &#8220;man of lawlessness&#8221; who &#8220;sets himself up in God&#8217;s temple&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>). History and prophecy agree: when truth is pushed aside, a vacuum is created&#8212;and it never stays empty for long.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will honor</b><p>The text continues, &#8220;&#8230;he will honor&#8230;.&#8221; Honor here is more than polite respect; it is worship, allegiance, and passionate promotion. <a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a> describes the world marveling and worshiping the beast, crying, &#8220;Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?&#8221; The Antichrist exalts this newfound deity publicly and persistently, just as Nebuchadnezzar once forced all peoples to bow to his golden image (<a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4-6</a>). Honor, then, means he will:<p>&#8226; Celebrate this god&#8217;s supremacy.<p>&#8226; Demand acknowledgment from others.<p>&#8226; Structure his kingdom around its ideals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a god of fortresses</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;a god of fortresses&#8230;.&#8221; Rather than trusting the LORD who calls Himself our refuge and strength (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>), this ruler puts his confidence in military power, strongholds, and weaponry. <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> portrays a similar mindset: &#8220;Then they sweep by like the wind and pass on&#8212;yet they are guilty; their strength is their god.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7-8</a> confirms that global power and warfare characterize the beast&#8217;s reign. For a short season, the world will worship might as right, believing military dominance guarantees peace. Yet <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a god his fathers did not know</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;a god his fathers did not know&#8230;.&#8221; The novelty is deliberate. By choosing a deity unfamiliar to previous generations, the ruler breaks every remaining tie to historical faith or tradition. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> warned Israel about sacrificing &#8220;to demons they had not known, to gods newly arrived, which your fathers did not fear.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a> depicts the beast as something the world has &#8220;never seen.&#8221; Novelty often masquerades as progress, but Scripture clarifies that any departure from the true God is regression into darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches</b><p>Finally, &#8220;&#8230;with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches.&#8221; Lavish wealth fuels the cult. <a href="/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12-13</a> lists similar treasures driving the last-days economy, and <a href="/ezekiel/28-4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a> links luxury with prideful rebellion. By pouring money into this false worship, the ruler:<p>&#8226; Makes idolatry look irresistible and sophisticated.<p>&#8226; Incentivizes loyalty&#8212;follow him, and the riches flow.<p>&#8226; Displays apparent invincibility, persuading nations that siding against him would be foolish.<p>Jesus&#8217; warning rings true: &#8220;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>). The Antichrist&#8217;s heart is fixed on treasure, and treasure is used to fix the world&#8217;s heart on him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-38.htm">Daniel 11:38</a> portrays a future ruler who, after rejecting every former allegiance, builds his empire on worship of militarized power. He elevates this &#8220;god of fortresses&#8221; with fervent honor, unprecedented novelty, and extravagant wealth. Cross-scriptural echoes&#8212;from Habakkuk to Revelation&#8212;confirm that humanity&#8217;s final rebellion will hinge on trusting might, riches, and self-exaltation rather than the living God. The faithful, therefore, are called to cling to the true Fortress, Jesus Christ, refusing the glitter of impostors and the intimidation of earthly power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But in</span> <span class="cmt_word">his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stores, and pleasant things.</span> As we have said above, the last clause of the preceding verse according to the LXX. really belongs to this, "Strong nations shall be subject to him," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. There is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> in the Massoretic, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> has been in the reading followed by the Septuagint. After this clause the Septuagint proceeds, "And to his place he shall move, and a god whom his fathers knew not he shall honour with gold, and silver, and precious stones." It is possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">nadad</span>)," to flee or move," was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">kabad</span>)," to honour;" for though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is usually active and transitive, there is no object here. Theodotion has, "And the God of Maozeim he shall honour in his place, and a god whom his father knew not he shall honour with gold, silver, and precious stones, and with offerings." The Peshitta rendering is freer, "The mighty god he shall honour in his possession, and a god whom his fathers have not known shall he honour with gold and with silver, with precious gems and desirable things." The Vulgate adopts the transliteration <span class="accented">Maozim. In his estate shall he honour the god of forces.</span> There are a number of questions here. To whom does the prenominal suffix refer? The English translators have arranged the words so that we cannot escape the view that "the estate" is the king's, but the natural meaning of the Hebrew order is that it is "on the place" or "pedestal" of the god. The word translated "estate" is used in <a href="/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a> for "office." It is used of the "base" of the "laver." It may mean "place." The next point - What Deity is meant by "the god of strong holds"? There is absolutely nothing to guide us in the matter. Some have supposed that the reference is to Jupiter Olympius, whose statue Antiochus is reported to have set np in the temple. Others, that the reference is to Jupiter Capitolinus. Were there any evidences that Antiochus worshipped the genius of Rome, something might be urged for this; but we have no evidence of this. In the absence of anything to fix a definite meaning on this word, we feel inclined to suggest that Jehovah is meant by the <span class="accented">slosh mauzzeem.</span> Repeatedly in the Psalms is God declared to be the Strength of the saint; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> Of Jehovah it might be said that the ancestors of Antiochus - Greek and Syrian - knew him not. <span class="accented">Honour with gold</span>, etc. The repeated defeats of the armies of Antiochus and the spoiling of their camps by the followers of Jehovah, was giving honour to Jehovah, however unwittingly and unwillingly it was done.
