In ancient Near Eastern culture, prostration was a sign of deep respect or submission, often reserved for deities or kings. Nebuchadnezzar's action signifies his recognition of a power greater than his own, as he acknowledges the divine wisdom revealed through Daniel. This moment is pivotal, as it shows a shift in Nebuchadnezzar's understanding of authority and power, aligning with the biblical theme that God humbles the proud (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>paid homage to Daniel</b><br>Paying homage was an act of reverence or worship, typically directed towards gods or kings. Nebuchadnezzar's homage to Daniel underscores the extraordinary nature of Daniel's revelation and interpretation of the king's dream. It highlights the influence of God's wisdom working through His servants, as seen in other biblical figures like Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-40</a>). This act also foreshadows the ultimate homage that all nations will pay to Christ, the true King (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him</b><br>Offerings and incense were customary in worship practices, often used to honor deities. Nebuchadnezzar's command to present these to Daniel reflects his misunderstanding of the source of Daniel's wisdom, attributing divine status to Daniel himself. This mirrors the cultural and religious practices of Babylon, where offerings were made to gods to seek favor or express gratitude. Theologically, this moment contrasts with the biblical teaching that glory and worship belong to God alone (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ, where offerings and incense symbolize the worship due to Jesus, who is the ultimate revelation of God's wisdom and power (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, except for Daniel.

Moments earlier, Daniel declared, &#8220;There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>). The accurate revelation left no doubt that the God of Israel alone ruled history, echoing <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face</b><p>&#8226; The most powerful man on earth collapses before a teenage exile.

Daniel likely accepted the gifts as royal honor yet maintained that &#8220;the God of heaven&#8221; deserved the worship (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty shines as He compels a pagan monarch to acknowledge His servant, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies live at peace with him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a> records the immediate, astonished response of Nebuchadnezzar to the prophetic accuracy displayed through Daniel. The king&#8217;s prostration, homage, and offerings underscore how unmistakably God&#8217;s revelation pierced a pagan heart. While Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s actions mix respect for Daniel with confused worship, the episode powerfully testifies that the Most High can humble emperors, exalt faithful servants, and make His dominion known to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">Worshipped.--</span>This act is of an entirely different nature from such as are mentioned <a href="/genesis/33-7.htm" title="And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.">Genesis 33:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-16.htm" title="And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.

Probably the king imagined that the gods were dwelling in Daniel in a higher sense from that in which they dwelt with his other wise men, and worshipped them on account of the marvellous revelation which they had vouchsafed to him through the means of Daniel.<p><span class= "bld">Oblation.</span>--That is, the unbloody offering customary among the Babylonians; some honour different from the present mentioned in <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm" title="Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.">Daniel 2:48</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span> The Greek versions render in such a way that we are almost obliged to recognize an act of idolatrous worship. Jerome, too, distinctly says," Nebuchodonoser... Danielem ador-avit et hostias et incensnm praecepit ut sacri-ficarent." The same idea is conveyed by the Peshitta, but less definitely, from the fact that <span class="accented">qorban</span> means a "gift" as well as an "oblation;" though the gift is usually a consecrated gift. In the Aramaic of the Bible we have certain phrases used for "sacrifice;" several of these are here employed: it is true all of them have the possibility of being used in a somewhat lower meaning. The mere "falling down before Daniel upon his face," when the person who did it was Nebuchadnezzar, is extraordinary, and can only be explained by the idea of worship. When we find the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">segad</span>) used immediately after, it is very difficult to refuse to believe that the Greek Version and Jerome are right when they translate the latter word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The word occurs repeatedly in the following chapter, invariably as "worship." The corresponding Hebrew word occurs in the second chapter of Isaiah, in the sense of "idolatrous worship" (<a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). It certainly does mean "to bend." Had the word thus stood alone, we could not have been certain that it meant "worship;" but when it follows the extreme act of prostration to the earth, "worship' must be meant. The separate terms, <span class="accented">minhah</span>, <span class="accented">nihohin</span>, <span class="accented">lenassakah lah</span>, might, taken separately, mean "gifts" and the "bestowment of gifts;" but, taken together, it is impossible not to regard the action as one of sacrificial offering. It is true <span class="accented">minhah</span> means "a present," as when Jacob sends a present to Esau (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>); but, in that connection, <span class="accented">nasak is</span> not used. It is quite true that the burning of sweet odours was a common enough thing in entertaining guests whom it was desired to honour, but the term <span class="accented">neehoheen</span> was not given to the aromatic woods so used. People sometimes, even at present, scent their rooms by burning aromatic woods, but they never in such <span class="accented">cases</span> call them <span class="accented">incense.</span> But from the fact that the old Greek version and Jerome read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">hostias</span>, the doubt seems forced upon us that the reading here has been altered, and that the true reading was <span class="accented">deebheen -</span> not <span class="accented">neehoheen - this</span> is a change that could with difficulty be imagined as occurring accidentally, but readily enough might happen from the desire to defend Daniel from the charge of allowing idolatrous worship to be offered to him. The instance referred to as parallel - the homage which Josephus relates Alexander the Great gave to Jaddua - is not quite on all fours with the present case. We are, in the first place, expressly told that it was "<span class="accented">the</span> name" of Jehovah, engraved on the <span class="accented">petalon</span> on the front of the priest's mitre, that Alexander worshipped (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). In the next place, we have no notice of sacrifice or incense being ordered to be offered to the high priest. It is not correct to say that <span class="accented">nasak</span> of necessity means "pour out an oblation," to the exclusion of the more general meaning of "<span class="accented">offer sacrifice."</span> The corresponding word in Arabic means "to sacrifice" (Behrmann). Behrmann says, in regard to this, truly, "As to Porphyry later, so to the author and to the first readers of this book, it would have seemed indecent if Daniel had allowed himself to be honoured as a god." This would have been true had the author been a contemporary of the Maccabees. The tide of feeling that led Peter to refuse the prostration of Cornelius, and Paul and Barnabas the sacrifices at Lystra, would have prevented any one inventing such a scene. It is perfectly true the worship was probably directed to the Divine Spirit as resident in Daniel, rather than to Daniel himself; few except the lowest and most degraded of heathen worshipped idols in any other way - the divine spirit, the deity, was the real object of worship, whose sign they were, and who resided in them. We must bear in mind that Daniel had been brought up in an idolatrous court, perhaps, also, he had to submit, on pain of suffering the fate that befell Paul and Barnabas when they refused the worship of the people of Lystra. We must lay stress on the very different relationship to idolatry and its worship implied in Daniel thus suffering sacrifice and incense to be offered to him, from that subsisting in the time of the Maccabees. No writer of that period would have written a sacred romance in which he represented a servant of God receiving idolatrous honours. The attitude of later Judaism is exemplified by Jephet-ibn-Ali, who says that though "Nebuchadnezzar commanded that sacrifices be brought to him as to a god, he (Daniel) does not say that he brought them to him. Most probably Daniel prohibited him from doing so." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1440;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
