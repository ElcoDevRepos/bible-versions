In the context of <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, the voice belongs to a "watcher" or "holy one" from heaven, emphasizing divine intervention. The loud voice signifies the importance of the message, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God or His messengers speak with authority, such as in <a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Cut down the tree and chop off its branches;</b><br>The tree symbolizes King Nebuchadnezzar and his vast empire. Cutting it down represents God's judgment and the impending fall of the king's power. This imagery is consistent with other biblical uses of trees to symbolize leaders or nations, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-14</a>, where Assyria is likened to a cedar of Lebanon.<p><b>strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.</b><br>Stripping the leaves and scattering the fruit signifies the removal of the king's glory and the dispersion of his resources and people. This action reflects the consequences of pride and disobedience to God, as seen in the scattering of Israel due to their unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>).<p><b>Let the beasts flee from under it,</b><br>The beasts represent the subjects and nations that found protection and prosperity under Nebuchadnezzar's rule. Their fleeing indicates the loss of security and stability once the king's power is removed. This can be paralleled with the scattering of the nations at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8</a>).<p><b>and the birds from its branches.</b><br>Birds often symbolize various peoples or nations in biblical literature. Their departure from the branches further illustrates the disintegration of the empire's influence and the widespread impact of the king's downfall. This imagery is echoed in Jesus' parable of the mustard seed, where birds find shelter in the branches, symbolizing the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who has a dream about a great tree, which is interpreted by Daniel.

Because Scripture reports events accurately, we take the angel&#8217;s voice as a literal summons to judgment, not mere symbolism (cf. <a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cut down the tree</b><p>&#8226; The tree represents King Nebuchadnezzar himself (<a href="/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20-22</a>). Just as Assyria&#8217;s towering cedar was felled in <a href="/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10-14</a>, so Babylon&#8217;s proud monarch will be humbled. <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a> reminds us that &#8220;the axe lies ready at the root of the trees,&#8221; underscoring God&#8217;s right to act decisively against pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And chop off its branches</b><p>&#8226; Branches picture the king&#8217;s extensive influence&#8212;his officials, provinces, and alliances. Their removal foretells the severing of his reach (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>). Pride destroys not only the person but also the structures that pride built.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Strip off its leaves</b><p>&#8226; Leaves are the visible splendor of the tree; stripping them speaks of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s glory departing. <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a> compares fallen leaves to collapsing power, while <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> laments that when judgment comes, &#8220;the leaves are withered.&#8221; The king&#8217;s majesty will fade before all eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And scatter its fruit</b><p>&#8226; Fruit stands for the benefits others enjoyed under Babylon&#8212;prosperity, security, trade. When God scatters that fruit (<a href="/revelation/18-14.htm">Revelation 18:14</a>), the empire&#8217;s resources vanish. A once-abundant kingdom becomes barren, demonstrating that every good gift ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let the beasts flee from under it</b><p>&#8226; Previously, &#8220;Under it the beasts of the field found shelter&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>). Now they must run. Those who depended on Babylon&#8217;s stability&#8212;subject peoples, allied nations&#8212;will seek refuge elsewhere (<a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>). Losing the king&#8217;s covering highlights how human power cannot guarantee lasting safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the birds from its branches</b><p>&#8226; Birds that once nested in security (<a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>) will scatter, a vivid picture of total upheaval. Jesus used similar imagery in <a href="/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a> for the mustard seed&#8217;s growth; here we see the reverse&#8212;collapse instead of expansion. God alone grants and removes places of rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> is a literal, heaven-issued sentence proclaiming that God will dismantle Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s pride piece by piece&#8212;authority, influence, glory, resources, and dependents. The verse warns that every earthly kingdom stands or falls at the Lord&#8217;s command, urging us to walk humbly, recognizing that only God&#8217;s kingdom remains unshakable (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Aloud</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> like a king's herald. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm" title="Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,">Daniel 3:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hew down.</span>--The plural is here used, implying that several persons are employed in carrying out the order.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, cut off his branches, shako off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches.</span> The Septuagint Version is, "And one called and said to him, Cut it down, and destroy it; for it is decreed by the Highest to root it out and destroy it." It is possible that abbey in the Greek was due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">kayn</span>) being read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>). The phrase as it stands in the Greek is not unlike <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, "And another cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle." It is, therefore, equally possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>) has been changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">kayn</span>). The latter part of the verse is more condensed, and therefore, by that, more probable; only the rooting out commanded seems to contradict the fact that it is also commanded to leave "one root of it." Theodotion is in much closer agreement with the Massoretic, save that the <span class="accented">beasts</span>, instead of being warned to depart from beneath the shadow of the tree, are to be shaken (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x1fd6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) from beneath it, as are all the birds from its branches. The Peshitta is an accurate translation of the text of the Massoretes. A peculiarity to be observed in the Aramaic is that the verbs are in the plural, which is retained in Theodotion and the Peshitta. It seems difficult to understand this. Stuart's explanation ? which is practically that of Havernick and Hitzig - that the command is addressed by the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> ('eer) to his retinue, seems highly forced, as there has been no word of a retinue. Keil's and Kliefoth's view, that the plural is the impersonal, does not suit the circumstances. We have a suspicion that the plural is due to a mistake - thinking the watcher and the holy one were separate persons. The Septuagint, however, has the plural, which is all the more extraordinary that <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> is singular. The function assigned here to the angels must be observed. Here, as in the parables of our Lord, the angels are the instruments by whom the decrees of providence are executed. In our days angels are not believed in.
