The "king of the South" is traditionally understood to be the ruler of Egypt, part of the Ptolemaic dynasty during the Hellenistic period. Historically, this aligns with the ongoing conflicts between the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt and the Seleucid Empire, which were part of the larger Diadochi wars following the death of Alexander the Great. The phrase "many will rise up" suggests a coalition or multiple factions opposing the king, indicating widespread unrest and dissatisfaction with the ruling power. This can be seen as part of the broader theme of conflict and power struggles that characterize the prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>Violent ones among your own people will exalt themselves in fulfillment of the vision,</b><br>Here, "your own people" refers to the Jewish people, indicating that some within the Jewish community will take aggressive action. The "violent ones" are likely those who seek to assert their own power or influence, possibly through rebellion or insurrection. This could be seen as a reference to the Maccabean Revolt, where Jewish leaders rose against the Seleucid Empire's attempts to impose Hellenistic culture and religion. The phrase "in fulfillment of the vision" suggests that these actions are part of a divine plan or prophecy, aligning with the broader narrative of Daniel where human actions are seen as fulfilling God's sovereign purposes.<p><b>but they will fail.</b><br>This indicates that the efforts of these "violent ones" will not succeed in achieving their goals. Historically, while the Maccabean Revolt did lead to a period of Jewish independence, many other uprisings and attempts to assert power during this era were unsuccessful. Theologically, this failure can be interpreted as a reminder of the limitations of human efforts when they are not aligned with God's will. It underscores the theme of divine sovereignty present throughout the Book of Daniel, where ultimate success and fulfillment of prophecy are determined by God, not by human ambition or violence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_south.htm">King of the South</a></b><br>This refers to the ruler of Egypt, a key player in the geopolitical struggles described in <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>.

We appear to be within "a very few days" (see <a href="/daniel/11-20.htm" title="Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.">Daniel 11:20</a>) of the vile-person who corresponds to the little horn of the fourth beast. At this period the king of the south suffers from many hostile opponents, while certain others, more closely connected with the Jews, become prominent for a while, but then fail. The obscurity of the Hebrew text was felt by the LXX., and distinct historical allusions can be found by those only who are determined to find them. These are stated to be some insurrections during the early years of Ptolemy Epiphanes, and a league which some of the Jews made with Antiochus the Great against Ptolemy.<p><span class= "bld">Robbers of thy people.--</span>This difficult expression occurs only in five other passages (<a href="/psalms/17-4.htm" title="Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.">Psalm 17:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm" title="No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:">Isaiah 35:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm" title="Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?

The words in this passage can only refer to certain Jews who committed various violent breaches of the Law, and on this occasion revolted against the king of the south. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall</span>. The versions here differ from this, which represents the Massoretic with fair accuracy. The LXX. renders, "And in those times thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) shall rise against the King of Egypt, and he shall build again that which has fallen down of thy people " - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">oobanah</span>), "and he shall build," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">oobenee</span>), "and sons of;" he has read also <span class="accented">peratzee</span>, "breaches," instead of <span class="accented">peritzee</span>, "robbers," - "and he shall raise himself up" - reading singular instead of plural - "to fulfil the prophecy, and they shall stumble." This confusion indicates that the reading of the LXX. is mistaken. Theodotion is as much removed from the Massoretic as is the above, "And in those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the sons of the plagues (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) of thy people shall be exalted to establish the vision, and they shall become weak." If there were any trace of uncertainty in the reading at this point, we might be tempted to read <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, written <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x397;&#x399;&#x39e;&#x3a4;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x399;&#x39c;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span>. The reading of Nestle (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is no improvement. The Peshitta renders, "And many shall rise against the king of the north, and the sons of the perversity of thy people shall be raised up to fulfil the vision, and shall be cast down." The change from "king of the south" to "the king of the north" must be noted, probably simply the result of blunder. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="accented">pre-varieatorum</span>, <span class="accented">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south.</span> Ptolemy Epiphanes was not only exposed to the assault of the confederates Antiochus and Philip of Macedon; but there were intrigues and conspiracies in the palace. <span class="accented">Also</span> <span class="accented">the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sons of the oppressors.</span> Commentators of all varieties have assumed that these are Jews. Hitzig maintains that they were the Jews that sided with Antiochus's rule ('Historical Exposition of Daniel'); that they were the separatists, those who had gone down to Egypt (Calvin; Behrmann, 'Die Stiirmische Jugend'); Keil, "violent men who break through Divine law." So Kranichfeld and Wordsworth. Stuart, "the violent of thy people;" Ewald, "young high-handed men." Fuller thinks the word <span class="accented">prizzeem</span> is used as "rulers." Griitz would render, "to establish the vision, to make the law to totter " - an attempt to get, by addition to the text, an explanation. The Hebrew text does not bear out this meaning.
