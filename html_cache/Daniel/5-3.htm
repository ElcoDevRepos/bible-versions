These vessels were crafted according to divine specifications given to Moses and later used in Solomon's Temple. Their use in Babylon signifies a profound act of sacrilege, as they were intended for holy purposes.<p><b>that had been taken from the temple,</b><br>These vessels were seized by Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The temple, built by Solomon, was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence. The removal of these items symbolized the defeat of Judah and the apparent triumph of Babylonian gods over Yahweh.<p><b>the house of God in Jerusalem,</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the sacred origin of the vessels, highlighting the gravity of their misuse. Jerusalem was the spiritual heart of Israel, and the temple was considered God's earthly dwelling. The desecration of these items in a pagan setting underscores the theme of divine judgment and the eventual vindication of God's holiness.<p><b>and the king drank from them,</b><br>King Belshazzar's act of drinking from the vessels is a direct affront to God, demonstrating arrogance and irreverence.

Sacred vessels once set apart for worship are dragged into a drunken orgy, signaling an open challenge to heaven. The verse sets the stage for swift judgment, proving that God defends His holiness, humbles the arrogant, and rules over every kingdom on earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> <span class="cmt_word">they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in</span> <span class="cmt_word">them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</span> The corresponding verses in the Septuagint differ in several points from those above; the Septuagint third verse contains, condensed, the Massoretic third and fourth verses, but adds new matter in its fourth verse: "(3) And they were brought, and they drank in them, and blessed their idols made with hands; (4) and the God the eternal, who hath dominion over their spirit ('breath,' <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), they did not bless." In the introductory portion, which contains, as we think, marginal readings, we have the second and fourth verses brought into connection, "In that day Baltasar, being uplifted with wine, and boasting himself, praised in his drink all the gods of the nations, the molten and the carved, but to God the Highest he gave not praise." The reading of the latter portion of this seems better than the text, as it is briefer; the description of God as he that has power "over their breath," is a preparation for what we find in ver. 23, "and thy breath is in his hand." Theodotion is, as usual, much nearer the Massoretic text, but while the Massoretic only mentions the "golden" vessels being brought, Theodotion mentions the silver also, and the verb <span class="accented">hanpiqoo</span> is translated singular, as if it were <span class="accented">hanpayq</span>, and "Nebuchadnezzar" understood. A various reading adds, "and the God of eternity, who hath power of their breath, did they not bless," according to the Alexandrine and Vatican codices. In both these cases Jerome follows Theodotion. The Peshitta agrees only in the latter, putting the verb in the singular. Modern translators, as Luther and Ewald, the Authorized and Revised English Versions, retain the plural, but make the verb passive, as if it were written <span class="accented">honpaqoo.</span> Calvin alone preserves both number and voice. The French Version, which makes it impersonal, is probably as good as any. It is, however, not impossible that the true reading is huphal; that seems better than Calvin's suggestion, that what Nebuchadnezzar had done is now transferred to all the Babylonians. The praises of the gods being sung was especially natural, if this were a dedication of a palace. In such a case the various elemental deities would be invoked to bless the residence of the king. The fact that the vessels belonging to the temple of the God of the Jews were brought forward from the treasury of Bel would afford an occasion for praising Bel, the god who had given them the victory. While they praised these god, of the nations, they did not even mention Jehovah - an addition in the text of Theodotion and the LXX., both text and margin, and therefore one that, we think, ought, in some form, to lie in the text. It is singular that in the Cyrus Cylinder, 17, the overthrow of Nabunahid is attributed to Marduk, "whom Nabunahid did not fear." The reason of Belshazzar thus ostentatiously praising the gods might be to get over the reputation of unfaithfulness to the gods, which was weakening them, father and <span class="accented">son</span>, in their struggle with Cyrus. Belshazzar most likely was, at this very time, carrying on war against Cyrus. The object of this festive gathering of his nobles might be to hearten them in their struggle against the King of Persia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
