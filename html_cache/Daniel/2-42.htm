The toes represent the final stage of the statue, which is composed of different materials, each symbolizing successive kingdoms. The mixture of iron and clay suggests a divided kingdom, with elements of strength and weakness. Iron, a strong metal, symbolizes power and durability, while clay, a fragile material, indicates instability and vulnerability. This duality reflects the nature of the kingdom, which will have strong elements but will also be prone to division and internal conflict. The imagery of toes suggests a fragmented political structure, possibly representing a coalition of states or regions that lack cohesion.<p><b>so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle</b><br>The kingdom described here is often interpreted as the Roman Empire or a future revived form of it, characterized by both strength and fragility. Historically, the Roman Empire was known for its military might and extensive reach, symbolized by the iron. However, it also faced internal divisions, political corruption, and social unrest, akin to the brittleness of clay. The prophecy suggests that while the kingdom will have formidable power, it will also be susceptible to collapse due to its inherent weaknesses. This duality can be seen as a warning about the limitations of human empires, which, despite their might, are ultimately unstable without a foundation in divine principles. Theologically, this points to the transient nature of earthly kingdoms in contrast to the eternal kingdom of God, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where God's kingdom will crush and bring an end to all these kingdoms, establishing a dominion that will never be destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and interpreter of dreams who served in the court of Babylonian kings.

By drawing attention to the toes, the vision drills down to the very last portion of the fourth kingdom&#8217;s timeline. Later in the chapter, the ten toes are linked to &#8220;a divided kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41</a>) and find a parallel in the &#8220;ten kings&#8221; of <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a> and <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>. Just as toes cap off the feet, these rulers appear at the closing stage of Gentile world dominion before Christ establishes His eternal kingdom (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were partly iron and partly clay</b><p>Iron had already pictured the crushing power of Rome (<a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>). Clay, by contrast, is common and fragile. The mingling of the two in the toes signals a future resurgence of Roman influence that will be marked by internal incompatibility. <a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a> explains, &#8220;they will mix with one another but will not hold together.&#8221; History never recorded a ten-kingdom phase of ancient Rome, so the prophecy points forward to a revived form of that empire&#8212;strong in certain aspects (military, technology, economy) yet shot through with elements that simply do not cohere. <a href="/revelation/17-13.htm">Revelation 17:13</a> portrays these kings giving united authority to one purpose, but only &#8220;for one hour,&#8221; underscoring the temporary, uneasy alliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so this kingdom</b><p>The phrase looks back to the &#8220;fourth kingdom&#8221; of <a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>. Scripture consistently treats the statue&#8217;s segments as a progression of literal world empires: Babylon (head of gold), Medo-Persia (chest and arms of silver), Greece (belly and thighs of bronze), and Rome (legs of iron). Therefore &#8220;this kingdom&#8221; in verse 42 refers not to a vague spiritual realm but to the same Roman lineage&#8212;now re-emerging in the last days. Jesus echoed the timeline when He spoke of &#8220;the times of the Gentiles&#8221; continuing until His return (<a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be partly strong</b><p>The iron component remains. Like ancient Rome, the end-time confederation will wield real strength&#8212;political clout, economic muscle, military force. <a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a> hints at global awe: &#8220;Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?&#8221; Yet the power is uneven. Some regions or leaders will possess robust influence, giving the coalition the iron fist that still terrifies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and partly brittle</b><p>Clay crumbles under stress. The alliance that seems formidable on paper will fracture under pressure&#8212;whether ethnic tensions, ideological clashes, or simple power struggles. <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a> foreshadows the nations raging yet failing to break free from God&#8217;s ultimate plan. When the stone &#8220;cut out without hands&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34-35</a>) strikes the feet, the inherent brittleness guarantees collapse. No revival of Rome, however imposing, can withstand the decisive intervention of Christ at His second coming (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-42.htm">Daniel 2:42</a> teaches that the final form of the Roman empire will be a ten-kingdom coalition symbolized by toes of iron mixed with clay.
