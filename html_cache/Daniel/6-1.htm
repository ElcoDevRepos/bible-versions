Historically, there is debate about his exact identity, with some scholars suggesting he could be a title for Cyrus the Great or another regional governor. The phrase indicates Darius's satisfaction or approval, suggesting a ruler who is actively involved in governance and decision-making. This reflects the administrative style of the Medo-Persian Empire, which valued order and structure.<p><b>to appoint 120 satraps</b><br>Satraps were provincial governors in the ancient Persian Empire, responsible for maintaining order and collecting taxes. The number 120 suggests a vast and organized empire, divided into manageable regions. This system of governance was advanced for its time and allowed for efficient control over a large territory. The appointment of satraps demonstrates the empire's emphasis on delegation and local governance, which is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the book of Esther.<p><b>to rule throughout the kingdom</b><br>The kingdom refers to the Medo-Persian Empire, which was expansive, covering parts of modern-day Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and beyond. The phrase underscores the vastness of the empire and the need for a structured administrative system. This system of governance ensured that the king's decrees and policies were implemented across diverse regions and cultures. The concept of ruling throughout the kingdom also parallels the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and ultimate rule over all nations, as seen in Psalms and the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius_the_mede.htm">Darius the Mede</a></b><br>Darius is the ruler who takes over the kingdom after the fall of Babylon.

Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</span> The variations from the Massoretic text in the Septuagint are, in regard to the verses before us, very considerable. It assumes the last verse of the preceding chapter, and begins, "And he set up a hundred and twenty and seven satraps over all his kingdom. And over them he set three men as presidents (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), and Daniel was one of the three men [and had authority over all men in the kingdom. And Daniel was clothed in purple, and was great and honourable (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) before Darius the king, because he was honourable (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and understanding and prudent, and there was an holy spirit in him, and he prospered in the affairs of the kingdom which he did]. Then the king thought (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) to place Daniel over all his kingdom [(and the two men who stood with him and the hundred and twenty-seven satraps) when the king thought to place Daniel over his whole kingdom]." The passages within brackets, we think, are additions to amplify the description, and to connect it with the honor given Daniel by Belshazzar. The bracketed parts are easily separable from the rest, and then what remains forms a continuous narrative. Theodotion differs, though slightly, from the Massoretic text, Darius "set (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) Daniel over the kingdom" - did not merely take counsel to do it. The Peshitta agrees also very closely with the Massoretic, only the word for "princes" is not, as in the Massoretic text, <span class="accented">ahashdarpnayya</span>, but <span class="accented">rabu heel.</span> This is the common rendering in the Peshitta of this word, and points to the Massoretic term being an adaptation. the use of the word "satrap" here has led to the idea that this is derived from the hundred and twenty-seven provinces (<a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). This identification is supported certainly by the LXX., which gives a hundred and twenty-seven as the number of the satraps set up by Darius. Josephus, it may be noted ('Ant.,' 10:11.4), mentions the satrapies as three hundred and sixty - a reading that seems scarcely to be drawn by any conceivable mistake from the Massoretie text, nor any tradition of the actual number of satrapis under the Persian rule. The probability is that there has been some early corruption of the number. On the supposition that Darius is Gobryas, these satraps would really be governors of cities and small districts in the populous province of Babylon. We have in the inscriptions of the <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> monarchs who intervened in the affairs of Babylon and Chaldea, notices of a large number of small kingships: each of these would require a special governor. In harmony with this, we are informed by Mr. Pinches that Gobryas appointed subordinate governors in the territory of <span class="cmt_word"></span> Babylon. The phrase which states this occurs in the Annals of Nabunahid (col. 3. line 20), "And Gobryas his governor appointed governors in Babylon." Delitzsch ('Beitrage zur Assyriologie,' 2. p. 256) points out that the sign of the plural after the second occurrence of the word "governor" proves that we cannot translate as if "Cyrus" were the nominative to the sentence, and "Gobryas," who was governor of <span class="accented">Gutium</span> or <span class="accented">Guti</span>, was object. From the fact that the text of Daniel was not protected by being regularly read in the synagogues, as was the Law, the Prophets, the Megilloth, the Psalms, and some other books, it was more at the mercy of scribes. The change of "Gobryas" into "Darius" led easily to other modifications. Probably <span class="accented">medeena</span>, "province," was the word in the original text, but it was modified to <span class="accented">malcoutha</span>, "kingdom," and "governors" of cities became "satraps" over provinces. After having appointed these subordinate governors, that a board of three should be set over them was a necessary arrangement. The name given to them, <span class="accented">sarekeen</span>, is asserted by some to be of Persian origin. On the other hand, the fact that the first syllable is <span class="accented">sar</span>, the Assyrian for "king," one is tempted to think of a Semitic etymology. The Authorized is wrong in making Daniel "first" of these presidents; all that is asserted is that Daniel was one of these presidents. <span class="accented">That the king should have no damage</span> applies most probably to the revenue. The country, in the East, is divided off into small districts for the purpose of tax-collecting, and in the division of the Persian Empire into twenty satrapies, this was greatly the object. The repetition of the word "king" here might imply that Darius was not the king whose loss of revenue was to be guarded against; but we weald not be held as pressing this. Although Daniel was not, on the creation of this board, made chief of it, he soon acquired an influence over Darius which gave him, in effect, such a position. We arc to understand that these officials were mainly Babylonians. We learn now that the capture of Babylonia by Cyrus was not accomplished by a skilful diverting of the waters of the Euphrates, so that the Persian troops were enabled to wade in by the bed of the stream, nor to the fact that in the revelry of a feast the river-gates were left open, and the sentinels were careless; but to the fact that the whole official class were at enmity with the court, and so treachery opened the gates to Gobryas, the governor of Gutium, the name given to Mesopotamia as a Persian province, and when morning broke one day, the sixteenth of Tammuz, the inhabitants of Babylon saw the shields of Gutium guarding the citadel and the temple Esakkil. This being the case. naturally the official class of the former monarchy would be largely drawn upon to supply the needs of the new government; naturally the native Babylonians would think that the preference in all matters of office ought to be given to them; that, above all, the principal place should not be given to a Jew by Cyrus, or by any one under him, since Cyrus professed to be moved by reverence for the national gods of Babylon in his war against Nabunahid. <span class="accented">And the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</span> This really means over the province of Babylon, <span class="accented">malcoutha</span> being written instead of <span class="accented">medeena.</span> His object was not to make Daniel satrap instead of himself, but to make him his "vizier." His knowledge of the <span class="accented">business</span> of the province would of necessity be very thorough, dating, as it did, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar. He, as no other, would be acquainted with the various religious beliefs of the different captive communities in Babylonia. Himself belonging to one of these communities, his interest would be excited by all in similar circumstances. His age, the dignity he had enjoyed in the courts of Nebuchadnezzar and Nabunahid, along with his zeal and ability, naturally explain the desire of Darius (Gobryas) to make him his vizier. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;p&#772;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8232.htm">Strong's 8232: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be fair or seemly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pleased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1459;&#1491;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(qo&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6925.htm">Strong's 6925: </a> </span><span class="str2">Before</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Darius</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1493;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;we&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1868.htm">Strong's 1868: </a> </span><span class="str2">Darius -- two person kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to appoint</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
