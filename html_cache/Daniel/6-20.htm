The den was likely a pit or cave with an opening at the top, typical of ancient Near Eastern practices for holding dangerous animals. The king's personal visit underscores his concern and the gravity of the situation.<p><b>he cried out in a voice of anguish</b><br>Darius's emotional state is evident here. Despite being a king, he shows genuine distress, indicating his respect and affection for Daniel. This reflects the king's internal conflict between his decree and his regard for Daniel, highlighting the human element in leadership and governance.<p><b>O Daniel, servant of the living God</b><br>Darius acknowledges Daniel's faith and the God he serves. The term "living God" contrasts with the lifeless idols worshiped in Babylon, emphasizing the active and powerful nature of Daniel's God. This acknowledgment by a pagan king points to the influence of Daniel's testimony.<p><b>has your God, whom you serve continually</b><br>Daniel's consistent faithfulness is noted by Darius, showing that Daniel's devotion was well-known and respected. This phrase highlights the importance of steadfastness in faith, serving as a model for believers to maintain their witness in all circumstances.<p><b>been able to deliver you from the lions?</b><br>The question reflects both hope and uncertainty. Darius's inquiry suggests an awareness of God's power, possibly influenced by Daniel's previous interpretations of dreams and miraculous events. This moment foreshadows the deliverance theme found throughout Scripture, pointing to God's ability to save His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ's victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God, known for his unwavering devotion and integrity.

hastening to the empty tomb (<a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>).<p>- Scripture often portrays leaders pacing on city walls or gates in anxious expectation (<a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24&#8211;25</a>), underscoring that human power is helpless when confronted with divine judgment or deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He cried out in a voice of anguish</b><p>- The king&#8217;s distressed tone shows genuine affection for Daniel and an uneasy conscience over a law he regrets (<a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a>).<p>- His cry resembles the desperate petitions of <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> and <a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>, where voices lift heavenward in bleak circumstances, yet still cling to hope.<p>- Even rulers bow emotionally before God&#8217;s mysteries; their authority cannot silence the anxious questions bursting from their hearts (<a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Daniel, servant of the living God</b><p>- By calling Daniel &#8220;servant,&#8221; Darius recognizes that Daniel answers to a higher Master than any earthly throne (cf. <a href="/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29</a>; <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;living God&#8221;

(<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>).<p>- Earlier, Daniel&#8217;s friends trusted that &#8220;our God &#8230; is able to deliver&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17</a>), and <a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a> celebrates those &#8220;who shut the mouths of lions.&#8221;<p>- Paul later echoed the same confidence: &#8220;The Lord &#8230;

Darius runs, cries, and calls the prophet by a title that exalts God alone. He highlights Daniel&#8217;s unwavering worship and wonders aloud whether the living God can triumph over savage lions. Every phrase testifies that steady devotion meets sovereign deliverance, affirming that the Lord who rules beasts and kings alike is fully able to save those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Is thy God</span> . . . <span class= "bld">able</span>?--The faith of this king is very weak.
