The "calamity" refers to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The use of "kept in store" suggests God's patience and long-suffering, as He delayed judgment to give Israel opportunities to repent. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine justice and mercy. The historical context is the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a significant event that confirmed the prophetic warnings. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and the certainty of His word.<p><b>For the LORD our God is righteous in all He does;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's inherent righteousness, a central attribute of His character. It reflects the biblical understanding that God's actions are always just and right, even when they involve judgment. This righteousness is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a> and <a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>, which affirm God's just nature. Theologically, it points to the idea that God's judgments are not arbitrary but are based on His holy standards. This righteousness is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's justice and mercy, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.<p><b>yet we have not obeyed His voice.</b><br>This phrase highlights the persistent disobedience of Israel, despite God's clear instructions and repeated calls to repentance. It echoes the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where obedience was a condition for blessing (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). The phrase "His voice" signifies God's direct communication through the Law and the prophets. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in the narratives of the Judges and Kings. It serves as a reminder of human fallibility and the need for a savior, pointing to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the one who perfectly obeyed God's will on behalf of humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Book of Daniel, known for his faithfulness to God and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is righteous and just in His actions and judgments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that has experienced calamity due to their disobedience to God's commands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/calamity.htm">Calamity</a></b><br>The consequences of Israel's disobedience, which God has allowed as a form of judgment and correction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Daniel's prayer, where the Israelites were taken captive due to their persistent disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_in_judgment.htm">God's Righteousness in Judgment</a></b><br>God's actions are always just and righteous, even when they involve judgment or calamity.

Because Scripture is literally true, history unfolded exactly as foretold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the LORD our God is righteous in all He does</b><p>&#8226; Even while confessing national ruin, Daniel defends God&#8217;s character: &#8220;The Rock, His work is perfect; for all His ways are justice&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s righteousness means His actions always align with His holy nature (<a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By stating this, Daniel wipes away any thought that God was unfair or excessive; the punishment fit the persistent rebellion.<p>&#8226; Recognizing God&#8217;s righteousness is the first step toward genuine repentance&#8212;agreeing with Him about sin and its consequences (<a href="/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet we have not obeyed His voice</b><p>&#8226; The stark contrast shifts the spotlight from God&#8217;s spotless record to Israel&#8217;s repeated disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23-26</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;voice&#8221; came through the Law and the prophets; ignoring that voice was willful, not accidental (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By confessing in the plural&#8212;&#8220;we&#8221;&#8212;Daniel identifies with the nation&#8217;s guilt, illustrating true intercessory prayer.<p>&#8226; The phrase also looks forward: if judgment came because of disobedience, restoration will come through a renewed obedience promised in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14</a> ties together God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and human responsibility. The disaster of exile was not a breach of promise but its fulfillment; God remained righteous while Israel rebelled. Acknowledging this balance&#8212;God&#8217;s just action and our need to obey&#8212;prepares hearts to receive the mercy Daniel seeks in the verses that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Watched.</span>--By the use of this word it seems that Daniel is again referring to the prophecies of Jeremiah. (See <a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.">Jeremiah 1:12</a>, &c.) He prays that as all the curses foretold by that prophet have been poured upon the nation, so also the release from the Captivity, which was also promised by him, may be accomplished also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not</span> <span class="cmt_word">his voice.</span> The Greek versions agree with this, save that the LXX. has "Lord God" in the first case as well as the second. The Peshitta, when one remembers the different division of the verses, is also identical. There is an obvious resemblance here to <a href="/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, "Behold, I am watching over you for evil, and not for good." The verb <span class="accented">shaqad is</span> somewhat rare, occurring only twelve times in Scripture, and five of these times in Jeremiah. It is not always an evil watching; in <a href="/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a> the two meanings are contrasted. Then follows an acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in so dealing with them Bar. 2:9 is really a version of this verse; the original Hebrew would be almost identical. There are few indications which, did this verse stand alone, would enable one to decide which is the more primitive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has kept the calamity</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
