Historically, this could refer to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his tyrannical rule over Israel. In a prophetic sense, it is often associated with the Antichrist, a future figure who will similarly act with autonomy and defiance against divine authority.<p><b>and will exalt and magnify himself above every god</b><br>This indicates a level of arrogance and self-deification. Antiochus IV declared himself as a god, even placing his image in the Jewish temple. In a broader prophetic context, this mirrors the actions of the Antichrist, as described in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, who will oppose and exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped.<p><b>and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods</b><br>The phrase "monstrous things" implies blasphemy and extreme disrespect. Antiochus IV desecrated the Jewish temple and outlawed Jewish religious practices.

Yet his rise, reign, and fall are all bounded by God&#8217;s sovereign timetable. The verse reassures believers that even the darkest chapter of human history remains under the Lord&#8217;s ultimate control, and every decree of Scripture will come to pass exactly as written.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">The king.--</span>He raises himself by his thoughts and deeds, not only above the heathen deities, but above the true God. Though there can be no doubt that the northern king is still spoken of, it must be remarked that the features of Antiochus are gradually fading away from the portrait. In no sense can Antiochus be called an Atheist; nor does the language of the writer of <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-12.htm" title="And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.">2 Maccabees 9:12</a>, "think of himself as if he were God," correspond with the words of this verse. Antiochus' main object was to Hellenise the Jewish religion, and to force the Greek gods upon the Jews. The character of the northern king, on the contrary, finds a parallel in St. Paul's description of Antichrist (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Marvellous things.--</span>That is, his utterances and blasphemies against the true God will be astounding. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/7-8.htm" title="I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.">Daniel 7:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-11.htm" title="I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.">Daniel 7:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-20.htm" title="And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.">Daniel 7:20</a>.) This will continue till God's indignation against His people is accomplished. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is determined shall be done</span>. The LXX. does not differ greatly from this, "And the king shall do according to his will, and shall be enraged, and be exalted above every god, and against the God of gods shall he speak marvellous things (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) and shall prosper until the wrath be accomplished; for on him (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) there is an end." The difference in the last clause is considerable between the LXX, and not easily explicable. Theodotion differs somewhat more, "And he shall do according to his will; and the king shall be exalted, and be magnified, and he shall speak marvellous things, and he shall prosper until the wrath is ended; for it is to a determined end (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Peshitta is closely related to the Massoretic, even in the last clause, where a difference is manifested in the others. The Vulgate affords no occasion of remark. The question that has to be settled here is - Who is the king who shall do according to his pleasure? Aben Ezra maintained the reference was to Constantine the Great. Rashi, followed by Calvin, would make it the Roman Empire personified. He notices the Rabbins' referring this to Titus and Vespasian. As above mentioned, his own view is that the 'Monarchia Romana' is here intended. Jephet-ibn-Ali sees in this a prophecy of Mohammed; others, Wordsworth and Rule, following Jerome and Luther, think the reference here is to the antichrist of the New Testament. For our own part, we see no necessity for supposing any other monarch than Epiphanes is referred to. While Livy and Polybius remark on the piety of Epiphanes, it may seem strange to refer what is said here to him; but his ruthless plundering of temples proved that his piety was merely a political expedient. <span class="accented">Speak marvellous things against the God of gods.</span> We have no record of any proclamations of Antiochus which exactly suit this; but then we must bear in mind that we have only compendious accounts of what he did proclaim. To the heathen, moreover, as to Polybius and Livy, words of contempt against Jehovah would seem nothing worse than impolitic; but to the Jew, blasphemous words would be so horrible that they would not be recorded, as being a contamination: hence it is not extraordinary that we hear nothing of blasphemy in the history of Antiochus. The forbidding of sacrifices and of circumcision, while clearly enough dishonouring to God and to the Jewish nation, do not contain enough to justify the statement. <span class="accented">Shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished.</span> If by the indignation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">za'am</span>) is meant the sufferings endured by the Jewish people, then the prosperity of Epiphanes - his life, indeed - did not last so long as the sufferings inflicted on the Jews; for these continued for some time after his death. There is probably here an indication that the writer's horizon did not reach to the death of Antiochus. Certain, by his faith in God, that Antiochus would perish, he thinks that until that time he may prosper. <span class="accented">For that that is determined shall be do</span>,<span class="accented">to.</span> There is considerable difficulty as to the text here, but all the various forms convey the same meaning - a definite limit to oppression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
