The men, likely the satraps and administrators, approached King Darius as a group, emphasizing their collective authority and pressure. This reflects the political intrigue and manipulation common in ancient courts, where alliances were often formed to achieve personal or political goals. The unity of these men contrasts with Daniel's solitary faithfulness, setting the stage for the conflict between human schemes and divine providence.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Remember, O king,</b><br>The phrase "Remember, O king," serves as a reminder to Darius of his own decree, subtly implying that he must uphold his authority and the laws he has enacted. This reflects the cultural importance of a king's word in ancient Near Eastern societies, where a ruler's decree was considered binding and unchangeable. The conspirators are appealing to the king's sense of duty and the inviolability of his word, which was a cornerstone of royal authority.<p><b>that by the law of the Medes and Persians</b><br>The "law of the Medes and Persians" refers to the legal system of the Medo-Persian Empire, known for its rigidity and permanence. Once a law was enacted, it could not be altered or revoked, even by the king himself. This legal principle is significant in the narrative, as it traps Darius into a position where he cannot save Daniel, despite his personal desire to do so. The unchangeable nature of these laws underscores the tension between human authority and divine intervention.<p><b>no decree or ordinance established by the king can be changed.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the irrevocability of the king's decree, highlighting the legal and cultural constraints within which Darius must operate. The conspirators exploit this aspect of Medo-Persian law to ensure that Daniel is punished, despite the king's favor towards him. This situation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of Daniel, illustrating the theme of God's sovereignty over human affairs. The unchangeable decree also serves as a type of Christ, who fulfills the unchangeable law through His death and resurrection, providing a way of salvation that transcends human limitations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the kingdom of Darius.

The corresponding verse in the Septuagint is much shorter, "And he was not able to deliver him from them." This verse in the Massoretic text has very much the appearance of a doublet mollified to fit a new position. The first clause has occurred already twice before in the sixth verse and the fifteenth. The last portion of the verse is a modification of what is stated in vers. 9 and 13. The first clause is omitted by Theodotion, but inserted by the Peshitta. The probability is that this verse, in its Massoretic form, has been inserted to explain the opposition the king strove in vain to overcome. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
