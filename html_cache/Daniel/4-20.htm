Trees in biblical literature often symbolize strength, growth, and prosperity. In this context, the tree represents Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. Trees are also used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, to symbolize a person or entity that flourishes under God's blessing.<p><b>that grew large and strong</b><br>The growth and strength of the tree symbolize the expansion and power of Nebuchadnezzar's empire. Historically, Babylon was a dominant force in the ancient Near East, known for its military conquests and architectural achievements, such as the Hanging Gardens. This imagery reflects the king's pride and the vastness of his rule.<p><b>whose top reached the sky</b><br>This phrase indicates the immense height and prominence of the tree, symbolizing Nebuchadnezzar's ambition and the extent of his influence. The imagery is reminiscent of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>), where humanity's pride led them to build a tower reaching the heavens, resulting in God's intervention.<p><b>and was visible to all the earth</b><br>The visibility of the tree to the entire earth signifies the widespread recognition and impact of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Babylon was a center of culture, trade, and power, influencing many nations. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual humbling of Nebuchadnezzar, as his pride and reach are contrasted with God's ultimate sovereignty over all kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had the dream about the large tree.

Similar prophetic pictures appear in <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-5</a>, where Assyria is likened to a cedar, and in <a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8-15</a>, where trees represent rulers. Scripture consistently uses vivid pictures to help us grasp spiritual truth, and here the Lord chooses a tree&#8212;something sturdy, life-giving, and visually dominant&#8212;to spotlight the king&#8217;s role in world events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that grew large and strong</b><p>- The verbs underline rapid expansion and solidification.

Yet the very scale that awes human eyes also invites divine scrutiny. The verse prepares readers for the humbling that follows: the Most High alone grants greatness and can just as easily cut it down.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) It should be noticed that both in this and in the following verse the description of the tree given in <a href="/context/daniel/4-11.htm" title="The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached to heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:">Daniel 4:11-12</a> is curtailed. It was observed that, on the contrary, there was an expansion of details in the interpretation of the former dream. (See Note on <a href="/daniel/4-23.htm" title="And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;">Daniel 4:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, an the sight thereof to all the earth; whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth</span>. The Septuagint Version here differs very considerably in wording from the above, but not in sense, "Thou, O king, art this tree planted in the earth, the appearance of which was great, and all the birds of the heaven made their nests in it: the strength of the earth and of the nations, and of all tongues to the ends of the earth, and all the provinces (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) serve thee. And that tree was exalted and neared the heaven, and its breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) touched the clouds. Thou, O king, wast exalted above all men that are upon the face of the whole earth, and thine heart has been [literally, 'was'] lifted up with pride and strength over those things which pertain to the Holy One and his angels, and thy works are manifest, because thou hast laid waste the house of the living God on account of the sins of the consecrated people." The latter portion of this contains plain evidence of interpolation. Had there been anything of that sort in the original Daniel, it would not have disappeared from the Massoretic text. This addition reveals the mental attitude of the Jews of the Maccabean period to foreign oppressors. The fact that the whole atmosphere of the primitive Daniel differs so much from this is an indirect evidence of its genuineness. If one looks at the Septuagint rendering of these three verses, there seem evidences of an early origin. The first verse is clearly an instance in which the text behind the Septuagint is superior to that of the Massoretic; the latter is obviously filled out from ver. 11. The statement of Nebuchadnezzar's greatness in ver. 22 (14 Septuagint, 18 Massoretic) may be somewhat the result of paraphrase. The fifteenth verse, according to the LXX., which is paralleled by Tischeudorf with ver. 19 of the Massoretic, is really another version of the preceding verses, probably slightly modified to give the resulting text the appearance of being continuous. Theodotion bears a very close resemblance to the Massoretic text, only he has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "breadth," instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta differs but little, though still a little, from the Massoretic text. Instead of rendering, "meat for all," it has, "for all flesh." According to both recensions of the text, Daniel repeats, either in substance or with verbal exactness, the description Nebuchadnezzar had himself given of the tree of his vision, but applies it to the monarch. To us the terms of the description of Nebuchadnezzar's power are exaggerated; but we must bear in mind that the manners of an Oriental court are different from those of Western nations. It is not unlike the boastful language of Nebuchadnezzar in the Standard Inscription.
