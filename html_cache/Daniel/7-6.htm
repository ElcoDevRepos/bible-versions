The sudden appearance signifies the rapid rise of this kingdom, which aligns with historical accounts of swift conquests. The vision is part of a series of prophetic revelations given to Daniel, which symbolize successive empires that would dominate the ancient world.<p><b>It was like a leopard,</b><br>The leopard is known for its speed and agility, characteristics that symbolize the rapid expansion of the empire represented by this beast. Historically, this is often associated with the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great, who swiftly conquered vast territories.

This can be seen in the historical context of Alexander's campaigns, which were unprecedented in their speed and reach. The wings also imply divine enablement or permission for such rapid expansion.<p><b>The beast also had four heads,</b><br>The four heads are commonly interpreted as representing the division of Alexander's empire after his death. His kingdom was split among his four generals: Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy. This division is a significant historical event that aligns with the prophetic imagery, indicating a fragmented yet powerful rule.<p><b>and it was given authority to rule.</b><br>The phrase indicates that the beast's dominion was not self-derived but granted, suggesting divine sovereignty over the rise and fall of empires.

The flow of the chapter is sequential&#8212;one empire after another&#8212;underscoring how the Sovereign Lord &#8220;changes times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Suddenly another beast appeared</b><p>The phrase &#8220;another&#8221; follows the lion-like and bear-like beasts (<a href="/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4-5</a>), signaling the rise of a third world power. Just as the image&#8217;s third layer of bronze in <a href="/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a> pointed to a fresh kingdom, so this third beast introduces a new ruler on the world stage&#8212;Greece&#8212;arriving unexpectedly and decisively (<a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was like a leopard</b><p>Leopards are known for speed and stealth. Those traits mirror the lightning-quick conquests of Alexander the Great, who swept across the Near East in barely a decade. Scripture often uses the leopard to picture rapid movement (<a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>). Alexander&#8217;s army moved with such agility that, humanly speaking, resistance seemed futile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On its back it had four wings like those of a bird</b><p>Wings intensify the imagery of swiftness. Four wings suggest movement in every direction&#8212;north, south, east, and west&#8212;just as Greece&#8217;s armies spread across continents (<a href="/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a>). The blend of leopard and wings communicates God-ordained acceleration that surpassed ordinary human capability. <a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a> later borrows beastly features to describe future powers, reminding us that earthly kingdoms operate only within boundaries God permits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The beast also had four heads</b><p>Heads stand for ruling authorities. History records that after Alexander&#8217;s untimely death, his empire fractured into four major realms under his generals: Cassander (Macedonia), Lysimachus (Thrace/Asia Minor), Seleucus (Syria/Babylon), and Ptolemy (Egypt). Daniel foresaw this centuries in advance (<a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>; 11:4). God&#8217;s Word proves true down to the smallest detail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was given authority to rule</b><p>The passive voice&#8212;&#8220;was given&#8221;&#8212;highlights that ultimate authority belongs to God alone (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Even the most brilliant strategist gains power only by divine allowance (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). Greece&#8217;s season of dominance fit perfectly into God&#8217;s larger plan, preparing the world for the spread of the gospel in a common language (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> portrays the Greek Empire: swift as a leopard, supercharged by four wings, later divided among four heads, and granted authority by God. The verse assures believers that every empire rises and falls under the Lord&#8217;s watchful eye, reinforcing our confidence that His Word is accurate, literal, and completely trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">A leopard.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">a panther.</span> On the great vigilance and swiftness of the panther, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm" title="Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-7.htm" title="Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:">Hosea 13:7</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. The third beast corresponds to the copper belly and thighs of the image (Daniel 2). It should be noticed that as unity characterises the first beast, and duality the second, so quadruplicity marks the third. It has four wings--wings as of a bird, not of an eagle--by which a degree of swiftness is implied inferior to that of the first beast. It has four heads, indicating four kingdoms, into which the third kingdom should develop itself. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-8.htm" title="Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.">Daniel 8:8</a>, where the same predominance of the number "four" is to be observed.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it</span>. The LXX. rendering is shorter, "And after these things I saw another beast, like a leopard, and four wings stretched over it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and there were four heads to the beast." The grammar of this is difficult to understand. As it stands, it must be translated as above; if, however, we might read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, we should avoid the solecism of uniting a neuter plural to a plural verb, rendering, "and it stretched," etc. Paulus Tellensis renders as above, and adds a clause, "and a tongue was given to it" - a reading to all appearance due to the transposal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. It is difficult, on the present text, to explain how the LXX. rendered "wings of a fowl," "stretched over it." If, however, the original word were that used in the Peshitta, (<span class="accented">paehatha</span>), it is explicable that this should have been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta do not differ from the Massoretic text. The majority of critical commentators maintain this to be the Persian Empire. A leopard is a less animal than a bear, and therefore, according to the argument these critics used with regard to the second empire, it ought to mean that it symbolized a still smaller empire. That, however, is impossible. No Jew of the age of the Maccabees could have been under that impression. Moreover, we have the four wings declared to mean that the Persian power extended to all quarters of the world, and attention is directed to the fact that the statement is made concerning it, "dominion was given to it." This assumes, what would be admitted by everybody to be contrary to fact, had the critics not a further conclusion in view. The traditional interpretation is that the Hellenic Empire - that of Alexander the Great and his successors - is intended here. In defence of this we have the fact that four, as we have just said, is the numerical sign of the Greek power. In the following chapter we have the goat, with its one notable horn, which, on being broken off, is replaced by four. In the eleventh chapter we are told that Alexander's empire is to be divided to the four winds of heaven. But "wings" are not prophetically so much the symbol of extensive dominion, as of rapidity of movement. If Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>) is a great eagle with long wings, it is because of the rapidity of his conquests. Jeremiah says of his horses, they are "swifter than eagles." Again in Lamentations, "Our persecutors are swifter than eagles." Wings, then, symbolize swiftness of motion. If we turn to the next chapter, the swiftness of Alexander's conquests is the point that most impresses the seer. Swiftness, compared either with the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar or of Alexander, was not the characteristic of the Persian conquests. Cyrus, in the course of thirty years, had subdued Asia Minor, probably Armenia; had relieved Media, Elam, and Persia from the alien yoke of the Manda; and had conquered Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar, after the battle of Carehemish, had advanced to the river of Egypt. We do not know the extent and direction of his many campaigns, but rapidity of movement characterized some of them we do know, and Alexander's conquests were made with extreme rapidity.
