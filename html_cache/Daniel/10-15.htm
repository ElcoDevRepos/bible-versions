The context is a vision Daniel receives during the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia. The words spoken are part of a revelation concerning future events, including the struggles of Israel. This moment is significant as it highlights the divine communication between God and His prophets, a common theme throughout the Bible, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>I set my face toward the ground</b><br>Daniel's reaction of bowing his face to the ground is a sign of humility and reverence, common in biblical encounters with the divine or angelic beings. This posture is seen in other scriptural accounts, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). It reflects the overwhelming nature of divine presence and the human response of awe and submission.<p><b>and became speechless</b><br>Daniel's inability to speak signifies the profound impact of the vision and the message he is receiving. This mirrors other biblical instances where individuals are rendered speechless in the presence of divine revelation, such as Zechariah in <a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>. It underscores the theme of human limitation in the face of God's majesty and the weight of prophetic revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision.

The ongoing speech underscores that Daniel&#8217;s experience is not a fleeting impression but a sustained revelation straight from God&#8217;s throne (cf. <a href="/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes the power of heaven-sent words to overpower human strength&#8212;think of the disciples on the road to Emmaus who said, &#8220;Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Because every word of God proves true (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), Daniel&#8217;s immediate reaction validates both the authority and the literal accuracy of the revelation he is hearing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I set my face toward the ground</b><p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s posture signals reverence and submission. Like Ezekiel who &#8220;fell on [his] face&#8221; before the glory of the LORD (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>), Daniel acknowledges the infinite gap between the Creator and the creature.<p>&#8226; Bowing low is the instinctive response of saints who encounter divine majesty&#8212;Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe to me, for I am ruined!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and John &#8220;fell at His feet as though dead&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This humble stance also mirrors the call of <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>: &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.&#8221; Daniel&#8217;s lowered face anticipates God&#8217;s lifting him up in verse 18.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and became speechless</b><p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s inability to speak highlights human frailty when confronted with the supernatural. Job reached the same point: &#8220;I am unworthy&#8212;how can I reply to You? I put my hand over my mouth&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Silence before God is not emptiness but awe-filled worship (<a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>). Even Zechariah was rendered speechless until God&#8217;s word was fulfilled (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment foreshadows the promise that every mouth will one day be silenced before the righteous judgment of God (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>), reinforcing the seriousness of heaven&#8217;s message to Daniel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15</a> shows a faithful servant overwhelmed by the living word of God. The ongoing heavenly speech, Daniel&#8217;s face to the ground, and his loss of words collectively paint a vivid picture of reverent submission. The verse reminds us that when God speaks, the only fitting first response is humble, speechless awe, trusting that He will strengthen and raise up those who bow before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">I set my face</span>.--The conduct of Daniel described in this verse is not to be ascribed to his fear, for that had been already driven away (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm" title="Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.">Daniel 10:12</a>), but to his reverence for the majestic person who was before him, and to the gratitude that he felt for the answer to his prayer. (Comp. <a href="/context/daniel/9-3.htm" title="And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:">Daniel 9:3-4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> The versions agree with the above. <span class="accented">I set my face toward the ground</span> does not mean that Daniel again fell prostrate, but that his eyes naturally sought the ground. <span class="accented">And I became dumb.</span> Not to be regarded as equivalent to "I remained silent," though there is nothing in the narrative to indicate that Daniel had been speaking; he may have had the sensation of paralyzed vocal cords. Certainly the verb '<span class="accented">alam</span> means "to be dumb," although, as with ourselves, this phrase dots not mean always physiological dumbness, but simply a silence which, from <span class="accented">shyness</span> or fear, one is unable to break. This is the meaning the versions attach to it. The opinion we indicate finds support in the dumbness of Zacharias, the father of John Baptist, after Gabriel appeared to him, and, still more, in what is related in the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While he was speaking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(kad&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1447;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my face</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#257;&#183;nay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">toward the ground</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and became speechless.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ne&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_481.htm">Strong's 481: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tie fast, to be tongue-tied</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/10-15.htm">Daniel 10:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/10-15.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 10:15 And when he had spoken to me (Dan.
