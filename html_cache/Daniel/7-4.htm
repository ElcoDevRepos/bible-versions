The lion, known for its strength and majesty, is often associated with royalty and power. In the context of Daniel's vision, the lion likely represents the Babylonian Empire, known for its dominance and grandeur. The lion is a fitting symbol for Babylon, as it was a powerful and influential empire during Daniel's time.<p><b>and it had the wings of an eagle</b><br>The wings of an eagle suggest swiftness and the ability to conquer quickly. Eagles are known for their speed and keen vision, symbolizing the rapid expansion and far-reaching influence of the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar. The combination of a lion and eagle emphasizes the formidable nature of this kingdom.<p><b>I watched until its wings were torn off</b><br>The removal of the wings indicates a loss of power and mobility. Historically, this can be seen as a reference to the humbling of Nebuchadnezzar, as described in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, where his pride led to his downfall and temporary insanity. The tearing off of the wings signifies a divine intervention that limits the empire's reach and influence.<p><b>and it was lifted up from the ground</b><br>This phrase suggests a restoration or elevation from a fallen state. After Nebuchadnezzar's period of madness, he was restored to his throne, acknowledging the sovereignty of God. This lifting up symbolizes a return to power, but with a new understanding of divine authority.<p><b>and made to stand on two feet like a man</b><br>Standing on two feet like a man implies a transformation from a beastly nature to a more human-like state. This can be seen as a metaphor for Nebuchadnezzar's change in character after his humbling experience. It reflects a shift from arrogance to humility, recognizing the supremacy of God.<p><b>and given the mind of a man</b><br>Receiving the mind of a man indicates a change in understanding and perspective. In Nebuchadnezzar's case, it represents his acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and his subsequent rationality and wisdom. This transformation highlights the theme of divine sovereignty and the humbling of human pride, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The lion with eagle&#8217;s wings pictures the empire&#8217;s unparalleled strength and speed; the tearing off of the wings portrays God&#8217;s decisive judgment; the beast&#8217;s elevation to upright posture and a human mind reflects Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s personal humbling and restoration, and more broadly God&#8217;s sovereign power to raise up, abase, and transform rulers. The verse reassures believers that no empire, however fearsome, operates outside God&#8217;s control, and it invites all who wield influence&#8212;great or small&#8212;to walk humbly before the King of heaven who gives both power and the mind to use it rightly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The first was like a lion.--</span>The lion and the eagle are chosen as being emblems of strength and swiftness respectively.

We have not sufficient historical details respecting the last years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign to enable us to point to the reference. It has been suggested by St. Jerome that the words refer to the madness of the king and to his subsequent recovery; but it must be borne in mind that it is the kingdom rather than the king of Babylon which is the subject of the vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wing. thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it</span>. The LXX. and Theodotion render "lioness," but otherwise agree with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta does not differ from the received text. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> is epicene. It is, however, to be noted that in later Aramaic the terminal letter was <span class="aramaic">&#x5d0;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>. The word <span class="accented">gappeen</span>, "wings," is worthy of note; in this form it appears in the Peshitta, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> in Eastern Aramaic; <span class="accented">genappeen</span> is the Targumie form. No modern commentator has doubted, with, I think, the single exception of Dr. Bonnar ('Great Interregnum'), that the first beast here is the Babylonian Empire (Hitzig, Zockler, Kliefoth, etc.). Nebuchadnezzar is compared (<a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>) to a lion and to an eagle (<a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; also <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>), and suitable to this are the winged human-headed figures found in the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon. If we assume that the empire of Babylon is represented by this first beast, then we have to note, in the first place, the avoidance of any reference to numbers. It may be objected that the "eagle's wings," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">gappeen</span>), are in the dual. Yet the number two is not mentioned. That the word was in the dual in the pre-Massoretic text does not appear from the versions, so the correctness of the dual pointing may be doubted. Unity was the mark of the Babylonian Empire in the vision of Nebuchadnezzar, and unity still remains its numerical sign. As swiftness and aggressiveness are symbolized by wings, especially "eagle's wings," when we read, "I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked," we learn that before the fall of Babylon a period set in, during which Babylonia ceased to be the aggressive conquering power it had been. <span class="accented">A man's heart was given to it.</span> J.D. Michaelis thinks the reference here is to the fact that when they first broke from their original seats, the Chaldeans were barbarians, but they became civilized in Babylonia. We know more now of the early history of Babylon and of the Chaldeans, and know that at one time the latter were divided into many cantons, each under its separate king, and that on and after the conquest of Babylon by Merodach-Baladan, they became more able to act in concert. The circumstances connected with the accession of Nabopolassar are wrapped in mystery. However, it is clear this cannot be the reference here. The giving of the man's heart is brought into close relationship with the plucking of the wings. This fact also decides us against the view so generally maintained, that there is here a reference to the madness of Nebuchadnezzar. In his case the heart of a beast was given to a man; in the case before us the heart of a man is given to a beast. To us the contrast seems more obvious than the resemblance. Much superior is Calvin's interpretation. Speaking of the phrases, "set upon his feet," and "the heart of a man was given to him," Calvin says, "By these modes of speech one understands that the Assyrians and Chaldeans were reduced in rank - that now they were not like lions, but like men" (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/17-10.htm">2 Samuel 17:10</a>, "Whose heart is as the heart of a lion"). This is the view of Behrmann. There is no reference, then, to any supposed humanizing influences which manifested themselves in Babylonian methods of government after Nebuchadnezzar was restored to his reason. From being an empire that spread its wings over the earth, it became limited very much to Babylonia, if not at times to little more than the territory surrounding the city of Babylon. We find that Nabunahid felt himself ready to be overwhelmed by the encroaching Manda. He manifests nothing of lion-like courage or eagle-like swiftness of assault. This was the state of things when Daniel had this vision. Nabunahid was in Tema, while his son did his best to defend the frontier against the threatening encroachments of Cyrus. Hitzig and Havernick maintain that the attitude suggested by the phrase, "set upon its feet," is what, in heraldic language, is called "rampant;" it is possible, but it rather militates against the natural meaning of the words. Before leaving this, it must be noted that, as in the vision Nebuchadnezzar had of the statue, the symbol of the Babylonian Empire is the noblest metal - the head of gold. Here the noblest animal is the symbol of Babylon - "the lion." The same reason may be assigned here for this, as in the passage in the second chapter for that - that the Babylonian Empire had more in it of the symbol of Divine government. No monarch was more like a god to his subjects; his power was unchecked, unlimited, uncontrolled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The first [beast]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#7695;&#183;m&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6933.htm">Strong's 6933: </a> </span><span class="str2">Former, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was like a lion,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
