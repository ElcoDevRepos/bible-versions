In ancient Babylon, music played a significant role in religious and royal ceremonies. The variety of instruments mentioned reflects the grandeur and the diverse cultural influences within the Babylonian Empire. The use of music to signal worship underscores the orchestrated nature of the king's decree, emphasizing the pressure to conform.<p><b>if you are ready to fall down and worship the statue I have made, very good.</b><br>The statue represents King Nebuchadnezzar's attempt to consolidate power and unify his empire under one religion and one ruler. The act of falling down and worshiping signifies submission not only to the statue but to the king's authority. This demand for worship is a direct challenge to the exclusive worship of Yahweh, as commanded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>But if you refuse to worship, you will be thrown at once into the blazing fiery furnace.</b><br>The fiery furnace symbolizes the severe consequences of defying the king's command. Historically, such furnaces were used for smelting metals and could reach extremely high temperatures. This threat reflects the absolute power of the king and the harsh penalties for disobedience. It also sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power to save, as seen in the deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.<p><b>Then what god will be able to deliver you from my hands?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the power of any deity to save from the king's decree, highlighting Nebuchadnezzar's arrogance and belief in his own supremacy. It sets up a confrontation between the king's authority and the sovereignty of the God of Israel. This echoes other biblical narratives where God's power is demonstrated over earthly rulers, such as the Exodus story where God delivers Israel from Pharaoh's hand. This phrase foreshadows the miraculous deliverance that will affirm God's supremacy and faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who erected a golden statue and demanded worship from all his subjects.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shadrach,_meshach,_and_abednego.htm">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</a></b><br>Three Jewish men who were officials in Babylon and refused to worship the statue.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_statue.htm">The Golden Statue</a></b><br>A massive idol set up by Nebuchadnezzar, symbolizing his power and the gods of Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fiery_furnace.htm">The Fiery Furnace</a></b><br>A punishment method used by Nebuchadnezzar for those who disobeyed his decree.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where these events took place, known for its grandeur and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_under_pressure.htm">Faithfulness Under Pressure</a></b><br>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego exemplify unwavering faith in God despite severe consequences.

The last clause is rendered," but if not, know." It inserts the epithet "golden" after "image." The insertion of "know <span class="accented">ye"</span> makes the sentence run more easily, but it is not to be accepted. Here, as before, "midst" is omitted. Theodotion is very close to the Massoretic, but agrees with the Septuagint in its omission of "midst" and its insertion of "golden." The Peshitta is in yet closer agreement with the Massoretic text, save in regard to the musical instruments <span class="accented">- p'santerin</span>, as in the other cases, being omitted. It seems clear from this that the festival of the dedication of this new idol of the Babylonian king occupied several days. Nebuchadnezzar, willing to save those Jews, is ready to condone their first failure to obey his command if, probably at the sunrise of the following day, they were willing when they heard the sound of the musical instruments to fall down and worship this golden image which he had set up to the honour of his god. The latter clause does not seem in perfect harmony with the tone of the earlier part of the verse. There has been no reference in the conversation as reported to any other god to explain Nebuchadnezzar's demand, "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?" Moreover, there is in the beginning a desire apparent to give these Jewish officials a way of escape, but in the last clause there is contempt as well as anger expressed. The fact is that while the simple structure of Shemitic lends itself to direct narration, the reader is not to suppose that, though speeches are reported in the <span class="accented">oratio recta</span>, they any more record or claim to record the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> than if the speeches had been recorded in the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span> of more Western tongues. The presumption is that merely the main heads of the conversation are recorded. These very jolts and leaps are in themselves indirect evidences of the truth of the document with which we have to do. It would have been easy to insert a question and answer to bridge over the hiatus. Only one recording facts would be regardless of this. The attitude of mind expressed by these last words of Nebuchadnezzar are natural to a heathen, and especially to monarchs of the Assyrian type. Sennacherib's words of defiance (<a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>) are quite in the same line, "Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the King of Assyria?" The capture of Jerusalem by his arms was regarded by Nebuchadnezzar as a demonstration that the God of Israel was inferior to the gods of Babylonia. To Nebuchadnezzar this belief would not in the slightest degree contradict his previous declaration (<a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>), that this same God was "a God of gods, and a Lord of kings." He might be great as a Revealer of secrets, but not in might to deliver - in that he was clearly inferior to the gods of Babylon, as the events of recent campaigns had abundantly proved. It is this declaration, with the idea behind it of the ]imitation of Jehovah, that gives the event narrated in this chapter its importance. <span class="accented">Excursus on the Musical Instruments in this Chapter.</span> The names of the musical instruments which occur in the fifth, seventh, tenth, and fifteenth verses of this chapter are supposed to afford a demonstrative proof of the late date of Daniel. Thus Canon Driver, by no means an extreme critic, declares that, while "the Hebrew and Aramaic permit" a late date, these Greek words "demand" that the date of Daniel be placed as late as the period of the Syrian power. The words in question <span class="accented">are - qathros</span>, <span class="accented">pesanterin</span>, <span class="accented">sum-phonya.</span> The first of these, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">qath'ros</span>), appears to be transferred from the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), from its resemblance to the older form, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in Homer: we may deduce that the word, if borrowed from the Greek, was borrowed at an early period. Canon Driver would not, in view of the intercourse between Greece and Babylon, press this word as proof of the recent date of Daniel. The intercourse between Babylon and Greece was sufficiently great to have rendered the conveyance of this name at least not impossible. It has been shown, moreover, by Professor Whitehouse, that the word is probably derived from the East; indeed, he fixes on Phoenicia as its source. It must be observed that he maintains that, while originally Phoenician, the form it assumes in Daniel proves it to have come to the author of Daniel from Greek The word may have been modified from its more ancient to its more recent form, for the sake of readers. One of the suggestions of those who oppose the antiquity of the Book of Daniel is that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kinnor</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the word that would have been used by a genuine Aramaic writer of Daniel's period, as <span class="accented">kinder</span> and <span class="accented">qitharos</span> (or <span class="accented">qathros</span>) represent one and the same instrument; but, unfortunately for this, in the Peshitta we have both terms, the one after the other. The other words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">pesanterin</span>), supposed to be equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, are on a different footing. In the first place, any one who has studied the apocalyptic writings, must see how peculiarly liable they are to interpolation. There is hardly one that is not largely and obviously interpolated. No one can deny that this has taken place with. Daniel. The apocryphal additions are too well known for any one to maintain the opposite opinion. When, moreover, one begins to compare the Massoretic text with the more ancient versions, the Septuagint, the Peshitta, and that of Theodotion, we at once see that the changes which the text has undergone have not been confined to large interpolations, but all through there are words and phrases where the versions differ from the Massoretic text and from each other. The text especially from which the Septuagint translation has been made, must have presented many and important verbal differences from that adopted by the Massoretes. Even Theodotion, though his version agrees more closely with the Massoretic text than does the Septuagint, differs from it in ways and in a degree than can at times be explained only on the supposition that the text before him was not identical with that adopted by the Massoretes. The supposition that Theodotion has been altered from the Septuagint has been hazarded, and in a few cases it may have some semblance of probability, but in other cases it is destitute of every shadow of likelihood. The Peshitta is another source of various readings. Its variations are independent of either of the other two versions. In some chapters these variations are more marked than in others, but in every case they are numerous enough to make any stress on individual words highly hazardous. While these variations are known and chronicled, there is no security that no variations occurred even before the types of the text separated from each other. In such a case as this, although it would be unscientific, on the ground of this uncertainty, to proceed to change the text to what seems to make better sense, it is equally unscientific to lay any evidential weight on single words. But, further, no words are, in one respect, less evidential than musical terms. They are changed and modified with a freedom applied to few other things. Thus we have "cornet-a-piston" figuring also as "cornopean," two words like each other in sound, of the same meaning, but of widely different derivation. They pass from country to country with greater freedom than most other terms. To infer, then, that the writer of Daniel wrote under Greek domination, because certain Greek musical terms occur in the present Massoretic text, is rash in the extreme, and would, it seems to us, be universally regarded so, were there not an object to be gained by assuming that evidence drawn from them was liable to no doubt. New Testament critics have taught us to suspect what are called <span class="accented">tendenz</span> documents, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> documents that have an overweening bias towards one side of a controversy: there is such a thing as a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> judgment. The judgment of the critics in regard to the evidential value of these musical terms is a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> judgment, which we should say is even more to be suspected than the contents of a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> document. The history of the argument from the alleged presence of Greek terms in Daniel is also instructive. The number of Greek terms that Hitzig and some earlier critics saw was large. Gradually they had to abandon all but those coming in the list of musical instruments here. Of these only four could be claimed as really Greek. However, one of these had soon to go, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>; it was maintained to be derived from the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. It was found that this Greek word was really derived from an Eastern, probably an Assyrian, source. Next, it has been acknowledged by Canon Driver, as above stated, that much stress cannot be laid on <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), seeing it is an instrument of such ancient date in Greece, that it might easily have drifted eastward, name and thing, to Babylon. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the word, in all probability, is not Greek, to begin with, but Eastern, probably Phoenician. In regard to the remaining words <span class="accented">- sumphonya</span> and <span class="accented">pesanterin -</span> it is argued that they are of Greek origin, and that, while Babylonian intercourse with Greece is not denied, the origin of these words is maintained to be late, at all events, in the sense in which they appear in this passage. Thus, <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is declared to be the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and it is further said that <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is not a term applied to musical instruments till late, Aristotle and Theophrastus being the earliest authors that use the word. That this word <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is supposed to be proved by an argument which shows that the Greek letter <span class="greek">&#x3c8;</span> is resolved, in passing into Aramaic, into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span>; second, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> may be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, and that <span class="accented">-</span><span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> becomes not infrequently <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> Even though all these points be admitted, it does not follow that <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is derived from <span class="accented">psalterion</span>; as fair a case might be made out for deriving "mystery" from "mist" While <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> sometimes represents -<span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it much more frequently is simply the sign of the plural; and while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;</span> may be at times the first half of <span class="greek">&#x3c8;</span> resolved, it also does represent at times the Coptic article <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>. While it is not impossible that <span class="accented">santer</span> may represent the remaining letters of the name of the Greek instrument, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> has a meaning in Coptic also; it may mean a chorus <span class="accented">-</span> "those singing to an instrument." This, then, would show that <span class="accented">pesanter</span>,'<span class="accented">n</span> might mean those singing in accompaniment to the previously named instruments. Confirmatory of this is the fact that in Lower Egypt, at the present day, there is a musical instrument called the <span class="accented">santeer.</span> When one remembers the great intercourse that existed between Assyria and Egypt when Esarhaddon and Asshur-bani-pal held possession of Egypt - the former of whom frequently held his court in Babylon - that Egyptian words should come into Babylon would not be extraordinary. We admit readily that possibility is not proof of actuality, yet it weakens the force of the other argument, which also is merely from possibility. A prior question has to be settled before we deduce anything from the origin of this word <span class="accented">pesanteria.</span> Is it really part of the original text? There are in this third chapter of Daniel four distinct lists of what purport to be musical instruments. And these are arranged in such a way that the reader expects them to be identical. Each of these may thus be regarded as separate manuscripts. We have further three old versions, as already mentioned, as well as the Massoretic text: the Septuagint dated about <span class="date">B.C. 200</span>; Theodotion and the Peshitta, dated about A.D. ; the Massoretic text, being fixed somewhere about A.D. , and represented by manuscripts, the earliest of which is of the tenth century - the Qri and K'thib represent two forms of reading. Of these authorities the latest is the Massoretic text. To begin with the Massoretic text, the first thing that meets us is that, while in the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth verses, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, in the seventh verse it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. This is not so insignificant as at first sight seems, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;</span> do not appear to have been pronounced in the same way originally, any more than the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b8;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;</span>. But further, it is an acknowledged canon of criticism that when a passage has many variations of reading in different manuscripts, that itself raises a suspicion that it has come from the margin into the text. This variation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> in a word is an instance similar to that of varying words in the case of a passage; a varying letter is, in the case of a word, a note conveying suspicion. When we turn to the versions, we find that while the Greek - the Septuagint and Theodotion - have it, the word is quite omitted from the Syriac Peshitta. If it had dropped into the text from the margin, it would be most likely to do so in the Greek versions first, and then find its way into the Massoretic text afterwards. Hence the positive value of the evidence of the Greek versions is comparatively small, although their negative value is considerable. On the other hand, the word is not present at all in the Peshitta, which originated beyond the sphere of Greek domination. That being the state of the matter, we venture to maintain that the word <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> does not belong to the genuine text of Daniel. The case against <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is yet stronger. In regard to this word there is a divergence between the Q'ri and the K'thib. Hence we may regard this as a case in which we have twenty manuscripts. If we now examine the evidence supplied by these, we shall find that the evidence for the presence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> in the original text is very weak. In the K'thib, which represents in general the better text, we have <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> only in two cases, in one case we have <span class="accented">siphonya</span>, in the fourth case nothing at all. In the Q'ri we have three cases of <span class="accented">sumpboaya.</span> When we turn to the Greek texts, we find that <span class="accented">symphonia</span> occurs in the Septuagint in two cases, in Theodotion only in one case. When we turn to the Peshitta, we have no case of <span class="accented">sumphonia</span>, but we have in all cases <span class="accented">tsiphoaia</span>, a form akin to what we find in the tenth verse in the Massoretic text. If, then, we take these various cases together, and sum them up, we lind eight cases of <span class="accented">symphonia</span>, five cases of <span class="accented">siphonia</span>, and seven cases of nothing at all. As the word as we have it now is distinctly Greek, the evidence of the Greek versions, while strong negatively, is weak positively. We mean by this that a Greek word put on the margin might easily slip into the text of the Septuagint, and thence into the Palestinian recension - the Massoretic. Moreover, the case against <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is strengthened when we compare the instances in which it occurs with those in which it does not occur. If we looked at the matter <span class="accented">apriori</span>, the cases where a word would most likely be dropped is in a conversational repetition of such a list of instruments. But the best supported case of the occurrence of this word is in the offer made by Nebuchadnezzar, that if even yet they would yield, they would be forgiven. The word in question occurs here in the two texts represented by the Massoretic in the Septuagint and Theodotion. It does not appear in the Peshitta - its place being represented by <span class="accented">tzipbonia</span>, as we said above. On the other hand, the place where we might most readily find a marginal note like <span class="accented">sumphonia</span> is precisely the last occurrence of a frequently recurring list. But, again, the place where we should most certainly expect to find every word of such a list given with scrupulous exaetness, is what purports to be the record of a proclamation. But in Theodotion the word in question is not present in his record of the proclamation. In the seventh verse, where the proclamation is repeated to show the obedience it received, the word <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is absent in the Massoretic text and the versions. Further, next to the record of a proclamation in likelihood for an accurate repetition of all the words of such a list, is, where a case is being founded on this proclamation. This, again, is a case in which <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> does not occur save in the Q'ri. When those who are about to accuse to Nebuchadnezzar the three Hebrews, repeat to him his proclamation, according to the Greek versions they leave out the word before us altogether, according to the K'thib and Peshitta they insert another word altogether. To us the argument seems conclusive that the word in question was not part of the original text of Daniel. We cannot leave this question without adverting to some other aspects of it. The intercourse between the Hellenic peoples and Assyria seems to have been considerable We know from Strabo, 13:2. 3, under the title of Lesbos, that Antimenidas, the brother of the poet Alcaeus, was in the Babylonian army at the time when Nebuchadnezzar was king. Strabo quotes Alcaeus, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "fought along with the Babylonians as their ally." The Assyrians possessed Cyprus - another source of Hellenic influence. The later Sargonids, Esarhaddon and Asshur-bani-pal, those who had the closest relationship with Babylon, had also the supremacy in Egypt, and now we know from Flinders Petrie and others, in the accounts they have given us of their explorations at Dapine, that there was, before the time of the Babylonian power, a Greek colony of old standing. To meet this contention it is urged that the words in question are much later than the time of Nebuchadnezzar. Certainly we shall admit that the earliest instance of <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is in Aristotle, but the date of the word is not to be limited by its occurrence in Aristotle (Arist., 'Problem.,' 19:23. 2). It occurs in a definition of a <span class="accented">trigon</span> as a triangular psaltery - a mode of speech which implies that "psaltery" was already relatively a common designation. We could not define a "trichord" as a piano in which each note was produced by three wires of the same length stretched to the same degree of tension - unless pianos were comparatvely common. That it does not occur earlier is probably due to the word beginning possibly as a localism, and then becoming common in literature. Thus many of the phrases denounced as recent Americanisms are proved by more careful investigation to be old provincialisms that have attained literary rank, or at all events semi-literary rank, in a new country. Hence, even though it were proved that <span class="accented">psanterin</span> is of Greek origin, and that it belongs to the original text of Daniel, which is more than doubtful, it would yet be no great strain to imagine the name and the instrument had passed over to Babylon before the traditional date of Daniel. The case for <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is even weaker. Even should it be granted to be in the text of Daniel, and further that it is a Greek word, it is not an instrument until at all events a much later date than any one pretends Daniel to have been written. Yet Canon Driver lays the main stress of his argument on the fact that in the passage before us it means an instrument, and in this view he is supported by Mr. Bevan. The whole stress of this statement really depends on a passage in Polybius (Polyb., 26:10), in which it is alleged the word in question means a musical instrument of some sort. The view that the word before us in the passage means a musical instrument can only be maintained on reading the word preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and on the further assumption that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a musical instrument, of which there is no proof. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> means not only the horn of an animal, but also a musical horn; it is also true that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the diminutive from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; but it is not to be assumed that all the senses of the original word are retained by the diminutive. A "lance" is the name given both to a medical instrument and to a weapon used by cavalry: it does not follow from this that since "a lancet" is a medical instrument, it is also a military weapon. There is certainly no instance to support the assertion t,,at there ever was such a usage. As naturally it might be used of a drinking-horn. If the reading <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is adopted, the meaning assigned to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> loses even the limited plausibility it had. This view was presented years ago by Dr. Pusey, yet Canon Driver and Professor Bevan have repeated their exploded statements without the faintest attempt at answering the counter-arguments. Were any defender of Daniel to be guilty of anything similar, his ignorance would be sneered at, and his arguments hustled out of court. But there is a further question - Is <span class="accented">siphonia</span> the same word as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>? That the <span class="accented">m</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;</span>) <span class="accented">might</span> disappear and the <span class="accented">upsilon</span> of the Greek <span class="accented">might be</span> represented by <span class="accented">yod</span> in Aramaic, is not impossible, but the fact that, on the one side, there is the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, on the other there is the Eastern Aramaic word <span class="accented">tzgphonia</span>, throws grave doubt on this. With regard to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>, Strack ('Lehrbuch,' p. 15) declares that it is interchanged <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> before <span class="accented">t</span> sounds, and at the end of words; from this we deduce that <span class="accented">tziphonia</span> cannot be derived etymologie-ally from <span class="accented">sumphonya.</span> On the other hand, <span class="accented">siphonya</span> may readily be the product of <span class="accented">tzi-phonia</span>, through the intervention of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">suph</span>), "a reed." Changes otherwise impossible are rendered possible when they lead to a word with an intelligible sound. There is a verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>, both Chaldee and Hebrew, which, however, does not seem to have any close connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>, "a reed," or to have any musical meaning. It is used in Biblical Chaldee for the fulfilment of a prophecy (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>), in Targumic Chaldee "to have an end," "to cease" (Onkelos, <a href="/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>). The same verb with the same meaning occurs in Syriac (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>). This is an additional evidence that <span class="accented">tziphonia is</span> the original form of the word. In transferring the word to Chaldee, they gave it a form intelligible to those who used that tongue. If Syriac were the language in which Daniel was written, then the meaning of the word in that language is important. Castelli - on what authority we know not - gives the meaning of <span class="accented">tzephonya</span>, a word all but identical with that before us, as <span class="accented">tibia</span>, <span class="accented">tuba.</span> Altogether, not only is the genuineness of the word extremely doubtful, but even were it granted that there was a word there, it is not at all certain that it was a word connected with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. As the assailants of the authenticity of Daniel have laid the great stress of their argument on these words, and, as we have seen, these words afford but dubious evidence, we may consider ourselves to have a right to demand from them to abandon their opposition, or show reason why they do not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3705.htm">Strong's 3705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2006.htm">Strong's 2006: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, there, less, whether, but, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are ready,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7791;&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6263.htm">Strong's 6263: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prepared</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1441;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;id&#183;d&#257;&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
