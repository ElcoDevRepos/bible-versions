The rest is farily in accordance with the Massoretic. It is clear that in the text before the LXX. translator the word was <span class="accented">shephattanoo</span> instead of <span class="accented">shephatoonoo</span>, that is to say, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tau</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>). These letters in earlier scripts were liable to be confounded. The meaning assigned to <span class="accented">shaphat</span> in this reading is unusual; but this is rather in favour of it being the true reading; and the return to the second person, while awkward, also has weight. Theodotion and the Peshitta do not call for remark. The use of the word "judges" for rulers generally ought to be noted. If we take the Massoretic reading, there may be a reminiscence of <a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>. Among the Carthaginians the principal magistrates bore the title <span class="accented">suffetes</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">shopheteen. Under the whole heaven hath not been done as bath been done upon Jerusalem.</span> Such language is to be regarded in any case as the exaggeration of grief; but it would have something like a justification twice in the history of Jerusalem, and only twice - after the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and after its capture by Titus. No one has maintained that the origin of Daniel is so late as the latter event; hence we are thrown back upon the former. With the fact before him that temples had been plundered everywhere, and desecrated, and cities sacked, the writer could not have regarded the case of Jerusalem, and its temple, in the days of Epiphanes, as unique under all heaven. After the capture of Jerusalem by. Nebuchadnezzar, the temple was left in rums and the city deserted. Such measure, so far as we know, was not meted out by Nebuchadnezzar to any other city. Only rarely had even the Ninevite monarchs taken such terrible vengeance on rebellious subjects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have carried out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1511;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;qem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
