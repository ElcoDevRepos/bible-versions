This phrase indicates the transition from recounting the dream to explaining its meaning. The dream itself, involving a statue made of various metals, symbolizes successive kingdoms. Daniel's ability to recount the dream without prior knowledge demonstrates divine revelation, emphasizing God's sovereignty and wisdom.<p><b>now we will tell the king</b><br>The use of "we" may refer to Daniel and his companions, who prayed for God's revelation, or it could be a humble way of including God in the process. Daniel's approach shows respect and confidence, acknowledging that the interpretation comes from God. This moment highlights the importance of divine guidance in understanding mysteries, a theme prevalent throughout the book of Daniel.<p><b>its interpretation.</b><br>The interpretation of the dream is crucial as it reveals God's plan for future empires and the eventual establishment of His eternal kingdom. The dream's interpretation serves as a prophecy, foretelling the rise and fall of kingdoms, culminating in God's unshakeable kingdom. This prophecy is significant in biblical eschatology and is often linked to other prophetic scriptures, such as those in Revelation. The interpretation also prefigures Christ as the ultimate King whose kingdom will never be destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew prophet and wise man in the Babylonian court, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to Daniel's involvement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and as a place of exile for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Nebuchadnezzar, which Daniel is about to interpret, concerning the future kingdoms of the world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_interpretation.htm">The Interpretation</a></b><br>The explanation of the dream's symbolism, which Daniel provides, revealing God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream underscores God's control over history and His power to reveal mysteries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Daniel's role in Babylon demonstrates how believers can remain faithful and influential even in a foreign and challenging environment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy serves to reveal God's plans and purposes, encouraging believers to trust in His ultimate plan for the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_discernment.htm">Wisdom and Discernment</a></b><br>Daniel's discernment and wisdom in handling the situation with Nebuchadnezzar highlight the importance of seeking God's guidance in difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_to_speak_truth.htm">Courage to Speak Truth</a></b><br>Daniel's willingness to speak the truth to power, even at personal risk, is a model for believers to stand firm in their convictions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_36_God_s_rule_over_kingdoms.htm">How does Daniel 2:36 demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and rulers?

It is scarcely a variation when the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, "to," instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "before," that is to say, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">qedam</span>).

Having finished telling Nebuchadnezzar his dream, Daniel now announces his intention of giving the interpretation. Commentators have noticed the fact that Daniel does not say, "I will give," but "we." The opinion of Professor Fuller is that Daniel here includes with himself his three companions; of Keil, Kranichfeld, Zockler, and Behrmann, that he identifies himself with all worshippers of Jehovah; Aben Ezra makes the plurality by making him refer to himself and the Divine wisdom; Jephet-ibn-Ali makes its force lie in contrast; Hitzig makes it really the <span class="accented">pluralis excellintiae</span>, and quotes in defence <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a> and Genesis 11:7, where it is God himself that speaks. Had Daniel introduced the phrase, "thus saith the Lord," this opinion might have been defended. It may be that Daniel fell back on the methods and ordinary mode of address for an astrologer before the King of Babylon (see ver 7). He does not wait for the king to acknowledge that this is the dream he had. Daniel at once pro-coeds with the interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the dream;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;el&#183;m&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2493.htm">Strong's 2493: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now we will tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_560.htm">Strong's 560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, tell, command</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its interpretation.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;i&#353;&#183;r&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6591.htm">Strong's 6591: </a> </span><span class="str2">An interpretation</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/2-36.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 2:36 This is the dream (Dan.
