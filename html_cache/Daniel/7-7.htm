Night visions are significant in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a> and <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>, where God communicates important messages. Daniel's role as a prophet is emphasized here, as he receives insight into future events through these visions.<p><b>suddenly a fourth beast appeared, and it was terrifying&#8212;dreadful and extremely strong</b><br>The fourth beast represents a powerful kingdom, often interpreted as the Roman Empire due to its unparalleled strength and influence in history. The description of the beast as "terrifying" and "dreadful" underscores the fearsome nature of this empire, which was known for its military prowess and expansive control. This aligns with the historical context of Rome's dominance and its impact on the ancient world.<p><b>with large iron teeth</b><br>The iron teeth symbolize the strength and destructive power of this kingdom. Iron, a strong and durable metal, is also mentioned in <a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>, where it represents the Roman Empire in Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The use of iron highlights the empire's ability to crush and dominate its enemies, reflecting its historical reputation for military might and efficiency.<p><b>It devoured and crushed; then it trampled underfoot whatever was left</b><br>This phrase illustrates the comprehensive and ruthless nature of the empire's conquests. The imagery of devouring and crushing suggests total domination and destruction, leaving nothing unscathed. Historically, the Roman Empire was known for its ability to assimilate and control vast territories, often leaving a lasting impact on the cultures it conquered.<p><b>It was different from all the beasts before it</b><br>The uniqueness of the fourth beast indicates a distinct nature compared to previous empires. This difference could refer to the Roman Empire's unprecedented reach and influence, as well as its complex political structure. Unlike the empires before it, Rome's governance and legal systems had a lasting influence on Western civilization, setting it apart in history.<p><b>and it had ten horns</b><br>The ten horns are often interpreted as ten kings or kingdoms that arise from this empire, as explained in <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>, where ten kings receive authority for a short time. The horns symbolize power and authority, suggesting a division of power within the empire or a future coalition of rulers. This aspect of the vision points to the prophetic nature of Daniel's message, indicating events that extend beyond the immediate historical context.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The distinguishing feature of it is the power which it possesses of breaking and stamping out all that it meets. In this way it corresponds to "iron that breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things." (Comp. <a href="/daniel/2-40.htm" title="And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.">Daniel 2:40</a>.) The description of the destructive might of this beast is heightened by the mention of "iron teeth" and "brazen claws." It should be noticed that the horns imply strength, while the ten horns correspond to the ten toes of the image.<p><span class= "bld">The residue--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, what it did not destroy with its teeth it trampled upon and annihilated with its feet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span> The version of the LXX. differs considerably, though not essentially, "After these things I beheld in a night vision a fourth terrible beast, and the fear of it excelled in strength; it had great iron teeth, it devoured and pounded down; it trode round about with its feet; it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns, and many counsels were in its horns." The sense of this does not really differ, save in the last clause, which seems to belong to the next verse. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only by having" after these things," following the LXX., instead of "after this." The identification of the empire intended by this beast has been the <span class="accented">crux</span> of interpreters. Practically all ancient authorities - Josephus, and the author of the Apocalypse of Baruch being among the number - maintain the Roman Empire to be meant. On the other hand, a very large number of modern critics, not merely of the exclusively critical school, have held that it refers either to the Greek Empire as a whole, or to the Seleucid portion of it. As we shall discuss this subject in a separate excursus, we shall at present look at the principles to be adopted in dealing with such a question. The important point is the numerical note of this "beast." It is "ten" - the same it may be remarked, as in the feet of the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream. When we turn from the Apocalypse of the Old Testament to the Apocalypse of the New, we find "ten" the note of Rome. Even though we should put this to the one side, as merely the opinion of an apostle, and therefore not to be considered at all in comparison with that of Hitzig or Von Lengerke, yet he was writing little more than a couple of centuries from the time when, according to critics, Daniel was written; moreover, he was in the direct line of apocalyptic tradition. The Apocalypse of Baruch, written in all probability <span class="date">B.C. 60</span>, has the same view, and it is separated by little more than a century from the time of the Maccabees. The Fourth Book of Esdras, written about A.D. , has the same view. All three books imply that it is the universally received opinion. This view is really the only one that fairly meets the case. The view which separates the Seleucid Empire from that of Alexander may be laid aside, although the first three empires are correctly interpreted, because it is directly controverted by the statement that this fourth empire is to be diverse from all that had gone before. The empire of the Seleucids was in no sense diverse from that of Alexander. This fourth empire was to be stronger than all that had gone before. The Seleucid Empire was notoriously and obviously less powerful than the empire of Alexander had been, and was merely a match for the empire of the Ptolemies. Further, the next chapter shows that the writer of Daniel regarded the empire of the Diadochi as really a continuation of that of Alexander the Great. The other view rests on a division between the Median and the Persian empires, which is contradicted by any fair interpretation of this book. The next chapter shows clearly that the writer regarded the Medo-Persian power as one, but as having two dominant races. The" great iron teeth" of the beast have a reference to the iron legs of the dream-image which appeared to Nebuchadnezzar. This beast "is diverse from all the beasts that were before it." In all the previous empires, the constitution was avowedly monarchical. With the Roman, the republican constitution appeared, and even under the emperors the forms of that constitution were preserved. In this sense it was diverse from all the preceding empires. Mr. Bevan thinks "the actrocious massacres at Tyro and elsewhere, by which Alexander en-deavoured to strike terror into the conquered races," is symbolized by the monster "devouring, crushing," etc. Mr. Bevan must never have read the accounts of the conquests of Asshur-bani-pal. He seems to have forgotten the treatment meted out to Samos and Miletus by the Persians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7791;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_870.htm">Strong's 870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A place, after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1436;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;w&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become, come to pass, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">watched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;z&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2370.htm">Strong's 2370: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze upon, mentally to dream, be usual</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7717;ez&#183;w&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
