Historically, this reflects the period of the Hellenistic kingdoms following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. The Seleucid Empire, often associated with the "king of the North," frequently engaged in large-scale military campaigns. The size of the army underscores the significant resources and manpower available, typical of the era's major powers.<p><b>he will stir up his power and his courage</b><br>The act of stirring up power and courage suggests a deliberate and strategic preparation for battle. This reflects the aggressive and ambitious nature of the Seleucid rulers, particularly Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who is often identified with the "king of the North." The phrase also implies a psychological readiness, emphasizing the leader's determination and resolve.<p><b>against the king of the South</b><br>The "king of the South" typically refers to the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. The ongoing conflict between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms, known as the Syrian Wars, is a historical backdrop for this passage. These wars were characterized by territorial disputes and power struggles, with both sides vying for control over the Levant and other strategic regions.<p><b>who will mobilize a very large and powerful army</b><br>This mirrors the earlier description of the northern king's forces, highlighting the formidable nature of the Ptolemaic military. The Ptolemies, like their Seleucid counterparts, had access to vast resources and could field significant armies. This balance of power sets the stage for a major confrontation, typical of the era's geopolitical dynamics.<p><b>but will not withstand the plots devised against him</b><br>Despite the strength of the Ptolemaic army, internal and external plots undermine their efforts. This could refer to political intrigue, betrayal, or strategic miscalculations. Historically, the Ptolemaic kingdom faced internal strife and external pressures, which often weakened their position. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder of the limitations of human power and the sovereignty of divine plans, as seen in other biblical narratives where God&#8217;s purposes prevail despite human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a ruler from the Seleucid Empire, historically associated with the region north of Israel.

The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; God knows and directs history down to motives, army sizes, and secret plots.<p>&#8226; Human courage and numbers are insufficient safeguards without divine favor.<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s prophecies are trustworthy, encouraging believers to rest in the Lord who rules kings, battles, and the unseen strategies that decide them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The south.--</span>Here, for the first time in the second portion of the prophecy, mention is made of the southern king. It is highly probable that the deceit mentioned in the last three verses had this king and his provinces for its object. This and the next two verses are supposed to describe the war of Antiochus with Ptolemy Philometor (see <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-16.htm" title="Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms.">1 Maccabees 1:16-19</a>), or his war with Physcon, on which see Livy. xliv. 19.<p><span class= "bld">His power and his courage--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, his military skill as well as his personal energy.<p><span class= "bld">But he shall not stand.--</span>Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-4.htm" title="I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.">Daniel 8:4</a>. The subject is the king of the south, who finds the devices of his opponent are more than a match for him. The "devices are explained in the next two verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him</span>. The versions present no point of remark, save that, instead of "king of the south," the Septuagint has, as usual, "the King of Egypt." This is supposed to be a compendious account of the second of the wars waged by Epipbanes against Egypt; but it suits the first better. At this time the Romans had declared war against Perseus, King of Macedon, and Antiochus, finding that they did not conquer Macedon easily, regarded the opportunity a suitable one for assailing Egypt and wresting from Ptolemy Philometor Coele-Syria, which his father had given as dower with Cleopatra, his daughter. The state of Egypt presented an aspect eminently hopeful to an assailant. The court of Egypt was full of intrigue and treachery; the centre of intrigue was the brother of the king, Ptolemy, nicknamed Physeon. The king, Ptolemy, was young; his generals, however, took up the challenge, and set on the field a large army; but the army was defeated, and Antiochus advanced as far as Memphis. Ptolemy was taken prisoner by his uncle, and Physeon his brother ascended the throne. The defeat of Philometor was supposed to be largely due to treachery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And with a large</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1419.htm">Strong's 1419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, older, insolent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
