The historical context involves the ongoing conflict between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom. The "strife" indicates the continuation of hostilities and power struggles that characterized the Hellenistic period following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. This strife is part of the larger narrative of conflict between the North and South kingdoms, which is a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>and assemble a great army</b><br>The assembling of a great army signifies the preparation for significant military campaigns. Historically, Antiochus III, known for his military prowess, gathered substantial forces to reclaim territories lost to the Ptolemies. This reflects the historical reality of the period, where large armies were often mobilized for territorial expansion and control. The emphasis on a "great army" underscores the scale and seriousness of the conflict.<p><b>which will advance forcefully, sweeping through like a flood</b><br>The imagery of advancing "like a flood" suggests an overwhelming and unstoppable military campaign. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe powerful invasions (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>). Antiochus III's campaigns were marked by rapid and decisive movements, reclaiming territories in the Levant. The flood imagery conveys the idea of a force that is both destructive and difficult to resist, highlighting the might and determination of Antiochus's forces.<p><b>and will again carry the battle as far as his fortress</b><br>The "fortress" likely refers to a strategic stronghold or city, possibly in the region of Coele-Syria, which was a contested area between the Seleucids and Ptolemies. The phrase indicates a renewed effort to push the battle lines to key defensive positions. This reflects the historical back-and-forth nature of the Seleucid-Ptolemaic conflicts, where control of fortresses and cities was crucial for maintaining power. The mention of "again" suggests previous attempts or successes in reaching this point, emphasizing the persistent nature of these military campaigns.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_sons.htm">His Sons</a></b><br>Refers to the sons of the king of the North, likely the successors of Seleucus II, who were involved in the ongoing conflicts between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_army.htm">Great Army</a></b><br>The military force assembled by the sons of the king of the North, indicating a significant and powerful military campaign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/irresistible_flood.htm">Irresistible Flood</a></b><br>A metaphor describing the overwhelming and unstoppable advance of the army, suggesting both the size and the force of the military campaign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_fortress.htm">His Fortress</a></b><br>Refers to the stronghold or defensive position of the opposing king, likely the king of the South, representing the Ptolemaic Kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/war_and_battle.htm">War and Battle</a></b><br>The ongoing conflict between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms, part of the larger series of wars known as the Syrian Wars.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize the historical context of biblical prophecies and how they relate to God's overarching plan.

The phrase points to an aggressive, relentless push (cf. <a href="/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>, &#8220;breaks open the way&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word assures believers that even fierce advances remain under divine oversight (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sweeping through like a flood</b><p>&#8226; The imagery of flood portrays an unstoppable surge (cf. <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7&#8211;8</a>).

Antiochus III pressed all the way to the Egyptian fortress at Raphia near Gaza, the frontier of Ptolemaic power.<p>&#8226; Fortress imagery recalls earlier northern strongholds (<a href="/daniel/11-7.htm">Daniel 11:7</a>) and God&#8217;s ultimate fortress for His people (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Antiochus initially succeeds, later verses show the ebb-and-flow of conquests, demonstrating that no earthly stronghold is impregnable when God decrees change (<a href="/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10</a> forecasts, in striking detail, the determination of Seleucus II&#8217;s sons to reignite war, the mustering of a massive army, its forceful advance, the overwhelming nature of that advance, and its reach to the enemy&#8217;s fortress. History confirms each step, showcasing Scripture&#8217;s perfect accuracy. The verse reminds believers that while kingdoms clash and floods of warfare sweep the earth, God&#8217;s sovereign plan unfolds exactly as He declared, inviting us to trust Him above every human scheme.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">His sons.</span>--The pronoun refers to the subject of <a href="/daniel/11-9.htm" title="So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.">Daniel 11:9</a>, which is the northern king (though, according to the LXX. and English Version, it must be his rival). There is a marginal alternative in the Hebrew "son." The LXX. supports the text. If the king of the north last mentioned is Seleucus Callinicus, his sons must be Seleucus Ceraunus, a man of no importance, and Antiochus the Great. It is here stated of the sons that they are stirred up; that they collect a vast army, which advances steadily, overflowing like a torrent, while its masses pass through the land; that they shall return and carry on the war up to the frontier of the southern king. Considering the uncertainty of the readings in the Hebrew text, and the ambiguity of the language, this is anything but a definite statement. However, it has been explained to refer to the wars of Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator, in course of which they took Seleucia, Tyre, and Ptolemais, besieged the Egyptians in Sidon, and actually took possession of Gaza.<p><span class= "bld">One shall certainly come.--</span>Not the king, but the multitude just spoken of. The words "overflow," "pass through" "return," all refer to the ebbing and flowing of the tide of war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress</span>. The version of the Septuagint differs from this, "And his son shall both be stirred up, and shall assemble (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) a great multitude, and, ravaging with it (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), he shall enter, and pass by and return." The K'thib here supports this to the extent at least that it has "his son," not "his sons;" but the verbs are plural. The last clause of this verse in the Massoretic text is transferred by the Septuagint to the next; Theodotion, while, as usual, more closely in agreement with the Massoretic text, is not quite identical with it, "And his <span class="accented">sons</span> shall assemble a multitude moderately numerous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and he that cometh and overfloweth shall come and shall pass by, and shall enter, and shall struggle hard (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), even to his fortress (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Peshitta and the Vulgate are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">But his sons shall be stirred up.</span> The natural inference is that it is the sons of the king of the south who thus are stirred up, but, historically, it can only refer to the sons of Seleucus Callinicus, who, one after the other, succeeded him on the throne: Seleucus Ceraunus, who died after a short reign of rather more than two years; and Antiochus III., Magnus. Certainly Seleucus did little in this conflict, although he undertook a campaign to Asia Minor, in the course of which he was assassinated. It may be that this campaign was intended as a preparation for a great campaign against Egypt. On the death of Ceraunus, he was succeeded by Aatiochtus Magnus. This prince was very warlike. He began to assail Syria, which was in the possession of Philopotor, but was interrupted by news of war in the far East. After a successful campaign in Media and Persia, he wrested first Seleucia from the hands of Ptolemy Philopator; and then proceeded on his invasion of Coele-Syria and Palestine. <span class="accented">And one shall certainly come</span>, <span class="accented">and overflow</span>, <span class="accented">and pass through.</span> This describes in a compendious way the campaigns of Antiochus Magnus. <span class="accented">And be stirred up</span>, <span class="accented">even to his fortress.</span> This is supposed to refer to the recovery of Seleucia. Some think that this rather states that he pierced nearly to Pelusium, the frontier fortress of Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But his sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
