The use of various musical instruments signifies the grandeur and importance of the event. In ancient Babylon, music played a crucial role in religious and royal ceremonies, often used to signal the beginning of worship or to honor deities and kings. The diversity of instruments reflects the cultural richness of the Babylonian empire, which was known for its advancements in arts and music. The immediate reaction to the music underscores the authority of King Nebuchadnezzar and the pressure on the people to conform to his decree.<p><b>the people of every nation and language</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the vastness and diversity of Nebuchadnezzar's empire, which included people from various conquered nations. The Babylonian Empire was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and ethnicities, resulting from its expansive conquests. This diversity is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for the challenge faced by Daniel and his friends, who were among the exiles from Judah. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament's message of the gospel being for all nations and languages, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the vision in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation worships God.<p><b>would fall down and worship the golden statue</b><br>The act of falling down and worshiping the statue represents submission and allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar's authority and the Babylonian gods. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, bowing or prostrating oneself was a common gesture of reverence and worship. The golden statue, likely representing a deity or the king himself, symbolizes the idolatry prevalent in Babylon. This act of worship contrasts with the monotheistic faith of the Israelites, who were commanded to worship only Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The refusal of Daniel's friends to bow down later in the chapter highlights their faithfulness to God and serves as a type of Christ, who resisted temptation and remained obedient to the Father.<p><b>that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up</b><br>This phrase underscores Nebuchadnezzar's role in establishing the statue and the decree to worship it. As a powerful ruler, Nebuchadnezzar sought to unify his empire under a common religion and demonstrate his supremacy. The king's actions reflect the historical context of rulers using religion to consolidate power and control over their subjects. Nebuchadnezzar's pride and self-exaltation are themes that recur throughout the Book of Daniel, ultimately leading to his humbling in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>. The setting up of the statue can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the end-times prophecy in Revelation, where the Antichrist sets up an image to be worshiped (<a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14-15</a>), drawing a parallel between Nebuchadnezzar's actions and future events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who erected the golden statue and commanded all to worship it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_statue.htm">The Golden Statue</a></b><br>A massive idol set up by Nebuchadnezzar, symbolizing his power and the unity of his empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples_of_every_nation_and_language.htm">Peoples of Every Nation and Language</a></b><br>Represents the diverse subjects of Nebuchadnezzar's empire, highlighting the vastness of his rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sound_of_music.htm">The Sound of Music</a></b><br>The signal for all to bow and worship the statue, indicating the use of music as a tool for control and conformity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a city known for its grandeur and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical statues but anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

Music, spectacle, and political power combined to make every knee bow to a man-made image. The verse warns that culture&#8217;s pressures can swiftly move hearts toward false worship, yet it also sets the stage for faithful resistance by those who honor the one true God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</span> The Septuagint renders, "And at that time, when all the nations (Gentiles) heard the sound of the trumpet, the pipe and harp, sackbut and psaltery, and every sound of music, then all the nations (Gentiles), tribes, and tongues, fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up." The last words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently belong to the beginning of the next verse. It is possible <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is due to another reading, but may also have been the result of a desire for variation. Theodotion does not differ from the Massoretic text The two Greek versions agree with the Massoretic in omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The rendering of the Peshitta is, "In the hour when the nations heard the voice of the horn, and flute, and lyre, (<span class="accented">qithra</span>), and harp (<span class="accented">kinnor</span>), and pipe (<span class="accented">tziphonia</span>), and all kinds of music, all these peoples, nations, and tongues, fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up" It is to be noted that <span class="accented">kinnor</span>, its Shemitic equivalent, here again follows <span class="accented">qithra</span>, and that <span class="accented">pesanterin is</span> again omitted. Jerome, in opposition to the Massoretic and the Greek versions, inserts <span class="accented">symphonia.</span> In regard to the Massoretic text here, as in the fifth verse, we have <span class="accented">qathros</span> instead of the <span class="accented">qithros</span> of the K'thib; in this, the K'thib agrees, as generally, with the Eastern instead of the Western form the word assumes. Professor Bevan compares the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> here with that in the Palmyrene inscriptions (Vogue 15). <span class="accented">Zemara is</span> said by Keil to refer only to song; but Furst, Gesenius, and Wirier apply the word to instrumental music. It may, as a matter of fact, be either; if it be a chorus of voices, it is then equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This verse simply chronicles the obedience that was at once and unquestioningly rendered to the command of Nebuchadnezzar. The obedience of these Gentiles served to bring out into clearer relief the steadfastness of these Jews, or, what appears to the king and his courtiers, their obstinacy. Not impossibly, their resistance to the king was emphasized by their remaining standing amid the crowd of those prostrate officials. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3606.htm">Strong's 3606: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
