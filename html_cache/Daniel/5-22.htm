In ancient Near Eastern texts, "son" can also mean "successor" or "descendant." This reflects the biblical practice of using familial terms to denote lineage or succession. Belshazzar was a co-regent with his father Nabonidus, ruling Babylon during his father's absence. This context is crucial for understanding the political and familial dynamics at play.<p><b>have not humbled your heart</b><br>The concept of humility is central to the biblical narrative, especially in relation to God&#8217;s sovereignty. Belshazzar's failure to humble himself is contrasted with Nebuchadnezzar's eventual humility after his period of madness (Daniel 4). Humility before God is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). Belshazzar's pride is a direct affront to God, echoing the pride of other biblical figures who faced divine judgment.<p><b>even though you knew all this</b><br>Belshazzar was aware of the events that transpired with Nebuchadnezzar, including his humbling experience and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This phrase underscores the theme of accountability and the importance of learning from the past. The biblical narrative often emphasizes the responsibility of leaders to heed divine warnings, as seen in the stories of Pharaoh (Exodus 7-11) and the kings of Israel and Judah. Belshazzar's knowledge of these events makes his actions more culpable, highlighting the biblical principle that greater knowledge brings greater responsibility (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The last king of Babylon, known for his pride and defiance against God.

Just as Timothy inherited faith from his mother and grandmother (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), Belshazzar inherited firsthand reports of God&#8217;s sovereignty over kings.<p>&#8211; Scripture consistently teaches that lineage never guarantees righteousness; each generation must choose (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Belshazzar</b><p>&#8211; Daniel names the king personally, making the rebuke immediate and intimate&#8212;no hiding behind the throne.

Because he knew the truth and still exalted himself, judgment was certain. The verse stands as a timeless warning: spiritual heritage and information are blessings, but without humble response they become grounds for divine reckoning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Though thou knewest.--</span>The whole history of Nebuchadnezzar was known to Belshazzar.
