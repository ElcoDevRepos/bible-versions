Historically, Egypt was known for its vast wealth, particularly in gold and silver, which were symbols of economic strength. The control over these treasures suggests a dominant political and military influence. In biblical context, wealth often signifies power and influence, as seen in the reigns of kings like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>). This control could also symbolize the broader theme of earthly kingdoms and their transient nature compared to God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>and over all the riches of Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a prominent nation in biblical history, was often seen as a symbol of worldly power and idolatry. The phrase suggests a complete domination over Egypt's resources, reflecting the historical invasions and conquests by foreign powers. Egypt's wealth was not only in precious metals but also in agriculture and trade. This control could be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies regarding the rise and fall of nations, as Egypt was frequently mentioned in prophetic literature (Isaiah 19, <a href="/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29-30</a>).<p><b>and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him</b><br>Libya and Cush (modern-day Sudan and parts of Ethiopia) were regions south and west of Egypt, known for their own distinct cultures and resources. Their submission indicates a broader geopolitical influence extending beyond Egypt. Historically, these regions had interactions with Israel and Egypt, often as allies or adversaries (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4-5</a>). The submission of these nations could symbolize the reach of the prophesied ruler's power, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations (<a href="/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>). This also reflects the eschatological vision where all nations ultimately submit to God's authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This figure is a central character in <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, often interpreted as a powerful ruler or empire that rises in opposition to God's people.

Historically this fits Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who swept south toward Egypt after earlier victories (<a href="/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetically the verse foreshadows the final world ruler who will repeat Antiochus&#8217;s pattern on a larger scale (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word shows that such authority is never self-generated; it is allowed by the Lord for His purposes (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the treasures of gold and silver</b><p>&#8226; The phrase stresses the conqueror&#8217;s reach into Egypt&#8217;s famed wealth.

Daniel foresees every category of that prosperity falling under the invader&#8217;s control.<p>&#8226; Verse 42 already predicted the land&#8217;s subjection: &#8220;He will extend his power over the lands, and not even the land of Egypt will escape&#8221;. Verse 43 specifies the spoils that prove it.<p>&#8226; The prophecy mirrors earlier warnings that Egypt&#8217;s idols and resources would fail her (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him</b><p>&#8226; Libya lies west of Egypt, Cush (modern Sudan/Ethiopia) to the south.

The word translated "treasures" is a late one, but evidently the Septuagint translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">maqom</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. (<span class="accented">michemanay</span>). Theodotion renders, "And he shall have power over the secret hoards of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and of Libyans, and of AEthiopians in their fortresses." Theodotion has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">metzorayo</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">mitz'adoyo</span>). The Peshitta rendering is, "And he shall have power over the house of the treasures of gold and silver, and of the pleasant things of Egypt, and the Libyans, and the Cushites (Ethiopians) are his allies." The Vulgate follows a slightly different rendering, "And he shall rule the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; through Libya and AEthiopia, too, shall he pass." Having a different reading in the last clause from the Massoretic, the natural Hebrew equivalent for <span class="accented">transibit</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ya'bor</span>) - <span class="accented">a</span> word that could scarcelv arise by mistake from that in the text. <span class="accented">He</span> <span class="accented">shall have power over the treasures of gold and silcer</span>, <span class="accented">and over all the precious things of Egypt.</span> Strictly speaking, this never was the case, as Antiochus never wholly conquered Egypt, although in that expedition, in which he had laid siege to Alexandria, he came very near completing his conquest. <span class="accented">And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall beat his steps.</span> This certainly is not true in the sense in which Jerome takes it, "he shall pass through Libya and Ethiopia." Though Antiochus more than once invaded Egypt, he never passed further into Africa. These nationalities are associated with each other; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8, 9</a>, we have, "The Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield." So in <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> we have the countries spoken of together. It may merely mean that individuals belonging to these nationalities had joined his armies. This is altogether a more ornate and poetical passage than the rest of this chapter, and gives the feeling of a different hand; therefore, probably, it belongs to a time nearer that of Daniel, and contains more of the original prophecy. Professor Fuller remarks on a reference being made to the help Ptolemy received from Cyprus. Cyprus, or Chittim, is referred to in the earlier part of this chapter, but not here. The Lubim and Cushim are contemporary with Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will gain control</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#353;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
