It suggests a moment of meditation and consideration, which is a common practice in biblical narratives when receiving divine revelations. This introspective moment sets the stage for the next part of the vision, emphasizing the importance of understanding and interpreting what is being revealed.<p><b>suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes</b><br>The goat represents the kingdom of Greece, as later explained in <a href="/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>. The prominent horn symbolizes Alexander the Great, who was the first king of the Greek Empire. The imagery of a single, notable horn highlights Alexander's significant power and influence. Historically, Alexander is known for his rapid and expansive conquests, which aligns with the symbolism of the horn.<p><b>came out of the west</b><br>This geographical reference points to Greece, which is located to the west of the Persian Empire. The direction is significant as it indicates the origin of the new power that would challenge and eventually overthrow the Medo-Persian Empire. The westward movement of the goat aligns with the historical expansion of Alexander's empire.<p><b>crossing the surface of the entire earth</b><br>This phrase underscores the vast reach and speed of Alexander's conquests. Historically, Alexander's military campaigns extended from Greece through Asia Minor, Egypt, and into the heart of the Persian Empire, covering a significant portion of the known world at the time. The imagery of crossing the entire earth suggests a swift and unstoppable advance.<p><b>without touching the ground</b><br>This expression conveys the speed and agility of the goat, symbolizing the rapidity of Alexander's conquests. It suggests a supernatural swiftness, as if the goat is flying, which is consistent with historical accounts of Alexander's quick and decisive victories.

His reflective moment highlights that the next scene is God-initiated, not Daniel-driven. Compare the similar transition in <a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>, where the prophet is &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; yet waiting for more revelation. <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10-12</a> shows John in a comparable posture&#8212;meditative, then suddenly overtaken by fresh vision. Scripture portrays thoughtful waiting as the setting in which God often unveils the next layer of His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>suddenly a goat</b><p>The abrupt arrival emphasizes divine timing and the element of surprise. In verse 21 the angel flatly identifies this goat: &#8220;The shaggy goat is the king of Greece.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The goat is a single, unified force in contrast to the two-horned ram (Medo-Persia).<p>&#8226; Its suddenness mirrors how Alexander the Great burst onto the geopolitical scene (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>, &#8220;a mighty king shall arise&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The goat motif recalls the &#8220;he-goat&#8221; used for leadership in <a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>, reinforcing the theme of a dominant ruler raised up for God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a prominent horn between his eyes</b><p>The &#8220;prominent horn&#8221; (lit. &#8220;conspicuous&#8221;) pictures a single, unmatched leader&#8212;again clarified in 8:21 as the first king of Greece.<p>&#8226; Horns symbolize power in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The location &#8220;between his eyes&#8221; suggests focused, visionary strength, all streaming from one source.<p>&#8226; Alexander unified the Greek city-states under one head, paralleling the one horn that embodies consolidated authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came out of the west</b><p>From Jerusalem&#8217;s vantage point, Greece lies to the west. God locates history around His covenant people, showing that world events revolve around His redemptive timeline (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6, 15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-13.htm">Revelation 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Alexander launched his campaign from Macedonia, fulfilling the &#8220;west&#8221; marker exactly.<p>&#8226; This aligns with <a href="/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2-3</a>, where the Persian kings are followed by a western conqueror who rules with &#8220;great dominion.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>crossing the surface of the entire earth</b><p>The phrase paints broad, seemingly unstoppable advance:<p>&#8226; In about a decade Alexander&#8217;s empire stretched from Greece to India, covering &#8220;the whole earth&#8221; known to Daniel (8:7-8; 11:4).<p>&#8226; The wording echoes <a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a> (&#8220;all the earth came to Egypt&#8221;) and <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a> (&#8220;a decree went out&#8230; that all the world should be registered&#8221;), highlighting how biblical writers use &#8220;whole earth&#8221; for large, dominant realms.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over global affairs is clear&#8212;He foretells even the geographic sweep of pagan empires (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without touching the ground</b><p>This vivid image underlines speed and ease of conquest. <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> depicts a leopard with four wings&#8212;another symbol for Greece&#8217;s rapid advance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> calls Babylon&#8217;s horses &#8220;swifter than leopards,&#8221; so the picture language for swift conquest is consistent.<p>&#8226; Historically, Alexander&#8217;s armies covered vast distances at unprecedented pace, toppling Persia in a series of swift, decisive battles (Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela).<p>&#8226; The symbolism assures God&#8217;s people that even meteoric world powers are anticipated and limited by heaven (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a> foretells the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great&#8212;an event history verifies with stunning precision.

Every detail&#8212;location, leader, speed&#8212;displays the Lord&#8217;s mastery over time and nations, reassuring believers that history, however turbulent, unfolds exactly as Scripture declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">An he goat.--</span>This, according to <a href="/daniel/8-21.htm" title="And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.">Daniel 8:21</a>, means the Greek empire, the large horn being the first king, or Alexander the Great. It may be remarked that the goat and the ram form the same contrast as the panther and the bear. Matchless activity is contrasted with physical strength and brutal fierceness.<p><span class= "bld">Touched not the ground.--</span>An exact prediction of the early conquests of Alexander, all whose movements were characterised by marvellous rapidity.

This is explained (<a href="/daniel/8-21.htm" title="And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.">Daniel 8:21</a>) to be Alexander himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched net the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes</span>. The Septuagint, when completed from Paulus Tellensis, agrees in the main with the Massoretic, omitting only "whole" before "earth." The Christian MS. omits the clause, "and touched the ground," but it is in Paulus Tellensis. <span class="accented">As I was considering.</span> "Was" is here used much as an auxiliary verb - an Aramaic usage. "Considering" really suggests "meditating on." <span class="accented">He-goat.</span> The word here used does not elsewhere occur in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is really an Aramaic word, though vocalized here after the analogy of Hebrew. <span class="accented">On the face of the whole earth.</span> The writer had probably in his mind the negative idea expressed in the next verse; hence the word <span class="accented">kol. A notable horn</span>; "a horn of sight;" a horn that no one could fail to remark upon. No symbol could express in a more graphic way the rapidity of the conquests of Alexander the Great than this of the goat that flew over the ground. One can parallel with this the four wings of the leopard in ch. 7. It is singular that Alexander should generally on his coins be figured as horned. Had this vision been due to a knowledge of this - which could not have escaped a Jew of the days of the Maccabees - the writer would certainly have made Alexander not a goat, but a ram. as it is a ram's horn that is intended to be figured on the portraits of Alexander. As everybody knows, this refers to the fable that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon, the ram-horned. It is difficult to assign a reason why the goat was chosen as the symbol of the Grecian power, save that, as compared with the Persian power, the Greek was the more agile. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
