His dreams are significant as they often reveal divine messages. In the ancient Near East, dreams were considered a primary means through which deities communicated with humans. Nebuchadnezzar's dreams, particularly in Daniel, serve as a narrative device to demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms. The king's acknowledgment of the dream indicates its importance and the anxiety it caused him, reflecting the belief that dreams could foretell future events or divine will.<p><b>Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation,</b><br>Belteshazzar is the Babylonian name given to Daniel, a Hebrew captive in Babylon. The use of his Babylonian name signifies the cultural assimilation expected of exiles. Daniel's role as an interpreter of dreams highlights his God-given wisdom and insight, setting him apart from the Babylonian wise men. Interpretation of dreams was a respected skill in ancient Mesopotamia, often associated with divine favor or insight. Daniel's ability to interpret dreams underscores the theme of God's power working through His chosen people, even in foreign lands.<p><b>because none of the wise men of my kingdom can interpret it for me.</b><br>The failure of the Babylonian wise men to interpret the dream emphasizes the limitations of human wisdom and the futility of relying on pagan practices. This scenario is reminiscent of Joseph's experience in Egypt, where Pharaoh's magicians could not interpret his dreams, but Joseph, empowered by God, could. The wise men of Babylon, skilled in various forms of divination and astrology, are depicted as powerless in the face of divine revelation, highlighting the supremacy of God's wisdom over human understanding.<p><b>But you are able,</b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream is attributed to his relationship with God. This phrase underscores the biblical theme that true wisdom and understanding come from God alone. Daniel's consistent ability to interpret dreams and visions throughout the book serves as a testament to his faithfulness and God's favor upon him. It also foreshadows the eventual recognition of God's sovereignty by Nebuchadnezzar.<p><b>because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.&#8221;</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's reference to "the spirit of the holy gods" reflects his polytheistic worldview. While he acknowledges a divine presence in Daniel, his understanding is limited by his cultural and religious background. This phrase can be seen as a recognition of the divine influence in Daniel's life, albeit through a pagan lens. In a broader biblical context, this can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of the Holy Spirit's work, prefiguring the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit dwelling within believers. Daniel's life and actions serve as a type of Christ, who perfectly embodies the Spirit of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who has a troubling dream and seeks its interpretation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/belteshazzar.htm">Belteshazzar (Daniel)</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and wise man in Babylon, known for his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_babylon.htm">Wise Men of Babylon</a></b><br>The magicians, enchanters, and astrologers who are unable to interpret the king's dream.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and influence in the ancient world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine message given to Nebuchadnezzar, requiring interpretation to reveal its meaning and implications.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God reveals His will and purposes through dreams and visions, demonstrating His control over human affairs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>The inability of Babylon's wise men to interpret the dream underscores the limitations of human wisdom without divine insight.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_god's_people.htm">The Role of God's People</a></b><br>Like Daniel, believers are called to be vessels of God's wisdom and truth in a world that often lacks understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Presence of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream is attributed to the "spirit of the holy gods," pointing to the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Daniel's faithfulness in a foreign land serves as an example for Christians to remain steadfast in their faith regardless of their circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_4_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 4:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_18_God_s_rule_over_rulers.htm">How does Daniel 4:18 demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and rulers?

By repeating that it was &#8220;the dream that I&#8230;saw,&#8221; he certifies its authenticity and importance.<p>&#8226; God often speaks to rulers through dreams so that His sovereign purposes cannot be ignored (<a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-8</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that even the mightiest monarch must reckon with revelation that comes from outside himself&#8212;truth delivered by the God who &#8220;does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Meaning: the dream is not a random nightmare; it is a divine message that demands interpretation and obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Belteshazzar&#8221; is Daniel&#8217;s Babylonian name (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>), yet the king turns to him with urgency because previous encounters proved Daniel&#8217;s God gives answers (<a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46-47</a>).<p>&#8226; Interpretation is sought, not debate. Nebuchadnezzar knows that understanding must come from one in touch with the true God, echoing Joseph&#8217;s words: &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The request reveals a heart beginning to soften; God is drawing the king to acknowledge divine authority.<p>&#8226; Meaning: Nebuchadnezzar recognizes that revelation without interpretation is incomplete; God&#8217;s spokesman is needed to bridge the gap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because none of the wise men of my kingdom can interpret it for me</b><p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s magicians, enchanters, and astrologers&#8212;experts in pagan wisdom&#8212;have failed (compare <a href="/daniel/2-10.htm">Daniel 2:10-11</a>). Their impotence highlights the futility of worldly wisdom when confronted with God&#8217;s mysteries (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse exposes the limits of human intellect and occult arts; only the Lord &#8220;frustrates the tokens of the liars and makes diviners mad&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Meaning: God deliberately allows human resources to fall short so that His messenger&#8212;and His truth&#8212;stand in sharp relief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But you are able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you</b><p>&#8226; The pagan king uses plural language (&#8220;holy gods&#8221;) yet senses something uniquely divine in Daniel. Earlier he said the same (<a href="/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>) and later others repeat it (<a href="/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links Spirit-empowered wisdom with faithful servants: Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>), Joshua (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18</a>), and ultimately Christ, &#8220;full of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For the reader, the phrase underscores that true insight comes from the Spirit of the living God, who illuminates His Word (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Meaning: Daniel&#8217;s ability is neither innate nor learned; it is a gift of the Holy Spirit, testifying that the Most High rules and reveals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-18.htm">Daniel 4:18</a> shows a pagan emperor admitting that his dream is real, that human wisdom is bankrupt, and that only a Spirit-filled servant of God can unveil the meaning.

It calls believers to trust the Lord who alone reveals mysteries, rely on His Spirit for understanding, and recognize that all earthly power is subject to His sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">This dream.</span>--More correctly translated, <span class= "ital">This in a dream I saw</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it was communicated to me in a vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This dream I King Nebuchadnezzar have seen.

On the other hand, the verse in the Septuagint which occupies this place is totally different from anything in the Massoretic text: "Before me was it cut down in one day, and its destruction was in one hour of the day, and its branches were given to every wind, and it was driven out and dragged forth, and it ate the grass of the earth, and it was delivered to a guard, and in brazen fetters and shackles was it bound with them. I marvelled exceedingly at these things, and the sleep departed from mine eyes." The first thing that strikes one with this is the fact that it is a translation from Aramaic. The clause, "in brazen fetters and shackles was it bound with them," seems nearly demonstrative of this. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> is not a sentence which any one would naturally write in Greek, but the sentence is natural if the translator followed his Aramaic original slavishly. If, then, this is correct, the hypothesis of a <span class="accented">falsarius</span> is reduced to that of an Aramaic <span class="accented">falsarius</span>, who intruded this verse into the Aramaic original which was conveyed down to Egypt. On the other hand, the verse in the Septuagint completes the narrative which the Massoretic text leaves unfinished. This may be used. as an argument against the authenticity of this version, as the need of completion may have suggested the mode in which the need was to be supplied. But it is also to be noted that there is present the same mixture of sign and thing signified, which, natural in a dream, is so unnatural in ordinary narration, that the <span class="accented">falsarius</span> who had observed the incompleteness of the Massoretic text, and had the necessary skill to supply the want, would not have increased the confusion, already manifest enough. When we turn to Theodotion, we see symptoms of trouble, "This is the vision which I Nebuchadnezzar the king had, and thou, Beltasar, tell the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom were able to show me its interpretation; but thou, Daniel, art able, because a holy spirit of God is in thee." The introduction of the Jewish name Daniel in the midst of a speech in which he is always elsewhere addressed by his Bahylonian name, is suspicious. The repetition, in this as in the Masoretic, of the original incongruity that Daniel, the head of the court magicians, is only summoned after the other magicians have proved unable to solve the mystery of this dream, is to be noted. The Peshitta here partly follows the same text as that followed by Theodotion, and partly that of the Massoretes. Like Theodotion, "Daniel" is inserted, but, following the basis of the Massoretic text in opposition to Theodotion, it has "a spirit of the holy gods." There seems no possibility of imagining the LXX. reading to have developed from the Massoretic, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> If there were any proof of Dr. C. H. H. Wright's hypothesis, that our present Daniel was a condensation of a larger work, it might be supposed that the Massoretic represented one condensation, and the LXX. another. The Septuagint at this point inserts, "And having risen early in the morning,. I summoned Daniel, the ruler of the wise men and chief of the interpreters, and related to him the dream, and he showed all the interpretation of it." In <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. we have two accounts of Pharaoh's dream, first in connection with his actual dreaming, and next in his narrating to Joseph his experience. If the original tract - from the union of several of which we imagine our book has been compiled - from which this chapter is condensed contained, like <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, two accounts of Nebuchadnezzar's vision, and the Egyptian recension followed one condensation of this tract, and the Palestinian another, the phenomena are explicable without the idea of a vague gratuitous variation, such as that of which, on the traditional view, the writer of the Septuagint has been guilty. On the ground that the Massoretic text may represent also a true text of Daniel, another fragment of the original document, we may examine it a little more closely. The king declares the dream to Daniel in a way that indicates a certain attestation of the accuracy of the report of what he had seen. "This is the dream which I Nebuchadnezzar the king saw." Then follows the command to declare the interpretation, "You are master of magicians. I have duly brought before you an accredited dream which I have had, fulfil now your office, interpret to me my dream." This much is natural. What follows is an obvious interpolation. It contradicts what has preceded, which, by implication, asserts Daniel's duty to interpret, and therefore the probability that not last, but first, would Daniel have been appealed to. It contradicts also what follows, which is a commendation of Daniel's powers, which, as known to the king, ought to have led him at once to summon him, as the Septuagint says Nebuchadnezzar did. The commendation of Daniel appears an addition to get over the difficulty, but, like many other attempts of the same kind, it fails, and really adds to the confusion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the dream</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;el&#183;m&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2493.htm">Strong's 2493: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_576.htm">Strong's 576: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1461;&#1428;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2370.htm">Strong's 2370: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze upon, mentally to dream, be usual</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Now, Belteshazzar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1496;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">Belteshazzar -- Babylonian name of Daniel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_560.htm">Strong's 560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, tell, command</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me the interpretation,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;
