This vision parallels the dream in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>, where different metals represented successive empires. The beasts are described in detail earlier in the chapter, each with distinct characteristics, symbolizing the nature and power of the empires they represent. The use of beasts suggests ferocity and dominance, common traits of ancient empires.<p><b>are four kings</b><br>In biblical prophecy, "kings" often represent kingdoms or empires rather than individual rulers. The four kings here are generally understood to symbolize four major empires that have significant roles in biblical history. These are traditionally identified as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. Each of these empires had a profound impact on the history of Israel and the broader ancient Near East.<p><b>who will arise</b><br>The phrase indicates a future perspective from Daniel's time, suggesting that these empires would come into power sequentially. This aligns with the historical rise of these empires, each succeeding the other in dominance over the region. The prophetic nature of this statement underscores the sovereignty of God in the unfolding of history.<p><b>from the earth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the earthly origin of these kingdoms, contrasting with the divine kingdom that is described later in the chapter. The earth is often used in scripture to denote the temporal and transient nature of human power, in contrast to the eternal and unshakable kingdom of God. This sets the stage for the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_great_beasts.htm">Four Great Beasts</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of four kingdoms or empires that will arise on the earth.

In Scripture, beasts are often pictures of empires that act with brute force rather than God-ordained righteousness (compare <a href="/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel sees four distinct creatures, each with its own characteristics, mirroring the four parts of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s statue in <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>.<p>&#8226; The adjective &#8220;great&#8221; underscores their power and global reach (cf. <a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God Himself gives the interpretation (<a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16-17</a>), we take the image at face value: these beasts truly symbolize identifiable world powers raised up in history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are four kings</b><p>The angel clarifies that the beasts &#8220;are four kings&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>). In prophetic literature, &#8220;king&#8221; often stands for both the ruler and his realm (see <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-22</a>; 7:23).<p>&#8226; Just as Nebuchadnezzar was &#8220;king of kings&#8221; representing Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>), each beast embodies a monarch who personifies an empire.<p>&#8226; Scripture shows a pattern: earthly kings rise, yet their authority is limited by the sovereign hand of God (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Viewing the beasts as literal kings keeps harmony with the plain sense of the text and with parallel passages like <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>, which speaks of ten kings symbolized by horns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who will arise</b><p>The phrase highlights timing&#8212;these kings &#8220;will arise,&#8221; indicating they were still future when Daniel wrote (around 550 BC).<p>&#8226; The verb anticipates successive stages of history, paralleling <a href="/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39-40</a> where kingdoms &#8220;will arise after you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God reveals future events to strengthen His people&#8217;s confidence (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>; <a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Each empire appears on schedule, demonstrating that world history unfolds under divine appointment rather than random chance (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the earth</b><p>Their origin &#8220;from the earth&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>) stresses their earthly, human, and therefore limited nature.<p>&#8226; In contrast to the &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; who comes &#8220;with the clouds of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>), these rulers emerge from the turbulent sea of fallen humanity (<a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Earth-born power is temporary and imperfect (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting the earthly source, God prepares us to value the heavenly kingdom that &#8220;will never be destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>) and that is given to the saints (<a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a> teaches that the four frightening beasts in Daniel&#8217;s vision represent four literal kings&#8212;and their empires&#8212;raised up in human history. Though mighty, they are merely earthly and temporary, arising exactly as God foretells. Their rise sets the stage for the ultimate, heavenly reign of the Son of Man, assuring believers that God&#8217;s sovereign plan governs every kingdom of this world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Four kings.--</span>Kingdoms are frequently represented by their heads or founders; hence kings and kingdoms are occasionally used synonymously.
