In the context of <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, King Nebuchadnezzar is the subject of this prophecy. The driving away symbolizes a loss of status and power, reflecting the consequences of pride and arrogance. Biblically, being separated from mankind often signifies a period of humbling and reflection, as seen in the experiences of other biblical figures like Moses and Elijah.<p><b>to live with the beasts of the field</b><br>This phrase suggests a complete loss of human dignity and status, reducing Nebuchadnezzar to the level of animals. In ancient Near Eastern culture, living among beasts was considered a curse and a sign of divine displeasure. Theologically, it underscores the theme of humbling the proud, as God demonstrates His sovereignty over human affairs. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of God using nature to teach and discipline, as seen in Jonah's experience with the great fish.<p><b>and you will feed on grass like an ox</b><br>This phrase highlights the extent of Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation, as he is reduced to eating grass, a diet for animals, not humans. This reflects the biblical principle that God can abase the mighty and exalt the humble. The imagery of eating grass like an ox serves as a metaphor for the king's complete loss of reason and status. It also parallels the judgment on the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, emphasizing the consequences of pride and rebellion against God.<p><b>And seven times will pass you by</b><br>The "seven times" likely refers to a period of seven years, a complete cycle of divine judgment. The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness or perfection, indicating that the period of Nebuchadnezzar's madness is divinely ordained and will last until God's purpose is fulfilled. This period of judgment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses specific time frames to accomplish His will, such as the seven years of famine in Egypt during Joseph's time.<p><b>until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the central theme of the chapter: the sovereignty of God over earthly kingdoms. Nebuchadnezzar's acknowledgment of God's rule is the intended outcome of his humbling experience. This acknowledgment is a key biblical principle, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where God's ultimate authority is affirmed. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual conversion and praise of Nebuchadnezzar, highlighting the transformative power of divine intervention.<p><b>and gives it to whom He wishes.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the biblical teaching that God is the ultimate authority over all earthly powers. It reflects the theme of divine sovereignty found throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a> and <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>. The idea that God appoints rulers according to His will serves as a reminder of His control over history and human affairs. This principle is also evident in the rise and fall of other biblical kingdoms, illustrating that human power is temporary and subject to God's eternal plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who experiences a humbling transformation due to his pride and failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and advisor to King Nebuchadnezzar, who interprets the king's dreams and warns him of the consequences of his pride.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar rules, representing human power and pride.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His ultimate authority and sovereignty over all earthly kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beasts_of_the_field.htm">The Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolic of Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience, living like an animal to learn humility and recognize God's rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride can lead to a fall, as seen in Nebuchadnezzar's life.
