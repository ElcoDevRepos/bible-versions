The "him" refers to the goat, which represents the kingdom of Greece, specifically Alexander the Great. The "ram" symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire. The "rage" indicates the intense and swift military campaign Alexander led against Persia, driven by a desire for conquest and revenge for previous Persian invasions of Greece. Historically, Alexander's campaign against Persia was marked by rapid and decisive victories, reflecting the anger and determination described in the vision.<p><b>and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns</b><br>The "two horns" of the ram represent the dual kingship of the Medes and the Persians, with the Persians being the more dominant power. The act of shattering the horns signifies the complete defeat and dismantling of the Medo-Persian Empire by Alexander the Great. This aligns with historical events, as Alexander's forces decisively defeated the Persians in battles such as the Battle of Issus and the Battle of Gaugamela, leading to the fall of the Persian Empire.<p><b>The ram was powerless to stand against him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the overwhelming power and effectiveness of Alexander's military strategy and forces. The Medo-Persian Empire, despite its size and previous dominance, was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Greek army. This reflects the historical reality of the swift and total conquest of Persia by Alexander, who was known for his tactical genius and the discipline of his troops.<p><b>and the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him</b><br>The imagery of the goat throwing the ram to the ground and trampling it further illustrates the complete and utter defeat of the Medo-Persian Empire. This act of trampling signifies not just military victory but also the humiliation and subjugation of the defeated power. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, where empires rise and fall according to His will.<p><b>and no one could deliver the ram from his power</b><br>This final phrase underscores the totality of the Greek victory over Persia. The phrase "no one could deliver" indicates that there was no ally or force capable of rescuing the Medo-Persian Empire from its fate. This reflects the historical reality that once Alexander began his campaign, there was little that could be done to stop his advance. In a prophetic sense, this demonstrates the inevitability of God's decrees, as foretold through Daniel's visions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram.htm">The Ram</a></b><br>Represents the kings of Media and Persia, as explained later in <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>.

The two Greek versions, though differing very much in the Greek words chosen as equivalent to the Hebrew, yet both represent a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes. The Peshitta omits the introductory "behold," but otherwise can scarcely be said to differ essentially from the received text, though there are some peculiarities due to mistaken reading, but unimportant. The word <span class="accented">yithmormar</span>, "he was embittered," is a word that occurs here and in the eleventh chapter. The root, however, as might be guessed from its meaning, is not uncommon, being found in Genesis Exodus, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Ruth, Job, and Zechariah. How Professor Bevan can class this with "words or roots which occur nowhere else in the Old Testament" it is difficult to see. If this part of the verb occurs in later Jewish literature, it is singular that neither Buxtorf nor Levy chronicles the fact. It does not occur in Western Aramaic, but does in Eastern (comp. Peshitta <a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>; <a href="/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16</a>). It is quite such a word as a man writing among those who spoke Eastern Aramaic might use. Alexander advanced always against Darius; he would not even speak of treating with him. After the passage of the Granicus, he pushed on to Cilicia, overthrew Darius at Issus, B.C.. 333; then, after the conquest of Egypt, advanced against him again at Arbela, and once more inflicted on him an overwhelming defeat. When Darius fled from the field, Alexander pursued him to the shores of the Caspian and into Bactria and Sogdiana, till Darius fell a victim to the treachery of Bessus. Certainly relentlessness was the most marked character of Alexander's pursuit of Darius.
