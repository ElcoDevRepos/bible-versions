This exclusivity highlights the personal nature of God's revelation to His chosen servants. Throughout the Bible, God often reveals His plans to individuals rather than groups, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 3) and Paul on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). Daniel's unique experience underscores his role as a mediator of God's messages to His people.<p><b>the men with me did not see it,</b><br>This phrase indicates a common biblical theme where spiritual realities are perceived by some but hidden from others. Similar instances occur in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the heavenly army, and in <a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, where Paul's companions hear a voice but see no one. This selective revelation emphasizes the spiritual discernment granted to those chosen by God.<p><b>but a great terror fell upon them,</b><br>The presence of divine or angelic beings often induces fear, as seen in other biblical accounts like the shepherds' reaction to the angelic announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>). This terror reflects the overwhelming holiness and power of God's presence, which can be unsettling to those unprepared or unchosen to receive it. It also serves as a reminder of the awe-inspiring nature of God's revelations.<p><b>and they ran and hid themselves.</b><br>The reaction of Daniel's companions mirrors the human instinct to hide from the divine, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a> when Adam and Eve hide from God after sinning. This response highlights the natural human fear of the divine and the unknown. It also contrasts with Daniel's steadfastness and readiness to receive God's message, illustrating the difference between those called to prophetic ministry and those who are not.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision.

It may be added that, as upon that occasion (comp. <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>), the companions of the prophet heard the voice but saw nothing. The words of the voice (<a href="/daniel/10-6.htm" title="His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.">Daniel 10:6</a>) are unrecorded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision.; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</span> The LXX. in the main <span class="accented">agrees</span> with this, but seems to have read <span class="accented">lemahar</span>, "<span class="accented">in haste</span>," instead of <span class="accented">behayhabay.</span> Theodotion renders the last word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span>, implying that he read <span class="accented">behaga</span>. The reading of the Massoretic is superior, as being <span class="accented">less</span> expected. The Peshitta renders in accordance with Theodotion. Jerome agrees very exactly with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">And I Daniel alone saw the vision</span> (comp. <a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>; <a href="/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a>). The Apostle Paul was solitary in hearing intelligible words and seeing Christ; his attendants saw the bright light and heard a voice, but neither saw the speaker nor were able to distinguish the purport of the words. <span class="accented">For the men that were with me saw not the vision.</span> Who those were that were with Daniel we cannot tell; probably they were the ordinary attendants of an officer of rank in the court of the great king. Rashi's idea that they were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, has no probability in favour of it. As little has Professor Fuller's hint that they were Hananiah, Michael, and Azariah. <span class="accented">But a great quaking fell upon them</span>, <span class="accented">so that they fled to hide themselves</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). A yet finer parallel is <a href="/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12-16</a>. Eliphaz there describes a spirit passing before him, although invisible; yet in the horror of contact with the spiritual, all his bones shook and the hair of his flesh stood up. There is a difference to be noted here between the conduct of the attendants of Daniel and those of the Apostle Paul. As we read here, the attendants of Daniel flee to hide themselves, those of the apostle are first struck to the earth and then stand stupefied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Only</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;ad&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
