The "He" refers to God, who is actively involved in the events of human history. The sending of the hand is a supernatural act, demonstrating God's power and authority over earthly kingdoms. This event occurs during the reign of Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon, highlighting the theme of God's sovereignty over nations. The hand is a visible manifestation of God's judgment, similar to other instances in Scripture where God uses physical signs to communicate His will, such as the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> or the pillar of cloud and fire in <a href="/exodus/13.htm">Exodus 13</a>.<p><b>that wrote the inscription</b><br>The inscription is a message from God, written on the wall of the royal palace during Belshazzar's feast. This act of writing is significant, as it conveys a divine message that is both immediate and authoritative. The writing on the wall is a well-known idiom today, symbolizing an ominous warning or inevitable fate. In the biblical context, it serves as a direct communication from God, bypassing human intermediaries. The content of the inscription, revealed later in the chapter, is a prophecy of judgment against Babylon, foretelling its imminent fall to the Medes and Persians. This event fulfills earlier prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>, which predicted Babylon's downfall. The use of writing as a medium underscores the permanence and unchangeability of God's decrees, similar to the written law given to Moses on Mount Sinai.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the time of this event.

As we have seen, the real equivalent of this verse in the Septuagint is a clause in ver. 17, "And the hand which had written (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) stood." If we take this to mean that the band now "<span class="accented">ceased</span> to write," then the original text might be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the verb being written <span class="accented">fleaum</span>, in Mandaean manner. Then it would easily happen that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;</span> (in the older script and ) was resolved into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> (in the older script and ). In support of this, it may be observed that while in the fifth verse the older construction of construct state and <span class="accented">status emphalicus</span> is used to exhibit the genitival connection, in the present case the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> is used as a sign of the genitive. Starting with this, it is easy to see how the Massoretic text arose; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to see the sense of the reading of the Septuagint, unless this fiery hand is to be imagined as tracing and retracing the characters on the wall of the palace, and that the hand only ceased when Daniel stood before the inscription to read. Thec-dotion differs very little from the Massoretic text, and the Peshitta coincides with it. The word for "writing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">resheem</span>), is really "engraving," and therefore peculiarly descriptive of the Assyrian mode of impressing on clay tablets or incising in stone the thing to be preserved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;li&#183;ya&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7972.htm">Strong's 7972: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3028.htm">Strong's 3028: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that wrote</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7560.htm">Strong's 7560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inscribe, sign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inscription.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3792.htm">Strong's 3792: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something written, a writing, record, book</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/5-24.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 5:24 Then was the part of the hand (Dan.
