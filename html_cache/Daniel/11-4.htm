His rapid establishment as a dominant force in the ancient world is well-documented, with his conquests spreading Greek culture and influence across a vast territory. The phrase highlights the transient nature of earthly power, a theme echoed in other biblical passages such as <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which speaks of life as a vapor.<p><b>his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven</b><br>After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire did not remain intact. Instead, it was divided among his four generals, known as the Diadochi: Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy. This division is symbolically represented by the "four winds of heaven," indicating the scattering of his empire in all directions. This historical event fulfills the prophecy and demonstrates the sovereignty of God over the rise and fall of kingdoms, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>.<p><b>It will not go to his descendants</b><br>Alexander's untimely death left no clear heir to his throne. His half-brother, Philip III, and his son, Alexander IV, were both murdered, leading to the end of his direct lineage. This phrase underscores the futility of human plans and ambitions, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, which states that the Lord's purpose prevails over human intentions.<p><b>nor will it have the authority with which he ruled</b><br>The authority and influence that Alexander wielded were unmatched, but after his death, the divided territories lacked the centralized power and cohesion of his reign. This reflects the biblical principle that true authority comes from God, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, and that human authority is temporary and often fragmented.<p><b>because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others</b><br>The imagery of a kingdom being "uprooted" suggests a complete and forceful removal, akin to a plant being pulled from the ground. This signifies the end of Alexander's empire as a unified entity and its transfer to others, fulfilling the prophecy of Daniel. It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly kingdoms and the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This refers to a powerful ruler whose kingdom will be divided after his rise.

It is "plucked up for others besides these"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the exclusion of his lawful heirs--and strangers shall possess the fragments of his empire. This is explained of the partition of Alexander's empire among his generals, and of the murder of his two sons, Hercules and Alexander, but the language is too indefinite to make any such identification certain. The revelation directs our attention to a self-willed king, whose large empire is to come to a sudden and unexpected end; the ruins of it are not to benefit his posterity, but apparently two strangers, who are designated king of the north and king of the south respectively.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those</span>. The LXX. rendering is, "And when he is risen up, his kingdom shall be broken, and divided to the four winds of heaven; not according to his might, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: because his kingdom shall be taken away, and he shall teach these things to others." It is difficult to see what reading the LXX. translator had when he rendered, "his might," for no word meaning "might" is at all like <span class="accented">ahareetho</span>, "his posterity." In the last clause he must have read, not <span class="accented">milbad</span>, but <span class="accented">melamayd.</span> Theodotion resembles the Massoretic more closely; he renders, "But when his kingdom stood (shall stand), it shall be broken, and shall be scattered to the four winds of heaven; and to his latter end (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), nor according to his rule which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be rooted out, and (let) for others besides these." The Peshitta agrees generally with this, only that when in the English we have, "not to his posterity," it has, "not to his sword (<span class="accented">siphoh</span>)" The last clause is somewhat paraphrastic, "And his kingdom shall be rooted, and shall not be to others save these." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The description here given of the empire of Alexander the Great is strictly accurate; his empire did not go to his posterity, nor did any of his successors possess a dominion as extensive as his. <span class="accented">For others beside those.</span> This has been thought to refer to the successors of those who first divided the empire among them. It seems more natural to regard "those" as referring to the posterity of Alexander, as the nearest antecedent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But as soon as he is established,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k &#124;
