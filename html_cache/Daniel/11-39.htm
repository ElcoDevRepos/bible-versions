In the context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, this likely refers to the actions of a king or ruler who seeks to expand his dominion through force. Historically, this could be linked to the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who aggressively expanded his territory. Theologically, it may also foreshadow the Antichrist's future actions, as described in eschatological prophecies, where he will wage war against strongholds, both physical and spiritual.<p><b>with the help of a foreign god</b><br>The "foreign god" implies reliance on a deity not traditionally worshiped by the Israelites. This could refer to the Hellenistic gods introduced by Antiochus IV, who promoted the worship of Zeus. In a broader prophetic sense, it may symbolize the Antichrist's reliance on demonic powers or ideologies contrary to the God of Israel. This aligns with the biblical theme of false gods leading people astray, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-17</a>.<p><b>and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him</b><br>This indicates a system of rewards for loyalty, where the ruler bestows honor and possibly wealth or power on those who support his regime. Historically, Antiochus IV rewarded those who adopted Hellenistic customs and supported his rule. In a prophetic context, this could parallel the Antichrist's manipulation of people through incentives, as seen in <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16-17</a>, where allegiance is rewarded with economic benefits.<p><b>making them rulers over many</b><br>This suggests the delegation of authority to loyal followers, establishing a hierarchy that supports the ruler's agenda. Historically, this was a common practice among ancient empires to maintain control over vast territories. In a prophetic sense, it may reflect the Antichrist's strategy to consolidate power by appointing leaders who will enforce his policies, reminiscent of the ten kings in <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-13</a>.<p><b>and distributing the land for a price</b><br>This phrase implies the selling or granting of land as a means of securing loyalty or raising funds. Historically, rulers like Antiochus IV might have used land grants to reward supporters or finance military campaigns. In a prophetic interpretation, it could symbolize the Antichrist's exploitation of resources and people for personal gain, echoing the corrupt practices condemned by prophets like Micah (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This refers to a powerful ruler who acts with the support of a foreign deity, symbolizing a leader who relies on external, possibly idolatrous, influences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/strongest_fortresses.htm">Strongest Fortresses</a></b><br>These represent the most secure and fortified places, symbolizing strongholds of power and influence that the king seeks to conquer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_god.htm">Foreign God</a></b><br>This indicates an allegiance to a deity outside of the traditional worship of Yahweh, suggesting idolatry or reliance on false gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_acknowledge_him.htm">Those Who Acknowledge Him</a></b><br>These are individuals who support or align themselves with the king, receiving rewards and positions of power in return.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/distribution_of_land.htm">Distribution of Land</a></b><br>This refers to the allocation of territories or resources, often as a reward for loyalty, indicating a transactional approach to governance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_alone.htm">Reliance on God Alone</a></b><br>Believers are reminded to place their trust in God rather than in worldly powers or false deities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Christians should exercise discernment in whom they follow, ensuring that leaders align with biblical principles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_idolatry.htm">The Dangers of Idolatry</a></b><br>The passage warns against the allure of idolatry and the consequences of turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_over_compromise.htm">Integrity Over Compromise</a></b><br>The temptation to gain power or wealth through compromise is real, but integrity should guide our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Earthly rewards and power are temporary; believers should focus on eternal values and God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_11_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 11:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_39_Misuse_of_power_today.htm">How does Daniel 11:39 illustrate the misuse of power and influence today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_attacking_strongholds_show.htm">What does "attack the strongest fortresses" reveal about the king's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Prevent_idolatry_like_in_Daniel_11_39.htm">How can we guard against idolatry as seen in Daniel 11:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Dan_11_39_Eph_6_12_on_spiritual_war.htm">Connect Daniel 11:39 to Ephesians 6:12 on spiritual warfare.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Daniel_11_39_in_leadership.htm">How can believers apply the lessons of Daniel 11:39 in modern leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_39_Power_in_prophecy.htm">What does Daniel 11:39 reveal about the nature of power and authority in biblical prophecy?

No such conduct of Antiochus is recorded. Bribery, however, was not an unusual mode of persuasion adopted by him. (See <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-18.htm" title="Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.">1 Maccabees 2:18</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-30.htm" title="He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him.">1 Maccabees 3:30</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</span> The version of the LXX. is somewhat difficult to render intelligibly, "By desires of cities he shall act, and to a strong fortress shall he come with a strange god whom he will acknowledge; he will increase his glory, and shall master him much, and shall divide his territory freely." The first words of this belong to the previous verse, and at the same time there has been some confusion with the opening words of the present verse according to the Massoretic division. Theodotion is not much closer to the received text, "And he shall act in strongholds of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase glory, and subject many to them, and shall divide the land in gifts." The sense of this last, as given in the Greek versions, is illustrated by <a href="/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>. The Peshitta renders, "He shall pass over to the strong cities, on account of ('<span class="accented">al</span>) the strange gods which he shall see, and he shall rule over many, and the land he shall divide for gain" The Vulgate renders more in accordance with Theodotion than with the Massoretic yet independently, "And he shall do (<span class="accented">faciet</span>) that he may fortify <span class="accented">Maozim</span> with a foreign god, whom he knew not, and shall multiply glory, and shall give to them power in many (things), and shall divide the land gratuitously" This verse as it stands is nearly unintelligible. The suggestion of Hitzig and yon Lengerke, followed by Bevan, that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> ('am), "people," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">eem</span>), "with," is very plausible. The only objection is that none of the versions have it. As, however, it seems to us the only way out of the difficulty, we shall take this reading, and render, with Professor Bevan, "He shall procure for the strong fortresses the people of a strange god." For this use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> Professor Bevan refers to <a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>, "Absalom procured for himself chariot and horses;" <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, so of Adonijah. <span class="accented">Whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory.</span> This we should render, "who have acknowledged him," making the antecedent to the relative, not the king, but "the people of the strange god;" the reference being to the mercenaries of the Syrian army, who were the people of a god strange to the Israelites, and not impossibly made less difficulty in giving up their national gods, and recognizing the gods of Greece as their gods. The K'thib here is the preterite instead of the imperfect, which occurs in the following clause, the reading which we accept here. <span class="accented">He shall increase with glory</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">he shall multiply in glory.</span> These mercenaries of his he would increase, and give ever more honour to them. <span class="accented">And he shall cause them to rule over many</span>. These mercenaries placed in fenced cities were formed into Hellenic communities, and received many of the natives as subjects. The reference is not merely to garrisons being placed in fortresses, but to a chain of Hellenic cities, which, in imitation of the Romans, Antiochus placed in Palestine. <span class="accented">And shall divide the land for gain.</span> As will be seen, the Greek versions and the Vulgate reverse the idea here, and render - the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">gratuitously</span>;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in gifts;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gratuito</span>, which is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>). The word may mean, as it is taken by the English versions and the Peshitta to mean, "for a price;" as in <a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>, David purchased the threshing-floor of Araunah <span class="accented">bimeheer</span>, "<span class="accented">at</span> a price;" but it also means "<span class="accented">wages</span>," as in <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Her priests teach for hire wages (<span class="accented">bimeheer</span>)." The reference, then, is to the fact that in the deplenished state of his treasury, Antiochus divided the land of Palestine to his mercenaries, in lieu of the wages he could not pay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will attack</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
