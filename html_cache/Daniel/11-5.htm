The Ptolemies were one of the four major divisions of Alexander's empire, and they established a powerful and influential rule in Egypt. The term "grow strong" indicates the initial consolidation and expansion of power under the early Ptolemaic rulers, such as Ptolemy I Soter, who secured Egypt and expanded its influence.<p><b>but one of his commanders will grow even stronger</b><br>This part of the verse is understood to refer to Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander's generals, who initially served under Ptolemy I. Seleucus eventually established the Seleucid Empire, which became more extensive and powerful than the Ptolemaic Kingdom. The phrase highlights the shift in power dynamics, where a subordinate commander surpasses his former superior in strength and influence. This historical development is significant in the context of the ongoing conflicts between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, known as the Syrian Wars.<p><b>and will rule his own kingdom with great authority</b><br>Seleucus I Nicator's establishment of the Seleucid Empire marked the beginning of a new and formidable kingdom that stretched from the Mediterranean to the borders of India. His rule with "great authority" signifies the effective governance and military prowess that allowed him to maintain control over such a vast territory. This phrase underscores the theme of shifting power and the rise of new empires, which is a recurring motif in the prophetic literature of the Bible. The authority of Seleucus and his successors played a crucial role in the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East, impacting the history of Israel and the surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_south.htm">The King of the South</a></b><br>This refers to the ruler of Egypt, historically associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Originally a satrap of Babylon, Seleucus fled to Egypt when Antigonus threatened him, effectively becoming &#8220;one of his commanders.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The text thus hints at an unexpected twist: a subordinate will outshine his superior&#8212;God&#8217;s reminder that human hierarchy is never final (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This sets the stage for the long-running North-South rivalry traced through the rest of <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will grow even stronger</b><p>&#8226; With Ptolemy&#8217;s support, Seleucus reclaimed Babylon in 312 BC, launching what historians call the Seleucid Era.<p>&#8226; His territory soon stretched from Syria to the borders of India, dwarfing the land controlled by Egypt. <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a> foreshadows this surge: &#8220;Out of one of them came a small horn, which grew very great toward the south, the east, and the Beautiful Land&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The Scripture underscores that God can elevate whomever He chooses, even from lowly beginnings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will rule his own kingdom with great authority</b><p>&#8226; Unlike a vassal, Seleucus reigned independently, founding a dynasty that lasted two centuries.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;great authority&#8221; anticipates the administrative skill and military clout that allowed him to found cities such as Antioch and Seleucia.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a> later observes, &#8220;The king of the North will raise a greater army,&#8221; confirming the enduring strength of Seleucid power.<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s Word keeps the spotlight on the Lord who &#8220;declares the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a> precisely foretells the early power struggle between the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt and the Seleucid kings of Syria.

The prophecy, fulfilled in verifiable history, reassures believers that every shift in human power remains under God&#8217;s unerring control and serves His unfolding redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The king.--</span>This king of the south (see <a href="/daniel/11-8.htm" title="And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.">Daniel 11:8</a>) is suddenly introduced to our notice. The vagueness of the language prevents us from asserting that the reference is to Ptolemy Soter, who assumed the title of king about B.C. 304. Equally obscure is the phrase "one of his princes." Both the Greek versions interpret the passage to mean "that one of the princes of the king of the south shall be stronger than his former master." It is hard to see how Seleucus Nicator can be called a "prince" of Ptolemy Soter. Any attempt at making the pronoun "his" refer to the mighty king mentioned in the last verse is opposed to the context, and to introduce any fresh sentence such as "shall arise" is an unwarrantable assumption. The obscurity of the Hebrew text is well reproduced in the English Version. It should be stated that Ptolemy took Jerusalem B.C. 320, and that these times must have been very critical to the Jews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes: and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</span> The LXX. rendering differs from this," And he shall strengthen the kingdom of Egypt; and one of the rulers shall overcome him (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and rule; and his power shall be a great power." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in sense. The Peshitta agrees verbally with the Massoretic, but, as it omits the preposition rain, the meaning the translator attached to the verse is difficult to ascertain. The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The verse abruptly introduces the conflict between the Lagid and Seleucid princes. There is no indication in the preceding verses that the four winds of heaven are to be taken so rigidly as is implied by this verse. It is no answer to say that Egypt and Syria alone came into intimate relations with the Jews; it is not a question of fact, but a question of the necessities of composition. The appearance presented is that of a fragment existing separately, and inserted here. The intruded references to the truth which is to be shown have the took of being awkward attempts to prepare for the subjoined narrative. Whatever its origin, it is very difficult to explain to what it refers. The king of the south is certainly one of the Ptolemies, most probably Ptolemy Lagi. <span class="accented">And one of his princes shall be strong above him.</span> This is usually understood to mean Seleucus Nicator, who, when driven from Babylon, his original satrapy, by Anti-genus, took refuge with Ptolemy Lagi, and became a commander under him in his war against Antigonus. Ptolemy also gave him the few troops with which, after the battle of Gaza, he recovered possession of Babylonia. He certainly became by far the most powerful of the successors of Alexander. Indeed, he may be said to have had all the dominions of Alexander save Egypt and Syria on the south, and Macedonia and Greece on the west; for he had overthrown Lysimachus, and absorbed his dominion. <span class="accented">His dominion shall be a great dominion</span> states accurately the extent of the dominions of Scleucus. Rosenmiiller would refer the prenominal suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, "his," to Alexander, and understand Ptolemy as the prince in question; but this is improbable. It is impossible not to observe the abrupt introduction of this prince. Gratz would suggest that a clause has dropped out here, which declared that one of his (Alexander's) princes stood up in the north. Had this any manuscript authority, it would be plausible. More, however, would seem to be wanting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the South</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1490;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ne&#183;&#7713;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
