In the context of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, the stump represents the king's kingdom, which will not be completely destroyed but will be preserved for future restoration. Biblically, the imagery of a stump often symbolizes a remnant that will survive judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>, where a holy seed is described as a stump. The roots remaining in the ground suggest that the foundation or potential for regrowth remains intact.<p><b>with a band of iron and bronze around it</b><br>The band of iron and bronze indicates protection and restraint. Iron and bronze were materials known for their strength and durability in ancient times, often used in construction and weaponry. This suggests that while the kingdom is restrained, it is also protected from complete destruction. The metals may symbolize the divine control over the situation, ensuring that the kingdom will not be uprooted entirely. This can be seen as a form of divine discipline, where God limits the extent of judgment to allow for eventual restoration.<p><b>in the tender grass of the field</b><br>The tender grass represents a place of humility and lowliness, contrasting with the grandeur of a royal palace. This imagery suggests a return to a more natural and humble state, away from the trappings of power and pride. In biblical symbolism, grass often represents transience and the fleeting nature of human life (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). The field is a place of simplicity and vulnerability, emphasizing the humbling process that Nebuchadnezzar will undergo.<p><b>Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven</b><br>Being drenched with the dew of heaven signifies exposure to the elements and a loss of royal comfort. Dew is a natural phenomenon that occurs outside, indicating that Nebuchadnezzar will live outdoors, away from the protection of his palace. Dew in the Bible can also symbolize divine blessing and sustenance (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>), but here it represents the king's humbling experience. This phrase highlights the king's transition from a position of power to one of dependency on God's provision.<p><b>and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete loss of human dignity and status, as Nebuchadnezzar is reduced to living like an animal. Grazing with the beasts symbolizes a return to a primal state, emphasizing the king's humbling and the stripping away of his royal identity. This imagery is reminiscent of the judgment on King Saul, who also experienced a fall from grace due to pride and disobedience. The phrase underscores the theme of divine sovereignty, as God demonstrates His power to humble the proud and restore them according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who has a dream interpreted by Daniel.

(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>.) As long as the stump remained, it might be hoped that the green branches might shoot forth again. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/4-36.htm" title="At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.">Daniel 4:36</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A band.</span>--As the vision continues, the typical language is gradually laid aside, and it begins to appear that by the tree a man is intended. We must not understand by "the band" the chains by which the unfortunate king would be confined, but metaphorically trouble and affliction, as <a href="/psalms/107-10.htm" title="Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;">Psalm 107:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-8.htm" title="To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;">Psalm 149:8</a>. It has been assumed that during his malady the king wandered about at large. This is highly improbable. That his courtiers did not avail themselves of his sickness to substitute some other king in his place is sufficient proof of their regard for him. It is natural to suppose that he was confined in some court of his palace. The inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, and accounts of his reign written by historians, being all composed with the view of glorifying the monarch, naturally suppress all mention of his madness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth</span>. Again the Septuagint differs considerably from the received text, "And thus he said, Leave one root of it in the earth, in order that it may with the beasts of the earth browse in the mountains on grass like an ox." As the reading is the briefer, it is on the whole to be preferred, the more so that the belt of iron and brass is got rid cf. The Septuagint assumes that the work of demolishing the tree had gone on to some extent, and then the watcher intervenes to bring forward this limitation to the completeness of the destruction at first enjoined. Theodotion is in agreement with the Massoretic text, as also the Peshitta. Moses Stuart thinks the belt of iron and brass is represented as being put round the stump of the tree in order to prevent it cracking, and so rotting, in this following yon Langerke. Keil, with more justice, thinks that this is a transition from the symbol to the person symbolized; in this view he agrees with Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Zockler, Behrmann, Hitzig, Ewald, Kranichfeld, and others. There is a further division of opinion <span class="cmt_word">as</span> to whether it symbolizes the mental darkness Nebuchadnezzar will be under, or the limitation of his kingdom, or the fact that, as a maniac, he will be bound with fetters. The fact that, while commentators have devoted so much time to this, there is no reference to it in the interpretation, confirms us in our suspicion of the whole clause. The transition to the person, if barely doubtful in regard to the belt of iron and brass, is obvious in the remaining clauses in this verse. Every tree is wet with the dew of heaven - that would indicate neither degradation nor hardship; and the browsing with the boasts is impossible to a tree.
