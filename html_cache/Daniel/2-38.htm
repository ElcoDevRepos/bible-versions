It echoes the language of <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God gives humanity dominion over the earth, suggesting a parallel between Adam's stewardship and Nebuchadnezzar's reign. The inclusion of "sons of men," "beasts of the field," and "birds of the air" indicates the extent of his authority, covering all creation within his empire's reach. This dominion is reminiscent of the authority given to kings in the ancient Near East, who were often seen as representatives of divine power on earth.<p><b>He has given them into your hand</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief that Nebuchadnezzar's power is divinely ordained. The use of "He" refers to God, indicating that the king's authority is not self-derived but granted by a higher power. This aligns with the biblical theme that God raises and deposes kings according to His will, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over human affairs, a central theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>and has made you ruler over them all</b><br>Here, the focus is on Nebuchadnezzar's unparalleled authority. Historically, Nebuchadnezzar was the most powerful ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, known for his military conquests and extensive building projects, including the famous Hanging Gardens. This phrase highlights his supremacy over all other rulers and nations of his time, reflecting the historical reality of Babylon's dominance in the 6th century BC.<p><b>You are that head of gold</b><br>This statement identifies Nebuchadnezzar as the "head of gold" in the statue from his dream, symbolizing the glory and splendor of his reign. Gold, a precious and enduring metal, signifies the wealth and magnificence of Babylon. This imagery is consistent with Babylon's reputation as a city of great opulence and cultural achievement. Theologically, it sets the stage for the unfolding prophecy in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>, where successive kingdoms are represented by different metals, each inferior to the one before, ultimately pointing to the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This typology can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate reign, where earthly kingdoms give way to the divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, who is the primary recipient of Daniel's interpretation of his dream.

This is no regional claim&#8212;it is universal. <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a> echoes the same idea: &#8220;Now I have placed all these lands into the hand of My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.&#8221; <a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a> shows the king addressing &#8220;all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth.&#8221; The point is clear: human kingdoms rise, but it is the LORD who assigns their scope (cf. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or beasts of the field</b><p>The phrase pushes the extent of dominion beyond humanity to the animal realm. <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> records that God originally entrusted dominion over animals to mankind; here, God narrows that stewardship to one man and one empire for His purposes. <a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12, 21</a> uses the same imagery&#8212;animals finding shelter under Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s &#8220;tree&#8221;&#8212;to portray the breadth of his control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or birds of the air dwell</b><p>Including the birds emphasizes height as well as breadth. Like the mustard seed parable (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>), the picture is of wide-reaching influence that even touches the skies. <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a> speaks of birds nesting in the branches of a great cedar symbolizing empire; Daniel borrows that imagery to show Babylon&#8217;s lofty reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He has given&#8221; underscores that the LORD, not Babylon, is the true source of power (<a href="/daniel/5-18.htm">Daniel 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Into your hand&#8221; speaks of decisive transfer of authority (<a href="/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Made you ruler&#8221; highlights that Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s supremacy is the direct result of divine appointment, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>: &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases.&#8221;<p>This dominion, though vast, is temporary and accountable to the God who granted it (<a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are that head of gold</b><p>The statue&#8217;s gold head (<a href="/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32</a>) stands for Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian empire&#8212;renowned for wealth, splendor, and cultural brilliance. Gold sets Babylon apart from the lesser metals that follow, yet it still belongs to a statue destined to be shattered by the stone &#8220;cut without hands&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34-35</a>). The LORD honors Nebuchadnezzar with glory, while simultaneously signaling that even the most magnificent human kingdom will give way to God&#8217;s everlasting kingdom (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a> proclaims that the sovereign God handed universal dominion&#8212;people, animals, and the breadth of creation&#8212;to Nebuchadnezzar, making him the dazzling head of gold in the prophetic statue. The verse affirms both the real, literal scope of Babylon&#8217;s power and the higher truth that every earthly throne stands only by God&#8217;s decree and ultimately yields to His eternal reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and bath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold</span>. The Septuagint, if we take along with this verse the final clause of the preceding verse, has even more of that look of exaggeration which we can scarcely fail to be conscious of in the Massoretic, "In all the earth inhabited by men, and wild beasts, and birds of the heaven, and fish of the sea, be delivered (all things) into thy hand to rule over all" The addition to the realm of Nebuchadnezzar of the dwelling-place of the fish of the sea is readily observed. Theodotion has the same addition, "In every place where the sons of men dwell, he gave into thy hand beasts of the earth, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and appointed thee lord of all." One cannot but observe not only the presence of "the fishes," but also the fact that only the lower animals are given into his power. It may be that here, as in the LXX., the object is to render with slavish exactness the original - unobservant of the fact that the construction was irregular. Behrmann thinks the author had before his mind <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d8;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">hashaltak</span>), "has made thee ruler," and then changed the construction. Something might be said for <span class="accented">Moses</span> Stuart's view that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> should be translated" wherever," it' there were any similar construction to be found. The rendering of the Peshitta agrees with the sense of Moses Stuart, "Every place where the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men dwell, the bird of heaven, or the beast of the field, he hath given into thy band, and caused thee to rule over all of them." The change of order is to be noted. The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The word for "dwelling" is an older form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dareen</span>), instead of the more recent form, which is that read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dayreen</span>). This copious insertion of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> is an Eastern peculiarity. This assertion of Daniel must seem exaggerated to us, but we must remember the courtly form of address that was usual in Oriental courts, and that Nebuchadnezzar in all likelihood claimed this breadth of empire; so Daniel, in order to make way for the assertion he had already made of the king's dependence on One higher, gives him everything he claims. The addition of the sea to his dominion, although in it Theodotion supports the LXX., is due to a mistaken idea of the point of Daniel's statements. He adds, <span class="accented">Thou art this head of gold.</span> This is not, as Hitzig <span class="accented">asserts</span>, Nebuchadnezzar personally, but to him as the type of the Babylonianmonarch. This was but natural, as of the duration of this monarchy his independent reign extended to the half. Before his advent as "king's son," the Babylonian Empire had to endure the assault of Egypt, and had to struggle for existence against it. With his ado, at began its glory, with his disappearance began at once its decadence. Only under Nebuchadnezzar was Babylon really imperial. The short reigns of his successors are proofs of an insufficient hand upon the reins. With all the tyrannical moods to which be was subject, and all the wild whirlwinds of passion which were liable to carry him away, Nebuchadnezzar, as presented to us here, was a splendid man - utterly unlike Epiphanes, we may remark in passing, with his low tastes and his cringing submission to Rome. His brilliance was that of Alcibiades; he had nothing of the dignity implied in the head of gold. Nebuchadnezzar had secured the love of this captive, as we see by the sorrow with which Daniel communicated to him his approaching madness. There is thus a reasonableness in making him, in especial, the head of gold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wherever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
