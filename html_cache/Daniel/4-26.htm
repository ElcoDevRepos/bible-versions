The stump symbolizes the preservation of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, indicating that it will not be completely destroyed. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, trees often symbolized life, strength, and prosperity. The preservation of the stump suggests hope and the potential for renewal. This imagery is consistent with biblical themes of judgment followed by restoration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>, where a remnant is preserved.<p><b>your kingdom will be restored to you</b><br>This promise of restoration is contingent upon Nebuchadnezzar's acknowledgment of divine sovereignty. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire, and Nebuchadnezzar was its most renowned king, known for his military conquests and architectural achievements, including the Hanging Gardens. The assurance of restoration highlights God's control over earthly kingdoms and rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules</b><br>The phrase "Heaven rules" emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all creation, a central theme in the Book of Daniel. This acknowledgment is not merely intellectual but involves a transformation of heart and recognition of God's ultimate authority. The term "Heaven" is a metonym for God, reflecting Jewish reverence in avoiding the direct use of God's name. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's eventual acknowledgment of God's sovereignty foreshadows the ultimate submission of all nations to Christ's rule, as prophesied in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experiences a humbling period of madness as a result of his pride and failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and interpreter of dreams who serves in the court of Nebuchadnezzar and delivers God's message to the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar rules, representing the height of human achievement and pride.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree that is cut down, symbolizing his impending downfall due to pride.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stump.htm">The Stump</a></b><br>Represents the preservation of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, indicating hope for restoration upon his acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that true authority and power belong to God alone.

Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s throne is preserved beneath the soil of humiliation, waiting for the moment he bows to the sovereign rule of Heaven. The verse assures us that when pride is broken and God&#8217;s supremacy is acknowledged, restoration swiftly follows&#8212;a timeless reminder that the Lord disciplines to redeem, not to destroy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">They commanded--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the watchers. We observe, however, in <a href="/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a> that the command is only ascribed to one of the watchers.

The Lord liveth in heaven, and his power is in all the earth." The last clause here is plainly a paraphrase of "the heavens do rule." "A season and an hour" is a doublet, and since it is to be observed that the phrase, "after that thou shalt have known," is omitted, we may deduce that <span class="accented">thindda</span>, "thou shalt know," is, by transposition of letters, read <span class="accented">l'iddan.</span> Theodotion, who is usually slavish in his following of the Aramaic construction, renders here, "And because they said, Suffer the stump (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of the roots of the tree." This suggests that in the text before Theodotion <span class="accented">mere</span> is omitted from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">l'mishbaq</span>), and it was read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">leishbaqoo</span>), meaning, according to the Mandaitic form of the verb, "they shall leave" - a form in accordance with the previous construction, then further altered to the second person plural. The end of the verse is also slightly different, "Until thou shalt know the heavenly power," reading here <span class="accented">shooltan dee shemya</span> instead of <span class="accented">shaltan shemya.</span> The Peshitta renders, "till thou shalt know that power is from the heaven (<span class="accented">min shemya</span>)." Mr. Bevan remarks on this usage of "heavens" for "God," which he compares with the Mishna and with the New Testament. He does not observe that the difficulty all the translators have with the phrase is a proof that, when the versions were made, it was even then not a common usage; hence that its introduction here was not due to the influence of the Mishnaic Hebrew stretching back, but was owing rather to the peculiar circumstances of Daniel. Professor Bevan's reference to the New Testament is mistaken. In no case in the New Testament is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> used for "God." Even in the Greek Apocrypha is no usage precisely equivalent. Daniel, by using the phrase he did, put himself on the same level as the heathen king - pride against the gods (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and of this, by implication, is Nebuchadnezzar here accused. Certainly the words of his inscriptions do not indicate anything of this sort. In fact, many of the phrases in the prayer to Marduk in the India House Inscription indicate reverent humility almost Christian. Still, these phrases might be due, to some extent, to political custom. The relation of a polytheist to his gods is a psychological enigma to a civilized monotheist. On the one hand, he recognizes his dependence on the god; on the other, he considers the god honoured by his worship, and therefore owing him certain duties in return. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the command</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;ma&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_560.htm">Strong's 560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, tell, command</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to leave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;baq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
