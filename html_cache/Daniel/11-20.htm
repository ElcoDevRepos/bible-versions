The "one" who arises is Seleucus IV Philopator, who succeeded his father, Antiochus III the Great. This transition of power is a common theme in the Book of Daniel, which often deals with the rise and fall of empires and leaders.<p><b>who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom</b><br>Seleucus IV sent Heliodorus, his finance minister, to collect taxes to replenish the kingdom's treasury, which had been depleted by war and tribute payments to Rome. This action reflects the economic pressures faced by the Seleucid Empire and highlights the burdens placed on the people. The phrase "for the glory of the kingdom" suggests that the tax collection was intended to restore the empire's former prestige and power.<p><b>but within a few days he will be destroyed</b><br>This part of the prophecy indicates the sudden and unexpected end of Seleucus IV's reign. Historically, Seleucus IV was assassinated, possibly by Heliodorus, the very official he had entrusted with tax collection. The brevity of his rule is emphasized by the phrase "within a few days," underscoring the transient nature of earthly power.<p><b>though not in anger or in battle</b><br>Seleucus IV's death was not the result of a military conflict or public uprising, but rather a political conspiracy. This aligns with the historical account of his assassination, which was a calculated move by those within his own court.

The phrase signals a changing of the guard. The previous ruler (Antiochus III, v. 19) falls, and God&#8217;s sovereign timeline moves forward. &#8226; Scripture keeps reminding us that kings &#8220;rise and fall&#8221; at the Lord&#8217;s command (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). &#8226; By tying verse 20 directly to verse 19, the Spirit assures us this prophecy is sequential and literal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one will arise</b><p>A new king ascends&#8212;the historical Seleucus IV Philopator.

Taxation, not conquest, becomes his strategy. &#8226; <a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a> shows Pharaoh Necho using a similar tax to bolster his realm&#8212;another reminder that worldly rulers often equate revenue with &#8220;glory.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a> warns that unjust gain will ultimately &#8220;benefit the needy,&#8221; highlighting how God overturns oppressive policies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but within a few days</b><p>The phrase underscores brevity.

History matches prophecy in Seleucus IV Philopator and his tax collector Heliodorus. The verse showcases God&#8217;s meticulous oversight of kingdoms, the fleeting nature of earthly power, and the certainty that every word of Scripture stands true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">A raiser of taxes.--</span>The marginal version is to be preferred, as it gives the meaning of the word "exactor," or "oppressor," which it has in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;">Exodus 3:7</a>, and in every passage where it occurs, except perhaps <a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm" title="For you have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.">Isaiah 9:4</a>. The new king of the north causes the "oppressor" to pass through "the majesty of the kingdom" (a phrase occurring elsewhere only in <a href="/psalms/145-12.htm" title="To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.">Psalm 145:12</a>; but comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm" title="And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.">1Chronicles 29:25</a>), meaning the "richest parts of his kingdom," and not necessarily Palestine. The effect of this policy was that the king fell a victim to a conspiracy in a few days. According to St. Jerome, the person alluded to was Seleucus Philopator.<p>With this verse the first part of the prophecy concludes. It is to be observed that thus far (1) notes of time are very scanty; we only meet with indefinite expressions, such as "in the end of years" (<a href="/daniel/11-6.htm" title="And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.">Daniel 11:6</a>), "certain years" (<a href="/daniel/11-13.htm" title="For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.">Daniel 11:13</a>), "within few days" (<a href="/daniel/11-20.htm" title="Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.">Daniel 11:20</a>), and vague terms expressing sequence of time. (2) There is nothing in the text which implies any change of sovereigns, except in <a href="/daniel/11-7.htm" title="But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:">Daniel 11:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-19.htm" title="Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.">Daniel 11:19</a>. It follows from a careful study of these verses that according to their natural and literal sense they speak of only two southern kings and only one northern king. The southern king of whom we read most is apparently the offspring of the daughter of the first southern king, mentioned in <a href="/daniel/11-5.htm" title="And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.">Daniel 11:5</a>, and it is he who engages in conflict with the first northern king, and with his sons (<a href="/daniel/11-10.htm" title="But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.">Daniel 11:10</a>). The whole prophecy is eschatological, and refers to two opposing earthly powers which will affect the destiny of God's people in the last times. It relates a series of wars and political intrigues between these two powers, all of which prove futile, and it concludes with the account of the death of the first northern king. <a href="/daniel/11-20.htm" title="Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.">Daniel 11:20</a> is a transition verse, in which another character is introduced, who will mark the approach of the end; while <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm" title="And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.">Daniel 11:21</a> introduces the most prominent object of the prophecy--a person who remains before the reader till the end of the chapter, while the southern king gradually disappears (<a href="/daniel/11-25.htm" title="And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.">Daniel 11:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-27.htm" title="And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.">Daniel 11:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-40.htm" title="And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.">Daniel 11:40</a>), and what is apparently his country is mentioned without its sovereign in <a href="/daniel/11-43.htm" title="But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.">Daniel 11:43</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in</span> <span class="cmt_word">battle.</span> The rendering of the LXX. differs very much from this, "Then shall a plant arise out of his root to the restoration (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of the kingdom, a man striking the glory of a king." It is impossible to find any connection between the opening clause of this and the corresponding clause in the Massoretic. Some of the other clauses contain echoes of the Massoretic, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> The first clause of ver. 21 in the LXX. really belongs to this verse, "In the last days he shall be broken, not in wrath nor in war," reading thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ('a<span class="accented">haroneem</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ('a<span class="accented">hadeem</span>). Theodotion agrees in the first clause with the Septuagint, but is equally unintelligible, "There shall arise out of his root one removing a plant of the kingdom; on his preparation he shall act (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), the glory of the kingdom: yet in those days he shall be broken, and not openly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) nor in war shall he stand." The Peshitta renders, "In his stead shall one stand up who shall cause a ruler to pass through even the glory of your kings; and in a few days he shall be destroyed, not in tumult, nor in battle." The Vulgate renders, "In his stead shall stand a vile person (<span class="accented">vilis-simus</span>), and unworthy of royal dignity; and in a few days he shall be broken, not in fury, nor in battle." Difficult as is the interpretation of the words, just as difficult is it to find out the reference. Seleucus Philopator, who succeeded Antiochus, might be called a "raiser of taxes," as he had to meet as best he could the heavy demands of the Roman treasury. The rendering of the Revised suits also, "causing the exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom." The reference might be to Heliodorus, were there any probability that he ever made an expedition to rob the temple. Certainly the story in 2 Maccabees makes it doubtful. It is not likely that Palestine would be exempt from taxation. To a Jew resident in Palestine - the land the possession of which had been the occasion or' so many wars - it might well seem the glory of the Syrian kingdom. <span class="accented">But within few days he shall be destroyed.</span> It is difficult to understand how the writer could reckon the reign of Seleucus Philopator as only a few days. His reign of twelve years was certainly much shorter than that of his father Antiochus, but longer than that of Epiphanes his brother, or of Seleucus III his uncle. The Greek versions do not give this clause. If we do not resort to the somewhat desperate remedy of altering the reading, we are compelled to measure the days from the taxing of Judaea. A good deal might be said for the reading of the LXX. <span class="accented">He shall be destroyed</span>, <span class="accented">neither in anger</span>, <span class="accented">nor in battle.</span> If we may assume as correct the unsupported account of Appian, that Seleucus IV. was assassinated by Heliodorus, we can see that he was destroyed "not in batlle." It conveys an idea of the facts of the case different from that given in Appian, when we say he was "not destroyed in anger." Moreover, the fact that Josephus refers to the death of Seleucus Philopator in terms that imply that be knew nothing of his violent death, makes his alleged assassination by Helio-dorus at least doubtful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(kan&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
