Historically, this is seen as a reference to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his aggressive expansion and persecution of the Jewish people. His actions were largely unopposed, reflecting the prophecy's assertion of doing as he pleases. This aligns with the broader theme in Daniel of earthly powers rising and falling under divine sovereignty.<p><b>and no one will stand against him</b><br>This indicates the invader's overwhelming power and the inability of other nations or leaders to resist him. In the historical context, Antiochus IV faced little effective opposition during his campaigns, particularly in his initial invasions of Egypt and his oppressive actions in Judea. This phrase underscores the temporary success of earthly powers, which is a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel, emphasizing God's ultimate control over human history.<p><b>He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land</b><br>The "Beautiful Land" is a term often used to refer to Israel, particularly Jerusalem and its surrounding areas. This reflects the invader's occupation and control over the land that holds significant spiritual and historical importance for the Jewish people. Theologically, this occupation is seen as a challenge to God's covenant with Israel, yet it also serves as a backdrop for God's redemptive plans. The term "Beautiful Land" highlights the land's significance in biblical prophecy and its centrality in God's promises.<p><b>with destruction in his hand</b><br>This phrase conveys the destructive impact of the invader's presence in the land. Historically, Antiochus IV's reign was marked by severe persecution of the Jewish people, including the desecration of the Temple in Jerusalem. This destruction is not only physical but also spiritual, as it represents an assault on the religious and cultural identity of the Jewish nation. In a broader prophetic sense, this destruction foreshadows future tribulations and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, as seen in the eschatological themes throughout the Book of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invader.htm">The Invader</a></b><br>This figure is a powerful ruler or military leader who acts with autonomy and authority, facing no opposition.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beautiful_land.htm">The Beautiful Land</a></b><br>Often interpreted as a reference to Israel, the land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/destruction_in_his_hand.htm">Destruction in His Hand</a></b><br>Symbolizes the power and potential for devastation that the invader holds, indicating a period of turmoil and conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the invader's apparent power, believers can trust that God remains in control of history and events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>The passage encourages Christians to remain spiritually vigilant, recognizing that earthly powers can rise and fall, but God's kingdom is eternal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_adversity.htm">Hope in Adversity</a></b><br>Even when facing seemingly unstoppable forces, Christians can find hope in God's promises and His ultimate plan for redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>Understanding the times and recognizing the signs of the age are crucial for believers to navigate challenges with wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_protection.htm">Prayer for Protection</a></b><br>Encourages believers to pray for protection and guidance, especially for those living in areas of conflict and turmoil.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_11_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_16_God_s_rule_over_rulers.htm">How does Daniel 11:16 demonstrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and rulers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_authority_from_invader.htm">What lessons can we learn from the "invader" about God's ultimate authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Daniel_11_16_to_Romans_8_28_promises.htm">How does Daniel 11:16 connect with God's promises in Romans 8:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Using_divine_control_in_daily_life.htm">How can we apply the concept of divine control in our daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_16_Trust_God_amid_chaos.htm">What does Daniel 11:16 teach about trusting God's plan despite worldly chaos?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_16_s_link_to_ancient_Near_East.htm">How does Daniel 11:16 relate to historical events in the ancient Near East?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_role_of_the_invader_in_Dan_11_16.htm">What is the significance of the "invader" mentioned in Daniel 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_11_16_s_role_in_prophecy.htm">How does Daniel 11:16 fit into the broader prophecy of Daniel 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_daniel_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Daniel 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_bible_miracles_are_described.htm">What miracles are described in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/isaiah_4's_restoration_vs._ot_judgment.htm">How do claims in Isaiah 4 regarding future restoration align or conflict with other Old Testament prophecies about judgment and destruction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_deut._11_22-23_support_god_driving_out_nations.htm">In Deuteronomy 11:22-23, what evidence supports or contradicts the claim that God would 'drive out' nations from the land?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_doctrine_of_election.htm">What does the Bible say about the King of the South?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Daniel 11:16 Mean</div><b>The invader will do as he pleases</b><p>&#8220;The invader will do as he pleases&#8221; pictures a powerful king advancing without restraint. Historically, this aligns with Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire sweeping southward after defeating the Ptolemies (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13&#8211;15</a>). Yet the wording also foreshadows the later &#8220;willful king&#8221; of 11:36 and anticipates the final antichrist figure who &#8220;will do as he pleases&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4&#8211;7</a>). Scripture consistently shows that God sometimes allows a ruthless ruler temporary freedom to accomplish His larger purposes (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; God sets boundaries, but for a season the invader appears unchecked (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; His unopposed advance reminds us to trust the Lord&#8217;s timetable when evil seems to prevail (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no one will stand against him</b><p>This clause underscores the helplessness of opposing forces. After Antiochus III&#8217;s decisive victory at Paneas (198 BC), the Ptolemaic resistance crumbled (<a href="/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15-16</a>). On a broader prophetic level, it previews a future despot before Christ returns&#8212;&#8220;who can wage war against the beast?&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly powers falter, but the Lord remains sovereign (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Human inability to stop the invader magnifies our need for divine deliverance (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land</b><p>&#8220;The Beautiful Land&#8221; is a cherished biblical title for Israel (<a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>). Antiochus III&#8217;s occupation of Judea fulfilled this line as he stationed garrisons in Jerusalem. Centuries later, Rome repeated the pattern (<a href="/luke/21-20.htm">Luke 21:20-24</a>). Future prophecy points to another desecration of the holy place (<a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s land can be trampled for a time, yet it remains central to His covenant plan (<a href="/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today watch events in the Middle East through this lens, confident that the Lord will ultimately restore Zion (<a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with destruction in his hand</b><p>The invader enters not as a benevolent ruler but wielding &#8220;destruction.&#8221; Antiochus III imposed heavy tribute and later successors desecrated the temple (<a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>). The phrase also signals the coming &#8220;abomination of desolation&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>), culminating in a final outpouring of wrath before Messiah&#8217;s reign (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Violence accompanies godless ambition (<a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Even devastation falls under God&#8217;s sovereign allowance, paving the way for ultimate judgment and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-16.htm">Daniel 11:16</a> describes a conquering king who advances unchecked, occupies Israel, and brings ruin. Historically fulfilled in Antiochus III, it also previews the pattern of end-time tyranny. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God may permit evil rulers brief dominance.<p>&#8226; Human defenses fail, but His overarching plan never does.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s land remains pivotal in prophecy.<p>&#8226; Destruction is temporary; Christ&#8217;s victory and restoration are certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">But he that cometh.</span>--We now hear of further proceedings of the northern king. He follows up the vision mentioned in the last verse, enters the glorious land (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Palestine), and commits great ravages in it. The king is described in language which reminds us of <a href="/daniel/11-3.htm" title="And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.">Daniel 11:3</a>. He acts just as he pleases after his entrance to the southern kingdom. This has been applied to the conduct of Antiochus the Great, but history does not speak of any acts of destruction committed by him in Palestine. On the contrary, it is recorded of him that he treated the Jews with kindness. (On the "glorious land," see <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm" title="And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.">Daniel 8:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Which by his hand</span> . . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">destruction being in his hand.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed</span>. The rendering of the Septuagint is quite different, "And he who entereth in shall do to him according to his will, and there shall be none to resist before him, and he shall stand in the province in the place of his will, and all things shall be fulfilled in his hands." Some of the variations may be understood by a slightly different vocalization, but others resist this explanation. Theodotion renders in a way that suggests a text between that used by the Septuagint translator and the Massoretic, "And he who entereth in shall do to him according to his will, and there shall not be one that standeth before him, and he shall stand in the land of Sabei, and it shall be perfected (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) by his hand." The Peshitta has, "cometh against him," as in the Massoretic, "the glorious land" is put down directly as "the laud of Israel." The Vulgate renders exactly as our Authorized Version does. <span class="accented">But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will</span>, <span class="accented">and none shall stand before him..</span> This is a fair description of the advance of Antiochus the Great through Coele-Syria and Palestine. Fortress after fortress fell before his arms. <span class="accented">And he shall stand in the glorious land</span>; "the land of delight." Ewald would render, "land of the ornament." It is certainly the land of Judea. <span class="accented">Which by his hand shall be consumed.</span> This certainly contradicts history as we have it elsewhere. The Revised is little better, "And in his hand shall be destruction," which is the rendering of Behrmann, Keil, Hitzig, and Bevan. The rendering of von Lengcrke, Ewald, Stuart, and Fuller seems better to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kalah</span>) <span class="accented">as</span> meaning "completely." The answer to the historical objection that Antiochus did not destroy Palestine, is that this distinction refers to Egypt; but as little did he destroy Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The invader</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
