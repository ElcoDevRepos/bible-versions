The "He" refers to God, who granted Nebuchadnezzar his greatness. This reflects the biblical theme that all authority is ultimately given by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's greatness was not due to his own merit but was a part of God's plan, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>, where Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream and acknowledges that God has given him dominion.<p><b>the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him</b><br>This phrase underscores the vastness of Nebuchadnezzar's empire, which included diverse nations and languages. The Babylonian Empire was known for its extensive reach, encompassing much of the known world at the time. The fear and trembling indicate the absolute power and control he wielded, reminiscent of the fear of God described in other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/psalms/2-11.htm">Psalm 2:11</a>). This also foreshadows the universal reign of Christ, where every knee will bow (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>).<p><b>He killed whom he wished and kept alive whom he wished</b><br>This phrase illustrates the absolute authority Nebuchadnezzar had over life and death, a power that was often abused by ancient monarchs. This mirrors the authority of God, who alone has the ultimate power over life and death (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The king's power is a stark contrast to the righteous judgment of God, who is just and merciful.<p><b>he exalted whom he wished and humbled whom he wished</b><br>This phrase reflects the king's control over the social and political status of individuals within his realm. It parallels the biblical principle that God exalts the humble and humbles the proud (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's actions serve as a reminder of the temporary nature of human power and the ultimate authority of God, who alone determines the rise and fall of leaders (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). This also prefigures the work of Christ, who humbles Himself to exalt humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the events of <a href="/bsb/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.
