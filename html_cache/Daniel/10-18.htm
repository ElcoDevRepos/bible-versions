The description "likeness of a man" suggests an angelic figure, possibly Gabriel, who is often depicted in human form when delivering messages from God (<a href="/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15-16</a>, <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>). The appearance of angels in human form is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as the angels visiting Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>) and Lot (<a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>). This emphasizes the accessibility and relatability of divine messengers to humans.<p><b>touched me</b><br>The act of touching is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing impartation of strength, healing, or blessing. In Daniel's context, the touch signifies divine empowerment and reassurance. Similar instances occur in the New Testament, where Jesus touches individuals to heal or bless them (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>, <a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>). This touch indicates a personal and direct interaction between the divine and human realms.<p><b>and strengthened me</b><br>Daniel, overwhelmed by his visions and the presence of the divine, required strength to continue receiving and understanding the revelation. This strengthening is both physical and spiritual, enabling Daniel to stand and listen (<a href="/daniel/10-19.htm">Daniel 10:19</a>). The theme of divine strength is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives power to the faint. This also prefigures the strengthening believers receive through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>), highlighting God's provision for His servants to fulfill their divine missions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Book of Daniel, known for his unwavering faith and his role as a servant in the courts of Babylonian and Persian kings.
