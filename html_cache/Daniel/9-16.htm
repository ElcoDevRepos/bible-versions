Mount Zion, the "holy mountain," holds a very important place in prophecy. It is the outward visible sign of the stability of God's promises to David, the "sure mercies of David,"' as well as the centre of all that is Holy in the kingdom of God. (See <a href="/context/psalms/68-15.htm" title="The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.">Psalm 68:15-16</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/132-13.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.">Psalm 132:13-14</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; and comp. <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm" title="And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;">Daniel 9:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, lilly holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</span> The Septuagint rendering here is in close agreement with the Massoretic. The only point to be noted in regard to Theodotion is that he gives the late, and in this case inapplicable, meaning to "righteousness" of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "almsgiving." The Peshitta, imagining a certain want of completeness in the last clause, inserted after "Jerusalem" "is scattered into all lands." The appeal is made to God's righteousness, because now the seventy years were nearing their end, and God's righteousness was involved in the time not being exceeded. "'Righteousness' here signifies the fair dealing (<span class="accented">wohlverhalten</span>) of God to his people in reference to the fulfilment of hie promises" (Behrmann). "Righteousness" is really <span class="accented">righteousnesses</span>, in the plural, the reference being to the many proofs God has given in the past of his benevolence (Keil). "Thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain," forms a further argument: "The mountain of thy holiness" (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>). A reproach <span class="accented">to all that are about</span> us. There is a striking resemblance here to Jeremiah: repeatedly in his prophecies are the Jews threatened that they will become a reproach (<span class="accented">herpa</span>). Especially is there a resemblance here to <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>, the letter of Jeremiah, to which reference is made in the beginning of the chapter. This whole prayer is saturated with phrases borrowed from Jeremiah. The apocryphal Book of Baruch, which has expanded on tiffs prayer, has also drawn from Jeremiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">O Lord,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in keeping with all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
