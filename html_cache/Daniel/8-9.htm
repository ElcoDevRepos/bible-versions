Here the focus is Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175&#8211;164 BC). <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23&#8211;24</a> describes him as &#8220;a fierce-featured king&#8221; who will become &#8220;very strong.&#8221; The pattern also foreshadows a final end-time Antichrist (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5&#8211;7</a>), giving the verse both a near fulfillment in Antiochus and a farther preview of the last days.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and grew extensively</b><p>Though beginning small, Antiochus expanded rapidly. Verse 24 says he would &#8220;destroy fearfully.&#8221; His rise illustrates how evil can swell beyond its apparent size, a reminder echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> and <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35&#8211;36</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>toward the south</b><p>Antiochus launched multiple campaigns against Egypt (the Ptolemaic kingdom) in 170, 168, and 167 BC (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25&#8211;27</a>). His southern push fulfilled the prophecy word-for-word. <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9&#8211;10</a> underscores God&#8217;s ability to declare the end from the beginning, spotlighting His sovereign control over geopolitical shifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the east</b><p>The Seleucid ruler also turned eastward to secure his eastern provinces and revenue (recorded in 1 Maccabees 3:31). <a href="/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a> later notes &#8220;news from the east&#8221; that would disturb him.

Antiochus invaded Judea, desecrated the temple, halted daily sacrifices, and erected an altar to Zeus (<a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11&#8211;12</a>; 1 Maccabees 1:54). Jesus later pointed to similar defilement as a future sign (<a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>), linking Antiochus&#8217;s actions to the ultimate &#8220;abomination of desolation.&#8221; The phrase assures believers that even hostile advances fall within God&#8217;s prophetic timetable (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a> foretells the rise of a seemingly insignificant ruler from the Seleucid branch who would:<p>&#8226;start small but gain great power,<p>&#8226;expand south into Egypt,<p>&#8226;push east for further dominance,<p>&#8226;and finally assault Israel, desecrating the sanctuary.<p>Historically fulfilled in Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the verse also patterns the future Antichrist.

The Greek versions here differ considerably from the Massoretic text. The LXX. is as follows: "And out of one there sprang a strong horn, and it prevailed and smote toward the south, toward the south-west (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and toward the east, and toward the north." In this case, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is clearly a doublet - an alternative rendering that has got into the text from the margin. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> results from reading <span class="accented">tzephonah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). Theodotion renders, "From one of them went forth a strong horn, and was magnified exceedingly to the south and to the power" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), "host," for <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> It is to be observed that both translate <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> as "strong" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) instead of "little." The reason of this is that they have taken <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">ex</span>, therefore equivalent to a negative. The Peshitta agrees with the Authorized in reading <span class="accented">mitztzeeroth as</span> "little," but leaves out the difficult final word rendered "the pleasant land" in our Authorized Version. Jerome translates <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> by <span class="accented">modicum</span>, and <span class="accented">tzebee</span> by <span class="accented">fortitudinem</span> - a combination of Theodotion and the Massoretic; he must have had <span class="accented">tzaba</span> in his text instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span>, - this may have been due to the fact that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> occurs in the next verse. The reference is sufficiently obvious to Antiochus. The description is accurate; he sprang from one of the four horns or dynasties that succeeded the great conqueror. He carried his arms to the east, but mainly to the south against Egypt. The great difficulties are in the two Hebrew words <span class="accented">mitztz"</span><span class="accented">eeroth</span> and <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> As to the first word, the fact that the two Greek versions have read it are conclusive against the suggestion of Gratz and Hitzig, supported by Bevan, that we should omit <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. (<span class="accented">min</span>). Jephet-ibn-Ali takes <span class="accented">min</span> as denoting the origin of the horn, "from a little one." The further suggestion of Gratz, that we should adopt the reading of the LXX., is rightly combatted by Professor Bevan. The readings alike of the LXX. and Theodotion could have sprung from the Massoretic reading, whereas neither of these could so readily be the original reading. It was necessary that Israel should be prominent in this part of the prophecy; it all leads up to the persecution the Jews endured at the hands of Epiphanes. It is necessary, then, to hold that this word, whatever reading we adopt, and whatever immediate meaning we assign to it, must refer to Palestine. Ewald renders it "ornament;" Bevan, "glory." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
