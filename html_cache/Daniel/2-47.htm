The historical context is the Babylonian exile, where Daniel and other Israelites were taken captive. Daniel's position in the Babylonian court is significant, as it shows God's providence in placing His people in influential positions even in foreign lands. This interaction underscores the theme of God's sovereignty over earthly rulers.<p><b>Your God is truly the God of gods</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's God over all other deities. In the polytheistic culture of Babylon, where many gods were worshiped, this statement is profound. It reflects a recognition of the God of Israel's power and authority, reminiscent of other biblical instances where pagan rulers acknowledge God's supremacy, such as Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>.<p><b>and Lord of kings</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's authority over all earthly rulers, aligning with the biblical theme that God establishes and deposes kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). It foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>), who holds ultimate authority over all creation.<p><b>the Revealer of Mysteries</b><br>God's ability to reveal mysteries is a central theme in the Book of Daniel. This phrase highlights God's omniscience and His power to disclose hidden truths. It connects to other scriptural instances where God reveals His plans, such as Joseph interpreting dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. It also points to the prophetic nature of Daniel's visions, which reveal future events.<p><b>since you were able to reveal this mystery</b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the king's dream is attributed to God's revelation, not human wisdom. This underscores the biblical principle that true wisdom and understanding come from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ, who reveals the mysteries of God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>) and embodies divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading him to seek Daniel's God-given insight.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and captive in Babylon who, through divine revelation, interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream, demonstrating the power and wisdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and as a place of exile for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, revealing the rise and fall of empires, which Daniel interprets, showcasing God's sovereignty over history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_daniel.htm">The God of Daniel</a></b><br>Recognized by Nebuchadnezzar as the "God of gods and Lord of kings" after Daniel interprets the dream, highlighting God's supreme authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br><a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> highlights God's ultimate authority over earthly rulers and kingdoms.

The versions do not exhibit any important variation from the Massoretic text. We must observe the plural form of the pronoun "your," implying the Hebrew nation as a whole, or at all events the three youths along with Daniel. It must be noted that the titles are not in the emphatic state, but are simply absolute, implying that Nebuchadnezzar simply placed the God of heaven, the God of Daniel, in his pantheon, as one of the superior gods. The historical difficulty that some have seen in Nebuchadnezzar making this confession to God, and yet straightway framing a golden image, is due to a failure to understand the attitude of a polytheist to his gods. To the heathen his god is a person he is afraid of, much more powerful than he is himself, able to do him much ill, or, on the other hand, able to bestow upon him much good, but able to be deceived, cajoled, and flattered. In worshipping his deities the heathen feels that any breach of sacred etiquette in regard to any deity is far more certain of bringing down the vengeance of the aggrieved power than any crime, however heinous. He would be most potent in prayer who could go over all the deities of the pantheon, and give to each his or her appropriate title. Thus the Hindus tell tales of fakirs whose power over the gods was due to this. One of the forms of this religious etiquette was to address each deity as if he were the supreme god who alone deserved worship. Lenormant ('Los Premieres Civilizations,' 2:159) gives an address to the god Hourki, or Sin, in which he is called "prince of the gods of heaven and earth, the good god, the great god, lather of gods and men, the lord who extends his power over heaven and earth" In the same work (p. 178) there is an address to <span class="accented">Marduk</span> (Merodach), the favourite deity of Nebuchadnezzar, in which he is called "god of gods, king of heaven and earth." A little further on in the same work (p. 18t) Nebu is called "the supreme intelligence, scribe of the universe, who bears the supreme sceptre, the interpreter of the celestial spheres." In p. 189 Nergal is addressed as "great prince of the greatest gods, who has brought up the greatest gods." In his ' La Magie,' p. 175, he gives an address to <span class="accented">Silik-mulu-ki</span>, regarded as an Accadian name of Marduk, in which he is called "god of gods." In his ' Hibbert Lecture,' pp. 97-104, Professor Sayce, on the contrast between the religion of Babylon and that of Persia in this respect, says that Nebuchadnezzar calls Merodach "lord of all," yet declares him the "son of the gods." The same titles are given to Merodach and to Samas, and yet Samas is distinct from Merodach - he is his comrade in the struggle with the assailants of Otis, the moon-god. At the same time, we must observe the limitations of Nebuchadnezzar's praise - it is simply as the Revealer of secrets that he praises and honours the God of Daniel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Daniel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1436;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
