In the context of <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>, this is often interpreted as referring to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his persecution of the Jews. The power not being his own could imply divine allowance or satanic influence, as seen in other biblical passages where God permits certain rulers to rise for a time (e.g., <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). This also parallels the Antichrist figure in Revelation, who receives power from the dragon (<a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>).<p><b>He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does.</b><br>This indicates a period of significant turmoil and devastation. Historically, Antiochus IV's reign was marked by aggressive campaigns and the desecration of the Jewish temple, fulfilling this prophecy. The phrase "succeed in whatever he does" underscores the temporary triumph of evil, a theme echoed in the broader narrative of Scripture where God allows certain events to unfold for a greater purpose (e.g., Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). This also foreshadows the end-times tribulation described in the New Testament.<p><b>He will destroy the mighty men along with the holy people.</b><br>The "mighty men" could refer to political and military leaders, while the "holy people" are likely the Jews, God's chosen people. Antiochus IV's actions against the Jews, including the Maccabean Revolt, are historical fulfillments of this prophecy. This destruction of both secular and sacred groups highlights the indiscriminate nature of evil rulers. Theologically, it reflects the ongoing spiritual battle between God's people and forces of darkness, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible, culminating in the ultimate victory of Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_little_horn.htm">The Little Horn</a></b><br>This figure represents a powerful ruler or kingdom that arises, characterized by great power and destructive capabilities.

In <a href="/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a> the phrase &#8220;His power will be great&#8221; reminds us of the limited but frightening reach of past oppressors like Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;But it will not be his own&#8221; points to a darker, unseen source. <a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a> portrays the beast receiving authority from the dragon, echoing how Satan fuels earthly tyrants (cf. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226;

Yet every clause hints at limits set by the sovereign Lord. The oppressor&#8217;s strength is not inherent, his destruction is time-bound, his success is temporary, and his assault on the faithful triggers divine deliverance. The passage calls readers to recognize God&#8217;s ultimate control, remain steadfast under trial, and trust that borrowed evil power will finally bow to everlasting righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Not by his own power.</span>--Not might, but cunning, will cause his success.

Thus his destructive powers become astonishing.<p><span class= "bld">The mighty.</span>--No special individuals are pointed out, but rulers in general.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the holy people.</span> This verse involves many difficulties, grammatical and exegetical. These difficulties may be said to be present in all the versions of this passage. The LXX. renders, "And his power shall be confirmed, and not in his strength, and he shall destroy marvellously, and prosper and do, and shall destroy the rulers and people of the saints." Theodotion is so far slavishly close to the Massoretic text; but he seems to have read <span class="accented">qodesh</span>, an adjective agreeing with "<span class="accented">people</span>," instead of <span class="accented">qedosheem</span>, "<span class="accented">saints</span>;" and he omits the negative clause. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic. It emphasizes the negative clause by adding <span class="accented">denaphsho</span>, and translates "<span class="accented">wonders"</span> instead of "wonderfully." Jerome, more intent on expressing what is his own interpretation of the passage than on representing- the original, translates the first <span class="accented">heel</span> ("power") by <span class="accented">fortitude</span>, and the second by <span class="accented">viribus suis.</span> That the power of Epiphanes was great - greater than that of his brother and immediate predecessor - is undoubted. It is also the ease that he was confirmed in his place by the Romans, though, if we are to receive the account of Appian, the direct means of his elevation to the throne was the intervention of Eumenes of Pergamus on his behalf. Thus the reference of the phrase, "not by his own power," may be to this. Little as he might brook the thought, he was but a subject-ally of the great republic. The other interpretations are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Theodoret. Keil, Fuller, Havernick. Kranichfeld. and Moses Stuart, that the reference here is to Divine power as setting up Epiphanes to be a scourge to his people; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of von Lengerke, Kliefoth, Bevan, Behrmann, etc., not by might, but by his cunning; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that of Hitzig, which combines the two - his cunning is divinely given;  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His power</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
