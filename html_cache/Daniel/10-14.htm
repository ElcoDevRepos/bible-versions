The angel is a messenger sent by God to provide understanding. In the biblical context, angels often serve as intermediaries between God and humans, delivering divine messages (e.g., Gabriel's announcement to Mary in <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). The need for explanation suggests that the vision is complex and requires divine insight, highlighting the limitations of human understanding without God's revelation.<p><b>what will happen to your people</b><br>"Your people" refers to the Israelites, Daniel's ethnic and spiritual community. This phrase underscores the focus on the Jewish nation, which is central to God's redemptive plan throughout the Old Testament. Historically, the Israelites were in exile in Babylon during Daniel's time, and the message pertains to their future. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-9</a>.<p><b>in the latter days</b><br>The "latter days" is a prophetic term often used in the Bible to refer to the end times or a future period of fulfillment of God's plans. This phrase is significant in eschatological studies, as it points to events that will occur at the culmination of history. It is used in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/30-24.htm">Jeremiah 30:24</a>, to describe a time of restoration and judgment. Theologically, it can be linked to the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>for the vision concerns those days.</b><br>The vision given to Daniel is specifically about the events that will unfold in the "latter days." This indicates that the prophecy is not just for Daniel's immediate context but has a future fulfillment. The vision's concern with "those days" suggests a divine timetable and purpose, aligning with other prophetic scriptures like <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a> and <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19-22</a>. It also implies that the vision is part of God's sovereign plan, which will ultimately lead to the redemption and restoration of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angelic_messenger.htm">The Angelic Messenger</a></b><br>Likely Gabriel, who is sent by God to deliver messages and explain visions to Daniel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation concerning the future of Israel and the "latter days."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_latter_days.htm">The Latter Days</a></b><br>A term often used in biblical prophecy referring to the end times or a future period of significant events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God, central to the vision and its implications for the future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of prophecy in understanding God's plan for the future.

The time is here more narrowly defined as "those days," that is, the period when the vision of Daniel 11 shall receive its complete fulfilment.
