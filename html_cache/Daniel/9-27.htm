The "one week" is understood as a prophetic week, representing seven years. This period is part of the seventy weeks prophecy given to Daniel, which outlines God's timeline for Israel and the coming of the Messiah. The idea of a covenant echoes other biblical covenants, such as those with Abraham and David, but this one is seen as a political or peace agreement. The identity of "he" is often debated, with interpretations ranging from a historical figure like Antiochus IV Epiphanes to a future Antichrist figure.<p><b>but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering</b><br>The "middle of the week" indicates a three-and-a-half-year point within the seven-year period. This cessation of sacrifice and offering suggests a significant disruption in Jewish religious practices, likely occurring in the temple. Historically, this has been linked to events such as Antiochus IV's desecration of the Second Temple. Prophetically, it is often associated with the actions of the Antichrist during the end times, as described in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-7</a>, where a future leader opposes and exalts himself over everything that is worshiped.<p><b>And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation</b><br>The "abomination that causes desolation" is a term used to describe a sacrilegious act that defiles the temple, making it desolate. This phrase is rooted in historical events, such as the desecration by Antiochus IV, who set up an altar to Zeus in the Jewish temple. Jesus references this prophecy in <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, indicating its future fulfillment. The "wing of the temple" suggests a specific part of the temple complex, possibly an elevated or prominent area, where this abomination will occur. This event is seen as a pivotal moment in eschatological timelines, marking a period of great tribulation.<p><b>until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him</b><br>This final phrase indicates that the perpetrator of the abomination will face divine judgment. The "decreed destruction" suggests a predetermined outcome, emphasizing God's sovereignty and justice. This aligns with biblical themes of God's ultimate victory over evil, as seen in prophecies throughout the Old and New Testaments, including the eventual defeat of the Antichrist in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>. The phrase assures believers that despite the temporary triumph of evil, God's plan will prevail, and justice will be served.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_he_in_the_verse.htm">The He in the Verse</a></b><br>This refers to a future ruler or leader who will make a covenant.

Theod. makes it to be "one week." LXX. "the covenant;" others take it to be the Antichristian prince spoken of in the last verse, an opinion which derives some support from <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>. According to this interpretation, the covenant refers to the agreement which the prince makes with the large number of persons who become apostates. But (1) the word "covenant" does not apply to any such agreement, but rather to a covenant with God, and (2) in <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a> it is the people of the prince, and not the prince, which is the subject of the sentence. It is therefore more appropriate to take Messiah as the subject. During the last closing week of the long period mentioned, Messiah, though cut off, shall confirm God's covenant (comp. <a href="/daniel/11-22.htm" title="And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.">Daniel 11:22</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-28.htm" title="Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.">Daniel 11:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm" title="For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.">Daniel 11:30</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-32.htm" title="And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.">Daniel 11:32</a>) with many, that is, with those who receive Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</span> The verse in the Septuagint corresponding to this is evidently mixed up with confluent readings and notes as to earlier verses, "And the covenant shall be strong upon many, and again he shall turn ('repent') <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and it shall be built in breadth and length, and according to the end of times until the end of the war, and after seven and seventy times and sixty-two years until the end of the war; and the desolation shall be taken away in confirming (or 'when he shall confirm') the covenant to many weeks; and in the end of the week the sacrifice and the oblation shall be taken away, and upon the temple shall be the abomination of desolation until the end, and an end shall be given to the desolation." In this mass of confusion this much is clear - the clause, "the covenant shall be strong (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) upon many," is a doublet of the clause, "when he shall confirm the covenant to many weeks." The clause, "and after seven and seventy times and sixty-two years," is a doublet of the beginning of the twenty-sixth verse; "Till the end of the war, and the desolation shall be taken away," is an alternative version of the last clause of the twenty-sixth verse. When those extraneous elements are got rid of, we have left a rendering of the twenty-seventh verse, which may afford us light as to the text. "The covenant shall be strong upon many" is a possible rendering of the Hebrew (see <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>). The alternative reading, "when he shall confirm (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the covenant during many weeks," implies the infinitive with the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span>, and "weeks" in the plural, and one omitted - the latter is omitted, indeed, by both. "And in the end of the week" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">qaytz</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">hatzee</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "sacrifice and offering shall be taken away, and upon the temple shall be the abomination of desolation" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>), "holy," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>), "wing," "outspreading," or it may be tendered "wing of temple" - "until the end, and an end be given to desolation" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">toottan</span>), "is given," or "appointed," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tittak</span>), "poured out." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic, "And one week shall confirm (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) a covenant to many, and in the middle (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) of the week my sacrifice and offering shall be taken away" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">zebehee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">zebah</span>), and possibly <span class="accented">min hath</span>, instead of <span class="accented">minhah -</span> "and upon the temple (shall be) the abomination of desolations, and till (at) the end of the time an end is set (given) to the desolation." It will be observed that Theodotion agrees with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">toottan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tittak</span>) The Peshitta is closer still to the Massoretic, but the last verb the translator seems to have read as <span class="accented">tanah</span>, "shall rest." Tertullian, in his quotation from the Vetus, shows that in this verse it follows Theodotion, or rather the version which he made his basis. He, however, connects "half a week" with "one week." The Vulgate rendering is, "One week also shall confirm the covenant to many, and in the middle of the week sacrifice and offering shall cease" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>: (<span class="accented">yishbath</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "and in the temple shall be the abomination of desolation" - therefore reading with the Greek versions and the Vetus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span> - "and even to the consummation and end shall the desolation continue" - reading, therefore, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, and omitting the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('al), "upon" - the latter is not a probable reading. From this examination of the versions one thing is clear - we must accept, with all its difficulties, "confirms." Gratz would change one letter, and translate, "he shall cause many to transgress the covenant." The wilder supposition of Professor Bevan, which would change two letters, and translate, "the covenant shall be annulled for many," is equally out of court. The next point is <span class="accented">kenaph</span>, "expansion." Here the Greek and Latin versions, including that in <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, but excluding the doublet mixed up in the text of the Vatican and Alexandrian Codices, have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Peshitta and the author of the reading intruded into the Alexandrian Codex have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>). However, these two are not agreed as to the interpretation. The Peshitta renders "wings," the Vatican and Alexandrian scribes render <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the word used (<a href="/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>) for a pinnacle of the temple. There is, whichever is preferred, not the slightest justification for the suggestion of Kuenen that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> Professor Bevan thinks "this emendation is well-nigh certain." If that is so, any suggestion of any critic may be equally commended. We have practically four Greek versions here, two Syriae if we include Paulus Tellensis, two Latin, and not one of them gives the slightest hint that this "well-nigh certain" reading was in existence. The balance of evidence is decidedly in favour of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>), especially so in the light of our Lord's words. Had the text with which his hearers were familiar contained the suggestive word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, "wing," it was impossible, speaking as he did of the setting up of the Roman eagles in the temple, to have avoided remarking on the word used. Our Lord in this case must have had the Hebrew before him, as he does not render as the Greek versions do, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>. We must thus hold <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to have been the original text. <span class="accented">And he shall confirm the covenant with many.</span> What is the subject of the verb here? Hengstenberg, Hitzig, and yon Lengerke make the one week the nominative of the verb. Professor Bevan objects that to represent a week making a covenant, or making it burdensome, is without analogy. Both Hitzig and Hengstenberg appeal to Malachi 3:19; <a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where a "day" is represented as acting. Theodotion translates thus. The natural meaning, according to the Hebrew, if we do not pass beyond the clause before us for the subject of the verb, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, (<span class="accented">bereeth</span>), "covenant." Thus we ought naturally to render either - taking the hiphil in its causative sense - "a covenant," or "the covenant shall confirm;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> secure "one week to many," or - and this is better, as supported by <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> (4), in the sense given to the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">gabar</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "the covenant shall prevail for many during one week." This agrees with the first version we find in the Septuagint, The covenant - God's covenant with Israel, and this it must be here - "prevails with many;" his covenant to send a Messiah, a part of the eternal covenant with Israel, would prevail with the hearts of many of Israel during one week. If we reckon our Lord's ministry to have begun in the year A.D. , and the conversion of St. Paul A.D. , we have the interval required. After the conversion of St. Paul, the Gentiles more than the Jews were brought into the Church. Another theory is that it is the coming prince who is referred to. This is assumed by critics to be Antiochus; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald. Moses Stuart, who adopts this view, refers to the covenant made with Antiochus by many of the Jews. But <span class="accented">bereeth</span> thus absolute, is used not of alliances, but of the Divine covenant. The theory that the coming prince is Jason the brother of Onias does not suit with the idea of confirming the Divine covenant, so the interpreters that hold this view - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bevan - do not make "the prince" the subject of the verb. If <span class="accented">bereeth</span> is the Divine covenant, as by usage it is, then the prince whose people were to lay waste the temple and city cannot be he that confirms the covenant. We might take the last clause of ver. 26 as in a parenthesis, and regard the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">confirm"</span> as the Messiah who was cut off. It seems, however, preferable to take the construction as we have done above, and make <span class="accented">bereeth</span> the subject of the verb. <span class="accented">And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.</span> In accordance with our interpretation of the previous clause, we would interpret this, "The covenant shall cause offering and oblation to cease." What covenant is this? The new Messianic covenant promised in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 8:8) quotes this passage as Messianic, and as proving that sacrifice and offering had ceased with <span class="accented">Christ's</span> sacrifice of himself. Interpreters of the critical school are reduced to considerable difficulties in their endeavours to square this passage with their preconceived notions Bevan admits that the natural subject of the verb <span class="accented">yashbeeth</span> is the "prince who shall come;" but having come to the conclusion that this coming prince is Jason, he could not be said to make sacrifice and offering cease. Professor Bevan is constrained to change the reading from hiphil into the kal. He has certainly the justification that the Septuagint and Theodotion both make the word passive. Ewald regards the coming prince as Epiphanes. If so, then he must be the subject all through. In that case we are obliged to contradict usage and maintain that the covenant confirmed refers to an alliance made with apostate Jews; but this, as we have said, contradicts the usage in regard to "covenant" in this absolute position. Further, we have, in the end of ver. 26, the "end of the war" referred to. Yet, according to this interpretation, after the war is over the prince is making sacrifice and offering to cease. Ewald, recognizing the difficulties of his interpretation,declares, "As soon as the discourse touches upon the man and his projects, it is at once agitated with the profoundest disorder." <span class="accented">The midst of the week.</span> On the ordinary Christian interpretation, this applies to the crucifixion of our Lord, which took place, according to the received calculation, during the fourth year after his baptism by John, and the consequent opening of his ministry. Hitzig and many critical commentators see a reference in the half-week to the time, times, and half a time, and they identify that with the time during which Antiochus had set up the heathen altar in the temple. It is to be observed that this view has the support of 1 Macc. 1:54, which applies the next clause to Antiochus. If the traditional view is correct - that the prophecy published in the days of Cyrus applied to the coming Romans - then it was but natural that a writer in the clays of John Hyrcanus should be prone to interpret the prophecy of events in his own time. As we have already seen, the reference cannot be to Antiochus. The extreme popularity of Daniel by the time 1 Maccabees was written, probably about <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, is to be observed. <span class="accented">For the overspreading of abominations</span>, <span class="accented">he shall make it desolate.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version, "And upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate;" in the margin the rendering is, "upon the pinnacle of abominations." We have seen that the great balance of evidence was in favour of inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "holy place," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>, "wing." Even if we take the Massoretic reading, and render it according either to the text or the margin, we have difficulties. We have no instance of a bird supporting itself by one wing. If <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>. (<span class="accented">konaph</span>), "wing," is retained, the reference to the Roman eagles can scarcely be resisted. The word has several derivative meanings: "The edge" of the earth, as <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>; from this is derived the rendering in the Revised. In the present passage, Gesenius, Furst, and Wirier regard it as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but no such meaning is elsewhere found in Hebrew. "<span class="accented">He</span> shall make <span class="accented">it</span> desolate." In Hebrew, this is only one word, <span class="accented">meshomaym</span>, the participle. The word occurs twice in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1, 4</a>, and there means "astonished," "stupefied." It is imitated in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>, but the preceding word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">shiqqootz</span>), is in the singular, and agrees with <span class="accented">meshomaym.</span> Here we have the noun <span class="accented">shiqqootzeem in</span> the plural while the participle is in the singular. In <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a> we have another variation, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>. The versions translate as if the word had been in the singular; hence we may doubt whether the noun was not originally singular, all the more that in the parallel passage (<a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>) we have the singular used. An accidental reduplication of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>, which begins <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, would explain the present reading. Professor Bevan suggests that we read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal participle plural from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, "to sit;" but the evidence of the versions is decisive against this. The rendering of the clause would be thus, "and upon the temple the abomination of desolation." The usage of <span class="accented">shiqqootz</span> leads us to think of heathen idols, as <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, Chemosh, the abomination of Moab; Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon, <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>; Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Zidonians. More important is <a href="/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a>, "They set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it." We have here the combination suggested by Professor Bevan. From the fact that Daniel seems to have been saturated with Jeremiah, his suggestion might have had weight; but the utter want of any hint in the versions that the reading was even doubtful, compels us to be against this view. There is no case where <span class="accented">shiqqootz</span> means "altar," but many where it means" idol." So the setting up of a heathen altar is not what would naturally be thought of in this connection. The traditional opinion, that this refers to the Roman eagle standards, which were in a sense "idols," and were regarded especially as such by the Jews, is certainly at least plausible on grammatical grounds, and may be regarded as certain from other reasons; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> its suitability to the meaning of the other verses. <span class="accented">Even until the</span> <span class="accented"> consummation</span>, <span class="accented">and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate.</span> The Revised Version is very different here, "And even unto the consummation, and that determined, shall <span class="accented">wrath be</span> poured out upon the desolator."
