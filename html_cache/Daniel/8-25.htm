His craftiness is emblematic of the broader theme of deception in biblical prophecy, where false leaders rise through manipulation. This aligns with the biblical warning against false prophets and deceitful workers (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>). The prosperity of deceit suggests a temporary success of evil, a recurring theme in Scripture where wickedness seems to thrive before divine intervention.<p><b>and in his own mind he will make himself great</b><br>This reflects the pride and self-exaltation of the figure, reminiscent of the pride of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a> and the arrogance of the little horn in <a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>. Such self-aggrandizement is a hallmark of tyrannical rulers throughout history, who often see themselves as invincible or god-like. This self-perception is a direct challenge to God's sovereignty, echoing the pride of Lucifer in <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>. The theme of pride leading to downfall is consistent with <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction."<p><b>In a time of peace he will destroy many</b><br>This phrase suggests a betrayal of trust, as destruction comes unexpectedly during a period of perceived safety. Historically, Antiochus IV used deceitful diplomacy to gain control, leading to the persecution of the Jewish people. This tactic of sudden destruction during peace is echoed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where sudden destruction comes upon those who feel secure. It serves as a warning of the false peace offered by worldly powers, contrasting with the true peace found in Christ (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>and he will even stand against the Prince of princes</b><br>The "Prince of princes" is widely interpreted as a reference to Jesus Christ, the ultimate authority and ruler. Antiochus IV's desecration of the Jewish temple and persecution of God's people is seen as standing against God Himself. This opposition to divine authority is a type of the antichrist spirit, which opposes Christ and His kingdom (1 <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>). The conflict between earthly powers and divine authority is a central theme in biblical prophecy, culminating in the ultimate victory of Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><b>Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands</b><br>This indicates a divine intervention in the downfall of the oppressor, suggesting that his end will come through God's power rather than human effort. Historically, Antiochus IV died suddenly of disease, which many see as fulfillment of this prophecy. The phrase "not by human hands" emphasizes God's sovereignty and the futility of human pride against divine will. This mirrors the fate of the statue in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which was destroyed by a stone "not cut by human hands" (<a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>), symbolizing God's ultimate authority over earthly kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_greece.htm">The King of Greece</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>, the vision involves a ram and a goat, symbolizing the Medo-Persian Empire and the Greek Empire, respectively. The "king of Greece" refers to Alexander the Great, whose empire is represented by the goat.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_little_horn.htm">The Little Horn</a></b><br>This figure emerges from one of the four divisions of Alexander's empire. Traditionally, this is interpreted as Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a ruler known for his persecution of the Jewish people and desecration of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_host_of_heaven.htm">The Host of Heaven</a></b><br>This term is often understood to represent the people of God, particularly the Jewish nation, who suffer under the oppression of the little horn.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince_of_princes.htm">The Prince of Princes</a></b><br>This title is generally understood to refer to God Himself, or more specifically, the Messiah, who ultimately triumphs over all earthly powers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_evenings_and_mornings.htm">The Vision of the Evenings and Mornings</a></b><br>This refers to the prophetic vision given to Daniel, which includes the period of oppression and desecration, often interpreted as the 2,300 evenings and mornings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_evil.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Evil</a></b><br><a href="/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a> highlights how the little horn uses deceit to achieve its ends.

"And in his heart he shall be magnified, and by treachery shall he corrupt many. and for the destruction of many. shall he stand, and as eggs shall he crush (them) in his hand," reading <span class="accented">k'baytzeem b'yad yishbar</span> instead of <span class="accented">be'eseph yad yishahabayr.</span> The Peshitta has several points of peculiarity, "And in his might he shall prosper: he shall restrain with his hand, and his heart shall be lifted up, and by treachery shall he corrupt many. and against the Ruler of rulers shall he rise up, and with grasp of the hand shall be taken." Even Jerome,. who is usually in close agreement with the Massoretic text, translates at variance with their pointing. He begins this verse really with the last clause of the previous one, "And he shall slay strong ones and the people of the saints according to his will, and treachery shall be directed in his hand, and in plenty of all things he shall slay many, and against the Prince of princes shall he rise, and without hand shall be broken." The most singular thing is the omission by both the Greek versions of the phrase <span class="accented">sar sareem</span>, which both appear to have read <span class="accented">yishhat rabbeem</span> a variation of reading difficult to understand. On the whole, these varying versions seem to have sprung from a text originally not differing much from the Massoretic, save in the opening clause, in which the Septuagint appears to suit the succession of thought better. The return of Antiochus from his expedition to Egypt was the signal for his persecution of the saints; then his "purpose, was against the holy people." <span class="accented">Craft shall prosper in his hand.</span> The account we have in the First Book of the Maccabees shows the perpetual exercise by Antiochus and those under him of treachery. At first, at all events, his craft prospered (1 Macc. 1:30). <span class="accented">And he shall magnify himself in his heart.</span> Bevan thinks this hardly accurate, as the hiphil is ordinarily causative. Only <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> has this verb used in hiphil as reflexive. The sense, however, seems to be, not that he shall become proud, but that he has many great projects in his mind one (1 Macc. 1:42) being to unify all the various peoples that were under his sceptre, so that they should be one in religion and law. He further had the design of conquering Egypt and uniting it to his empire, and would have done so had the Romans not intervened. <span class="accented">And by peace shall destroy many.</span> The word translated "peace" means also "<span class="accented">suddenly."</span> The Greek versions both render it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>. Schleusner suggests that the word was derived from another root. There dues not seem such a root in Levy. The probability is that the meaning passed from "tranquillity" to the notion of "treachery." The meaning assigned to the word by Jerome is inexplicable, <span class="accented">copia rerum.</span> It happens that both the meaning attached to the word <span class="accented">shalvah</span> by the Greek versions here, and that found in other passages, harmonize. The treachery of the chief collector of tribute lay in feigning peace, and then slaying the people (1 Macc. 1:29). <span class="accented">He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes.</span> The Greek versions, as above observed, have instead of this, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - a phrase that might be a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The Massoretic text here seems the preferable. Antiochus had certainly risen up against God, the "Prince of princes," or, as the Peshitta renders, "Ruler of rulers." <span class="accented">He shall be broken without hand.</span> The fact of Antiochus dying immediately after an ineffectual attempt to rob a temple in Elymais, and dying, not from the effect of wounds received, but from chagrin, is symbolized by this statement. The figure of a horn pushing in this direction and in that is resumed; hence Epiphanes is said to be broken. And that he was not overthrown in battle by any rival for the crown is shown by the statement that it was without hands that he was so broken. The Romans resisted his attempt to take <span class="accented">possession</span> of Egypt, so he was baulked in his pursuit after one object. He desired to unite his whole multifarious empire, so that it should be homogeneous; that was baulked by the victorious revolt of the Jews under Judas Maccabaeus. If he could have made his empire homogeneous, he might have expected to be able to defy the Romans. The defeat of his army by Judas might easily be remedied if he had money to pay his troops, so he attempted the plunder of the temple in Elymais, said to be that of Artemis. The inhabitants resisted so vehemently, that he had to retire baffled. This it was that caused his death. Polybius hints at madness inflicted by a Divine hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
