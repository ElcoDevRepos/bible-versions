His story is found in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>, where he becomes the first murderer by killing his brother Abel. Cain's actions serve as a warning against jealousy, anger, and disobedience to God. The admonition to not be like Cain emphasizes the importance of resisting sinful tendencies and choosing righteousness.<p><b>who belonged to the evil one</b><br>This phrase indicates Cain's spiritual alignment with Satan, the "evil one." In <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, Jesus describes the devil as a murderer from the beginning, linking Cain's actions to satanic influence. This connection underscores the spiritual battle between good and evil, highlighting the need for believers to align themselves with God rather than the forces of darkness.<p><b>and murdered his brother</b><br>The act of murder is a grave sin, violating the sanctity of life created by God. Cain's murder of Abel is not just a physical act but a manifestation of deep-seated sin, including envy and hatred. This event foreshadows the destructive power of sin and the need for redemption through Christ, who offers forgiveness and transformation.<p><b>And why did Cain slay him?</b><br>This rhetorical question invites reflection on the motives behind Cain's actions. It encourages believers to examine their own hearts and motivations, recognizing that sinful actions often stem from deeper issues like pride, jealousy, and a lack of love.<p><b>Because his own deeds were evil</b><br>Cain's deeds were evil because they were not offered in faith or obedience to God. <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a> contrasts Cain's offering with Abel's, noting that Abel's was given in faith, making it acceptable to God. This highlights the importance of the heart's condition in worship and service to God.<p><b>while those of his brother were righteous</b><br>Abel's righteousness is attributed to his faith and obedience to God. His offering was accepted because it was given with a sincere heart, demonstrating the principle that God values the intentions behind actions. Abel's righteousness serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate example of righteousness and obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, known for committing the first murder by killing his brother Abel.

In the LXX and the New Testament it seems to mean "slay" without necessarily implying the cutting the throat of a victim. That Cain's works were evil is not stated in Genesis, but is inferred from God's rejection of him. Compare carefully the remarkably parallel passage, <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>. The wicked envy the good the blessedness of their goodness, and try to destroy what they cannot share. The war between good and evil is one of extermination; but the wicked would destroy the righteous, while the righteous would destroy wickedness by converting the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Do] not [be]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
