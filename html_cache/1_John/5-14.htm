This confidence is rooted in the believer's faith and the work of Jesus Christ, who provides access to the Father (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The phrase "before Him" emphasizes the personal and direct relationship believers have with God, reminiscent of the access granted to the high priest in the Holy of Holies, now available to all through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>If we ask anything according to His will,</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of aligning one's prayers with God's will. The concept of God's will is central to biblical teaching, as seen in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>) and Jesus' submission to the Father's will in Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>). Praying according to God's will involves understanding His character and purposes as revealed in Scripture, ensuring that requests are in harmony with His divine plan.<p><b>He hears us.</b><br>The assurance that God hears prayers is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing comfort and encouragement to believers (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>). This hearing implies not just auditory reception but an attentive and responsive engagement from God. The confidence that God hears is based on His faithfulness and the believer's relationship with Him through Christ, who intercedes on their behalf (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing false teachings and needed reassurance of their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His role as a listener and responder to prayers made according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_prayer.htm">Confidence in Prayer</a></b><br>Believers can approach God with boldness, knowing that He is attentive to their prayers when they align with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_will.htm">Understanding God's Will</a></b><br>To pray effectively, Christians must seek to understand God's will through Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/aligning_desires_with_god's_purposes.htm">Aligning Desires with God's Purposes</a></b><br>Our prayers should reflect a heart that desires God's plans and purposes above our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith.htm">The Role of Faith</a></b><br>Trust in God's wisdom and timing is crucial, even when His answers differ from our expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_in_prayer.htm">Community in Prayer</a></b><br>Encouragement to pray with others, seeking collective discernment of God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_5_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 5:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_5_14_Boost_prayer_confidence.htm">How does 1 John 5:14 encourage confidence in our prayer life?
