In the biblical context, earthly possessions refer to tangible assets such as money, property, and goods. The Bible often addresses the responsibility that comes with wealth, emphasizing stewardship and generosity. In the Old Testament, the Law provided for the care of the poor through practices like gleaning (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). Jesus also taught about the dangers of wealth, warning that it can become an idol (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>) and urging His followers to store up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>sees his brother in need</b><br>The term "brother" here is understood to mean fellow believers, though it can extend to all people in need. The early Christian community was known for its mutual care and support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions to ensure no one was in need. This reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and the teaching of Jesus in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), which expands the definition of "neighbor" to include anyone in need.<p><b>but withholds his compassion from him</b><br>Withholding compassion implies a deliberate choice to ignore or neglect the needs of others. Compassion is a key attribute of God, as seen in His dealings with Israel (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>) and in the ministry of Jesus, who was moved with compassion for the crowds (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). The call to be compassionate is a reflection of God's character and is a recurring theme in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>).<p><b>how can the love of God abide in him?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the authenticity of one's faith if it is not accompanied by acts of love and compassion. The love of God is not merely an emotion but is demonstrated through action (1 <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>). The Apostle John emphasizes that genuine love for God will manifest in love for others (1 <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20-21</a>). This echoes Jesus' teaching that the greatest commandments are to love God and love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The indwelling of God's love is evidenced by a life that reflects His love through selfless acts and concern for others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, likely composed of believers facing challenges in living out their faith in a tangible way amidst societal pressures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother_in_need.htm">Brother in Need</a></b><br>Represents fellow believers or anyone within the community who is experiencing material or emotional lack.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_test_of_genuine_love.htm">The Test of Genuine Love</a></b><br>True Christian love is demonstrated through action, not just words.

This is not hypothetical; it speaks to anyone who has &#8220;earthly possessions&#8221; right now (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never condemns ownership itself, yet it always ties ownership to stewardship. The God who &#8220;gives us richly all things to enjoy&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>) also commands us to &#8220;be ready to share.&#8221; <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a> shows early Christians doing exactly that.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that every resource in our hands ultimately belongs to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Holding those goods loosely is a sign that we know we are merely managers, not masters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sees his brother in need</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;sees&#8221; highlights personal awareness. Need is not abstract&#8212;it becomes our responsibility when we notice it (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Brother&#8221; first points to fellow believers (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>), though love naturally spills over to all people. John assumes a covenant family where members recognize and respond to one another&#8217;s burdens (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Need&#8221; covers food, shelter, medical costs, unpaid bills, even emotional support (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). Seeing a need obligates us to consider how the Lord would have us meet it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but withholds his compassion from him</b><p>&#8226; Compassion is more than sentiment. It is love moving the will to act, as when Jesus &#8220;was moved with compassion&#8221; and fed the crowd (<a href="/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;withhold&#8221; is to shut the door on mercy, the very opposite of God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>). <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a> warns against dismissing needs with mere words.<p>&#8226; Excuses can sound pious&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;m praying for you&#8221; or &#8220;Someone else will help&#8221;&#8212;yet <a href="/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a> states plainly, &#8220;He who gives to the poor will lack nothing, but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how can the love of God abide in him?</b><p>&#8226; John&#8217;s question expects a negative answer. Genuine love for God inevitably produces love for people (<a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20-21</a>). If tangible mercy is absent, the profession of faith rings hollow.<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). That love is not theoretical; it mirrors Christ, who &#8220;though He was rich&#8230;became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The issue is not earning salvation but evidencing it. When the Holy Spirit indwells a heart, generosity follows as proof that &#8220;the love of God has been poured out within our hearts&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a> measures love by action. Possessions are God-given trusts; seeing a brother&#8217;s need is a call to stewardship; withholding compassion exposes a disconnect between profession and practice. Where the love of God truly abides, open eyes, open hearts, and open hands naturally flow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - "But <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> if a man not only fails to do this, but even steadily contemplates <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc7;</span> another's distress, and forthwith (<span class="accented">aorist</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> closes his heart against him, although he has the means of relieving him, how can he have any love for God?"
