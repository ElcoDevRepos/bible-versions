It echoes the teachings of Jesus, who summarized the law and the prophets in the command to love God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The use of "commandment" underscores the authority and divine origin of the instruction, aligning with the biblical theme of obedience to God's will.<p><b>that we should believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ,</b><br>Belief in the name of Jesus Christ is central to Christian doctrine, signifying trust and faith in His identity and work. The "name" represents His character, authority, and mission. This belief is foundational for salvation, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>, which states that salvation is found in no one else. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of faith, as exemplified by Abraham's belief in God (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), which was credited to him as righteousness.<p><b>and we should love one another</b><br>This command to love is a recurring theme in John's writings, reflecting Jesus' new commandment in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>. Love is the distinguishing mark of Jesus' disciples and is rooted in the love God has shown through Christ (1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>). The early Christian community was known for its love and care for one another, which served as a powerful witness to the surrounding culture (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>).<p><b>just as He commanded us.</b><br>This phrase reinforces the authority of Jesus' teachings and the continuity of His message with the Father's will. It recalls Jesus' words in <a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>, where He commands His followers to love one another as He has loved them. The command to love is not optional but integral to the Christian life, reflecting the sacrificial love of Christ and the unity of the body of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, the Son of God, whose life, death, and resurrection are the foundation of Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely facing challenges of false teachings and needing encouragement to remain steadfast in their faith and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_love_as_central_commandments.htm">Faith and Love as Central Commandments</a></b><br>The verse highlights the dual commandment of faith in Jesus and love for others as foundational to Christian life.

Unlike human laws that multiply endlessly, the Lord distills His will into one cohesive command.<p>- Earlier verses (<a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21-22</a>) remind us that God answers prayer when we &#8220;keep His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight,&#8221; showing that obedience flows from relationship, not ritual.<p>- Echoes of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a> point to God&#8217;s timeless pattern: one God, one heart, one command that governs all of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that we should believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ,</b><p>- &#8220;Believe&#8221; is not mere mental assent; it is wholehearted trust, staking life and eternity on Jesus alone (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>).<p>- &#8220;Name&#8221; points to the full authority and character of the Son. To believe in His name is to rely on His finished work, confess His deity, and embrace His lordship (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p>- The singular focus&#8212;&#8220;His Son, Jesus Christ&#8221;&#8212;guards us from drifting into generic spirituality. Salvation is found in no one else (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>- Faith here is present and continuous, just as Jesus said in <a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>: &#8220;This is the work of God: to believe in the One He has sent.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we should love one another</b><p>- Faith in Jesus produces family resemblance. Children of God practice the same self-giving love that the Son displayed (<a href="/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16-18</a>).<p>- Love is concrete: open hands, open hearts, meeting needs (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a>).<p>- This love is the litmus test of genuine conversion&#8212;&#8220;By this everyone will know that you are My disciples&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p>- It is reciprocal: &#8220;one another&#8221; calls every believer to give and receive, creating a community where no one is disposable (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as He commanded us.</b><p>- Jesus framed love as a direct order, not a suggestion (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;just as&#8221; sets Christ&#8217;s love as the measure and model: sacrificial, initiating, steadfast.<p>- Obedience validates faith (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-6</a>). True believers do not cherry-pick commands; they yield to the whole counsel of Christ.<p>- Walking in His commandments brings assurance (<a href="/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>) and the abiding presence of the Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a> gathers the entire Christian life into one diamond: trust in Jesus and love for His people. Believe in the Son&#8212;resting fully in His name&#8212;and let that faith pour out in practical, sacrificial love. This is God&#8217;s settled will, Christ&#8217;s direct charge, and the Spirit&#8217;s ongoing work in everyone born of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his commandment is this</span> (comp. verse 11), <span class="cmt_word">that we should believe the Name, etc.</span> "Do not forget," St. John would say, "what the full scope of his commandment is.

We can believe a document (<a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>; <a href="/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>), or a statement (<a href="/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>; <a href="/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>), or a person (<a href="/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>); but how can we believe a name? By believing those truths which the name implies: in the present case by believing that Jesus is the Saviour, is the Messiah, is the Son of God. To produce this belief and its consequence, eternal life, is the purpose of St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>); it is also the will of God (<a href="/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>), and the command of his Son (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>). This belief will inevitably produce as its fruit that we "love one another [present tense of what is habitual], even as Christ gave us commandment" (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12, 17</a>). Throughout the Epistle, and especially in this passage (verses 22-24), the references to Christ's farewell discourses in the Gospel are frequent. Here the main ideas of those discourses are represented - obedience to the Divine commands, particularly as to faith and love; promised answer to prayer, abiding in God; the gift of the Spirit (see on 1 John 4:5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(haut&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
