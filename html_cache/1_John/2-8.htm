The "new commandment" echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>, where He instructs His disciples to love one another as He has loved them. This commandment is not new in the sense of being recently created, but new in its emphasis and depth, reflecting the transformative love of Christ. The Apostle John, writing to early Christians, reinforces the importance of this commandment in the context of their faith journey. The concept of a "new commandment" also ties back to the Old Testament, where the law was given to guide the Israelites, but now it is fulfilled and expanded in Christ.<p><b>which is true in Him and also in you</b><br>The truth of the commandment is embodied in Jesus Christ ("in Him") and is meant to be reflected in the lives of believers ("in you"). This duality emphasizes the incarnational aspect of Christian ethics&#8212;what is true in Christ should be manifest in His followers. The phrase underscores the transformative power of Christ's love and truth, which believers are called to emulate. This reflects the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers to live out this commandment. The truth being "in Him" points to Christ as the ultimate example and source of truth, while "in you" indicates the personal and communal application of this truth among believers.<p><b>For the darkness is fading</b><br>This phrase speaks to the eschatological hope present in the early Christian community. The "darkness" represents sin, ignorance, and the moral corruption of the world, which is gradually being overcome by the light of Christ. This imagery is consistent with the Johannine theme of light versus darkness, as seen in <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, where the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. The fading darkness suggests the ongoing process of sanctification and the ultimate victory of God's kingdom. Historically, this reflects the early church's experience of moving from the old covenant to the new, as well as the anticipation of Christ's return.<p><b>and the true light is already shining</b><br>The "true light" refers to Jesus Christ, who is described as the light of the world in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>. This light is not only a source of guidance and truth but also a revelation of God's character and will. The phrase "already shining" indicates the present reality of Christ's influence and the transformative power of the Gospel in the world. It suggests that the kingdom of God is both a present and future reality, with believers called to live in the light of Christ now, even as they await the fullness of His kingdom. This aligns with the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, where the glory of the Lord rises upon His people, drawing nations to His light.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "Him" in the verse, the embodiment of the new commandment and the true light.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, facing challenges of false teachings and needing encouragement in their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Symbolic of sin, ignorance, and separation from God, which is diminishing as the true light shines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/true_light.htm">True Light</a></b><br>Represents Jesus and the truth of the Gospel, illuminating the path for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_commandment.htm">The New Commandment</a></b><br>The commandment to love is both old and new.
