It reflects a familial relationship within the early Christian community, emphasizing the spiritual maturity and guidance he provides. The term "little children" is consistent with John's style throughout his epistles, where he often uses familial language to convey intimacy and concern (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1, 1</a> <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>).<p><b>let no one deceive you:</b><br>John warns against false teachings and deception, a recurring theme in his letters. During this time, early Christians faced various heresies, such as Gnosticism, which denied the true humanity and divinity of Christ. This warning echoes Jesus' own cautions about false prophets (<a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-5</a>) and aligns with Paul's exhortations to the churches to remain vigilant against deceptive doctrines (<a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>).<p><b>The one who practices righteousness is righteous,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of righteous living as evidence of one's faith. In the Jewish tradition, righteousness is closely linked to adherence to God's commandments and ethical conduct. The concept is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where figures like Abraham are considered righteous due to their faith and obedience (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). This teaching aligns with James' assertion that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>just as Christ is righteous.</b><br>Christ is presented as the ultimate standard of righteousness. His life and teachings provide the model for Christian conduct. The righteousness of Christ is both imputed to believers through faith (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>) and demonstrated through His sinless life (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).

He that <span class="accented">doeth</span> righteousness is righteous; for a righteous man inevitably practices righteousness." There are always persons who endeavour to reconcile religion with moral laxity, and in St. John's day some Gnostics definitely taught that conduct was immaterial to the spiritual man, for no external acts could defile such. "The external acts," says St. John, "prove the man's spiritual character and origin. He that doeth righteousness is righteous and is of God: he that doeth sin is of the devil." Note the difference between "even as" in verses 3 and 7. There <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces a pattern as a fresh motive for self-purification; here it introduces a comparison.
