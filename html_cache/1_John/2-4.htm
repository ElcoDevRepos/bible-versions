In the biblical context, "knowing" God goes beyond intellectual acknowledgment; it implies an intimate, experiential relationship. This echoes the Hebrew understanding of "yada," which means to know deeply and personally. In the New Testament, knowing God is often associated with recognizing Jesus as the Messiah and living in accordance with His teachings (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). The claim to know God is significant in a culture where religious identity was central to one's life and community.<p><b>but does not keep His commandments,</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the necessity of obedience as evidence of genuine faith. In the Jewish tradition, keeping commandments was a sign of covenant faithfulness. Jesus summarized the commandments as loving God and loving others (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>), and John reiterates this in his epistles. The early church faced challenges from false teachings, such as Gnosticism, which downplayed the importance of moral conduct. This statement counters such beliefs by affirming that true knowledge of God is demonstrated through obedience.<p><b>he is a liar,</b><br>This strong language reflects the seriousness of the claim. In biblical terms, lying is not just about falsehood but also about living in contradiction to God's truth. The use of "liar" connects to the broader biblical theme of truth versus deception, seen in the contrast between God and Satan, the father of lies (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The early church was vigilant against false teachers who claimed spiritual insight but lived contrary to the gospel.<p><b>and the truth is not in him.</b><br>"Truth" in John's writings often refers to the reality of God's revelation in Jesus Christ. To say the truth is not in someone implies a lack of genuine relationship with God. This phrase underscores the inseparability of truth and action in the Christian life. The concept of truth is central to John's gospel and epistles, where Jesus is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The absence of truth indicates a disconnect from the transformative power of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing false teachings and needed guidance on living out their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals in the early church who claimed to know God but did not adhere to His commandments, leading others astray.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>True knowledge of God is demonstrated through obedience to His commandments.

Throughout Scripture, words are weighed against deeds (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>; <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p>- The phrase opens the door to self-examination: anyone can &#8220;say&#8221; something, but the Lord &#8220;tests the hearts&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I know Him&#8221;</b><p>- &#8220;Know&#8221; is not casual acquaintance; it speaks of personal, covenant relationship. Jesus describes eternal life as knowing &#8220;the only true God, and Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>- Claiming to know God carries the expectation of alignment with His character (<a href="/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but does not keep His commandments</b><p>- Obedience is the practical evidence of relationship. Jesus links love and obedience explicitly: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>- &#8220;Commandments&#8221; here encompass all that Christ has taught, summarized in loving God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>) yet including moral specifics (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25-32</a>).<p>- The conjunction &#8220;but&#8221; draws a stark contrast: lip service with no life change.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is a liar</b><p>- Scripture does not soften the verdict. A profession without obedience is falsehood (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>- Calling such a person &#8220;a liar&#8221; aligns with God&#8217;s consistent intolerance for hypocrisy (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>).<p>- This mirrors earlier words in the letter: &#8220;If we claim to have fellowship with Him yet walk in darkness, we lie&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the truth is not in him</b><p>- Truth is more than accurate information; it is an indwelling reality. Jesus is &#8220;the truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and His Spirit leads into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p>- When truth dwells within, it inevitably shapes conduct (3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>). Lack of obedience exposes a vacancy where truth should reside (<a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a> draws a clear line: knowing God and obeying God are inseparable. Words alone cannot substitute for a transformed, obedient life. Genuine believers will increasingly reflect Christ&#8217;s commands, proving that truth not only informs them but indwells them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> now takes the place of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> with the subjunctive, but the two are equivalent (cf. <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>, which is almost exactly parallel to this, and shows what "knowing him" really is, viz. having fellowship with him, just as not keeping his commandments is the same as walking in darkness). St. John says, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the case being hypothetical - if there be such a man, he is a liar, and has no idea of truth (see on 1 John 1:8). He must have lost the very power of recognizing truth to maintain that he knows Christ, when he habitually transgresses his commands. It is no great thing, as Bode says, to know as the devils do, who "believe and tremble." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
