The coming of the Son of God is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold the birth of a Savior. The historical context of this statement is rooted in the first-century Jewish expectation of a Messiah. The use of "we know" emphasizes the certainty and assurance of the believers' faith in the reality of Christ's incarnation.<p><b>and has given us understanding</b><br>This refers to the spiritual enlightenment that believers receive through the Holy Spirit. In <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, Jesus promised that the Spirit of truth would guide believers into all truth. This understanding is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, relational knowledge of God. It contrasts with the Gnostic belief prevalent at the time, which claimed secret knowledge as the path to salvation.<p><b>so that we may know Him who is true</b><br>The phrase points to a personal and experiential knowledge of God, who is the ultimate truth. This echoes Jesus' declaration in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He states, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." The cultural context here challenges the relativistic views of truth in the Greco-Roman world, affirming the absolute truth found in God alone.<p><b>and we are in Him who is true</b><br>This indicates a union with God through Jesus Christ, a theme prevalent in the writings of John. In <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, Jesus speaks of abiding in Him as a branch abides in the vine. This union is both spiritual and covenantal, reflecting the intimate relationship between God and His people, as seen in the covenantal language of the Old Testament.<p><b>in His Son Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase identifies Jesus as the Son of God, affirming His divine nature and unique relationship with the Father. It underscores the Christian belief in the Trinity, where Jesus is distinct yet one with the Father. The historical context includes the early church's struggle against heresies that denied the divinity of Christ, such as Arianism.<p><b>He is the true God and eternal life</b><br>This is a profound declaration of the deity of Christ, equating Him with God. It aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The phrase "eternal life" is a key theme in John's writings, emphasizing not just the duration but the quality of life found in a relationship with Jesus. This eternal life is a present reality for believers, as well as a future hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_god.htm">Son of God</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is central to the Christian faith as the divine Son sent by God to bring salvation and understanding to humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/him_who_is_true.htm">Him who is true</a></b><br>This phrase refers to God the Father, emphasizing His nature as the ultimate truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, who is both fully divine and fully human, and through whom believers have eternal life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>A key concept in Christian theology, representing the life that believers have in Christ, which is both a present reality and a future hope.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/understanding.htm">Understanding</a></b><br>The insight or knowledge given by Jesus, enabling believers to know God truly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_through_christ.htm">Understanding Through Christ</a></b><br>Jesus provides believers with the understanding necessary to know God truly.

Whatever the world and its philosophy chooses to assert, Christians know that the Son of God has come in the flesh, and has endowed them with mental faculties capable of attaining to a knowledge of the true God. The Christian's certainty is not fanaticism or superstition; he is "ready always to give answer to every man that asketh a <span class="accented">reason</span> concerning the hope that is in him" (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>); by the gift of Christ he is able to obtain an intelligent knowledge of him who is indeed God. "Him that is true" does not mean God, who is not, like the devil, a liar, but "very God," as opposed to the idols against which St. John goes on to warn them. The Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus the Epistle ends as it began, with a fulfillment of Christ's prayer. In chapter 1 John 1:3 we had, "That ye also may have fellowship with us," which is identical with "That they may be one, even as we are" (<a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). And here we have, "That we know him that is true," which coincides with "That they should know thee the only true God" (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). This prayer of the great High Priest is fulfilled. "We <span class="accented">are</span> in him that is true," says the apostle, "(by being) in his Son Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">This is the true God, and eternal life.</span> Does "this" refer to God or to Christ? We must be content to leave the question open; both interpretations make excellent sense, and none of the arguments in favour of either are decisive. The question is not important. "That Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God," who was with the Father from all eternity, is the very foundation of St. John's teaching in Gospel and Epistles; and it is not of much moment whether this particular text contains the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ or not. But if, with St. Athanasius, we interpret "this" of Christ, the conclusion of the letter is brought into striking harmony with the opening of it, in which (<a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>) Christ is spoken of as "the <span class="accented">Eternal Life</span> which was with the Father, and was manifested to us." Moreover, we obtain a striking contrast with what follows. "This Man, Jesus Christ, is the true God: it is no idolatry to worship him. Whosoever says that he is not God makes us idolaters. But idolatry is to us an abomination." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oidamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
