The apostle John emphasizes the seriousness of harboring hatred, suggesting that it is not merely a lesser sin but akin to murder in God's eyes. This reflects the heart's condition, which is central to biblical teaching. The use of "brother" indicates a fellow believer, highlighting the importance of love and unity within the Christian community. Historically, this teaching would have been radical, as it challenges the external adherence to the law, focusing instead on internal transformation.<p><b>and you know that eternal life does not reside in a murderer</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the incompatibility of hatred with the Christian life, which is characterized by love and eternal life. The assurance "you know" suggests that this is a foundational truth understood by believers. Eternal life, a key theme in John's writings, is not just a future promise but a present reality that transforms behavior. The statement implies that a lifestyle marked by hatred is evidence of the absence of eternal life. This aligns with other scriptural teachings, such as <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, where Paul lists the works of the flesh, including hatred and murder, as barriers to inheriting the kingdom of God. Theologically, this reflects the transformative power of the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to love as Christ loved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely facing internal conflicts and false teachings, which John addresses by emphasizing love and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain_and_abel.htm">Cain and Abel</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of 1 <a href="/bsb/john/3.htm">John 3</a> includes a reference to Cain, who murdered his brother Abel, serving as a historical example of hatred leading to murder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_hatred.htm">The Seriousness of Hatred</a></b><br>Hatred is equated with murder in God's eyes, highlighting the gravity of harboring ill will towards others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_condition.htm">The Heart's Condition</a></b><br>Our internal attitudes and emotions are as significant as our external actions.

Scripture consistently teaches that God&#8217;s moral standards apply to every person (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>: &#8220;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221;; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a> reminds us that &#8220;we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ&#8221;). By opening with &#8220;Everyone,&#8221; the apostle removes any wiggle room; what follows is universally true.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who hates his brother</b><p>Hatred is more than a passing irritation&#8212;it is a settled hostility of the heart. Jesus linked such inward animosity to outward violence in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, where anger with a brother puts one &#8220;in danger of the fire of hell.&#8221; <a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a> commands, &#8220;You must not hate your brother in your heart,&#8221; showing that this standard reaches back to the Law. In <a href="/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9-11</a>, John has already said that whoever &#8220;hates his brother is in the darkness.&#8221; Hatred violates the new commandment Jesus gave in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> to &#8220;love one another,&#8221; which marks genuine discipleship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a murderer</b><p>John states the consequence bluntly: hatred places a person in the same moral category as a murderer. This echoes Jesus&#8217; teaching that the seed of murder lies in the heart (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). Cain&#8217;s story in <a href="/bsb/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a> shows how unchecked resentment blossomed into the first murder&#8212;hatred is the soil in which violence grows. <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a> warns against rejoicing over an enemy&#8217;s downfall, underscoring that malicious desires already transgress God&#8217;s law. By God&#8217;s measure, the inward disposition and the outward act share the same moral guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you know</b><p>John appeals to the readers&#8217; settled knowledge. Believers are not left guessing about God&#8217;s view; the Spirit and the Word have made it clear (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>, &#8220;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers&#8221;). Jesus affirmed that His disciples would &#8220;know the truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31-32</a>), and Paul adds that Scripture makes us &#8220;wise for salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>). John expects the church to recognize the incompatibility between hatred and eternal life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that eternal life does not reside in a murderer</b><p>The verb &#8220;reside&#8221; (abide) pictures a permanent home. Eternal life cannot settle down in a heart harboring murderous hatred. <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a> says that those who practice the works of the flesh, including &#8220;hatred&#8221; and &#8220;fits of rage,&#8221; &#8220;will not inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a> lists &#8220;murderers&#8221; among those consigned to the lake of fire. Paul writes in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a> that willful sinners &#8220;will not inherit the kingdom.&#8221; Eternal life is Christ&#8217;s life within us (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>), and it bears the fruit of love, not hate (<a href="/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a> teaches that hatred toward a fellow believer is no trivial matter; it places the hater in the same moral standing as a murderer and exposes a heart devoid of eternal life. Because God&#8217;s standard reaches beyond outward actions to inner attitudes, genuine faith is proven by love. Where Christ&#8217;s life abides, love will increasingly replace hostility, confirming that we have truly passed from death to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - As in <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>, St. John passes at once from not loving to hating, treating the two as equivalent. He takes no account of the neutral ground of indifference. He that is not for his brother is against him. Indifference is hate quiescent, there being nothing to excite it. Love is the only security against hate. And as every one who does not love is potentially a hater, so every hater is potentially a murderer. A murderer is a hater who expresses his hatred in the most emphatic way. A hater who does not murder abstains for various reasons from this extreme way of expressing his hate. But the temper of the two men is the same; and it is obvious (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "ye know what needs no evidence") that every murderer is incapable of possessing eternal life. It is the murderous temper, not the act of homicide, that excludes from eternal life. St. John, of course, does not mean that murder is an unpardonable sin; but he shows that hate and death go together, as love and life, and that the two pairs are mutually exclusive. How can life and the desire to extinguish life be compatible? It is very forced to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as either "destroyer of <span class="accented">his own</span> soul," or "destroyer of the hated man's <span class="accented">soul</span>," by provoking him to return hate for hate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
