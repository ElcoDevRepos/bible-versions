The Greek word for "perfected" (&#964;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#964;&#945;&#953;) suggests a process that reaches its intended goal. This reflects the transformative power of God's love, which is not static but dynamic, growing and maturing in the lives of believers. The context of 1 John highlights the importance of love as a defining characteristic of the Christian community, echoing Jesus' commandment to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The perfecting of love is a sign of spiritual maturity and alignment with God's will.<p><b>so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment</b><br>The "day of judgment" refers to the eschatological event when all individuals will be held accountable before God. Confidence (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;) here implies boldness and assurance, not arrogance. This confidence is rooted in the believers' relationship with God, characterized by love and obedience. The assurance of salvation and the absence of fear in facing judgment are themes that resonate with other New Testament writings, such as <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, which declares no condemnation for those in Christ. This confidence is a result of living in accordance with God's love and commands.<p><b>for in this world we are just like Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the identification of believers with Christ. Being "just like Him" (&#954;&#945;&#952;&#974;&#962; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;) suggests a profound spiritual union and imitation of Christ's character and mission. In the context of 1 John, this likeness is primarily expressed through love, righteousness, and obedience. The world (&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;) often represents a system opposed to God, yet believers are called to reflect Christ's nature within it. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, which speaks of being conformed to the image of Christ. The transformative work of the Holy Spirit enables believers to live out this likeness, serving as a testimony to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely a community of believers facing challenges from false teachings and needing reassurance of their faith and identity in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_judgment.htm">The Day of Judgment</a></b><br>A future event in Christian eschatology where all individuals will be judged by God.

Whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in this way&#8221; points back to that abiding relationship. The flow is: God pours His love into us (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>); we dwell in that love; and the very experience of mutual abiding is the proof God gives.<p>&#8226; Earlier, John said, &#8220;If we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>). The same principle is now restated and expanded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Love has been perfected among us</b><p>&#8220;Perfected&#8221; speaks of reaching its intended goal.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s love is not a vague feeling; it reaches completion as believers actively love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; This perfected love is shared &#8220;among us,&#8221; a present reality in the church (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Because love originates with God (<a href="/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7</a>) and is worked out in our lives (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>), its completeness is evidence that we truly belong to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that we may have confidence on the day of judgment</b><p>Perfected love produces assurance, not anxiety.<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Confidence (parr&#275;sia) appears earlier: &#8220;Little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink back&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The coming judgment is real (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>), yet believers who stand in Christ can anticipate that day with boldness because punishment has already been borne by Jesus (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For in this world we are just like Him</b><p>John moves from future assurance to present identity.<p>&#8226; &#8220;As He is&#8221; points to the risen, glorified Christ, who is righteous and accepted before the Father (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;So also are we&#8221; declares the believer&#8217;s union with Him now (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications<p>&#8211; We share His nature: &#8220;Partakers of the divine nature&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>).<p>&#8211; We share His mission: &#8220;As You sent Me into the world, I have sent them&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a>).<p>&#8211; We share His victory over fear: &#8220;Peace I leave with you&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>Because He is accepted, we are accepted; because He is righteous, we are declared righteous (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a> assures believers that the observable, maturing love of God in their lives is God&#8217;s own evidence that they belong to Him.
