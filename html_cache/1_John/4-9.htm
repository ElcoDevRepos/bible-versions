In the context of 1 John, the apostle John addresses a community facing false teachings, reminding them of the foundational truth of God's love. The phrase "revealed among us" underscores the incarnation, where God's love is made manifest in a way that is visible and experiential. This revelation is not abstract but is demonstrated in the historical event of Jesus Christ's coming. The concept of revelation is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word becomes flesh, and in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God's love is demonstrated through Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>God sent His one and only Son into the world,</b><br>The sending of the "one and only Son" highlights the uniqueness and divinity of Jesus Christ. The term "one and only" (often translated as "only begotten") signifies the special relationship between the Father and the Son, affirming the pre-existence and deity of Christ. This act of sending is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child born to us, and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which predicts the ruler from Bethlehem. The phrase "into the world" indicates the mission of Jesus, who enters a fallen world to bring redemption. This mission is echoed in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God's love is expressed through the giving of His Son for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>so that we might live through Him.</b><br>The purpose of Christ's coming is life-giving, offering eternal life to those who believe. This life is not merely biological but spiritual and eternal, a theme prevalent in John's writings (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). The phrase "live through Him" suggests a union with Christ, where believers participate in His life, death, and resurrection. This concept is further explored in Paul's epistles, such as <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of being crucified with Christ and living by faith in Him. The life offered through Christ is a fulfillment of the promise of abundant life and is a stark contrast to the death brought by sin, as outlined in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who demonstrates His love by sending His Son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as God's "one and only Son," sent into the world to provide life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>The realm into which Jesus was sent, representing humanity in need of salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, providing insight into the nature of God's love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, encouraged to understand and live out the love of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_love.htm">Understanding God's Love</a></b><br>God's love is not abstract but demonstrated through action&#8212;sending His Son.<br><br>Reflect on the depth of love that involves sacrifice and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_christ's_coming.htm">The Purpose of Christ's Coming</a></b><br>Jesus was sent so that we might have life, indicating a transformation from spiritual death to life.<br><br>Consider how this purpose affects our daily living and priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_through_christ.htm">Living Through Christ</a></b><br>Our life in Christ is not just about existence but thriving in a relationship with God.<br><br>Evaluate how living through Christ changes our interactions and decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unique_sonship_of_christ.htm">The Unique Sonship of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is described as the "one and only Son," emphasizing His unique role in salvation.<br><br>Acknowledge the exclusivity and sufficiency of Christ in God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/manifestation_of_love_in_community.htm">Manifestation of Love in Community</a></b><br>As recipients of God's love, we are called to manifest this love within our communities.<br><br>Identify practical ways to demonstrate God's love to others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_4_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 4:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_9_God_s_love_via_Jesus_birth.htm">How does 1 John 4:9 demonstrate God's love through Jesus' incarnation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_God_s_Son_reveal_about_Him.htm">What does "God sent His one and only Son" reveal about God's nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Show_God_s_love_daily_to_others_2.htm">How can we reflect God's love in our daily interactions with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Both_show_God_s_love_through_Jesus.htm">Connect 1 John 4:9 with John 3:16.

Beware of the inadequate and misleading rendering "towards us" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It means <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>, and belongs to "manifested," as <a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> plainly shows. We must not connect together "the love of God in us," still less "the love of God toward us," as one idea. "In us" means "in our case," and the whole may be paraphrased: "A transcendent manifestation of the love of God has been made in regard to us, in that he hath sent," etc. The verse might serve as a summary of St. John's Gospel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> as applied to Christ is peculiar to St. John; it and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> are the key-words of the passage. "This is love indeed; it is his <span class="accented">only</span> Son whom he has sent, and he has sent him to give us life." Note the double article - "his Son, yes, his Only Begotten." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This is how</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
