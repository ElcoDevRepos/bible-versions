The term "beloved" reflects the deep affection and love God has for His people, echoing the language used in the Gospels when God refers to Jesus as His beloved Son (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The concept of being "children of God" is central to the New Testament, highlighting the intimate relationship between believers and God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16-17</a>). This status is not earned but granted through faith in Jesus Christ, signifying a transformation from being children of wrath (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>) to being part of God's family.<p><b>and what we will be has not yet been revealed</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the mystery surrounding the future state of believers. While believers are currently children of God, the full extent of what this entails in the eschatological sense is not yet fully disclosed. This reflects the tension between the "already" and "not yet" aspects of Christian theology. Paul also speaks of this future transformation in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, where he describes the change that will occur at the resurrection. The lack of full revelation encourages believers to live by faith, trusting in God's promises for the future.<p><b>We know that when Christ appears</b><br>The phrase points to the second coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. The certainty of Christ's return is affirmed throughout the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). This event is anticipated with hope and expectation, as it will bring about the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The term "appears" suggests a visible and undeniable manifestation of Christ, contrasting with His first coming in humility.<p><b>we will be like Him</b><br>This promise of transformation is a profound aspect of Christian hope. Being "like Him" refers to the moral and spiritual likeness to Christ that believers will attain. This transformation is part of the sanctification process, which will be completed at Christ's return (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>). The likeness to Christ includes sharing in His glory and righteousness, as well as being free from sin and its effects (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>).<p><b>for we will see Him as He is</b><br>The phrase indicates that believers will have a direct and unobstructed vision of Christ in His glory. This beatific vision is a theme found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, where Paul speaks of seeing "face to face." The ability to see Christ "as He is" implies a deep, personal knowledge and communion with Him, which is the ultimate fulfillment of the believer's longing. This vision will transform believers, as seeing Christ in His true nature will complete their sanctification and glorification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Refers to believers who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and are adopted into God's family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_appearing.htm">Christ's Appearing</a></b><br>The future event when Jesus Christ will return, also known as the Second Coming, where believers will see Him in His glorified state.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, our identity is rooted in being children of God.

The context must prevail. "Our future state is not yet made manifest. We know that on its manifestation we shall find ourselves like God." The two things will be contemporaneous. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes the following anecdote: "When some heathen converts to Christianity were translating a Catechism into their own language, they came upon <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>. They stopped. 'No; it is too much,' they said; 'let us write that we shall be permitted to kiss his feet.'"

It does not mean that the seeing God is a <span class="accented">proof</span> or <span class="accented">sign</span> of our being like him (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), but the <span class="accented">cause</span> of our being like him: "We shall be like him, <span class="accented">because we</span> shall see him." God is light (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), and light is <span class="accented">seen.</span> In this life <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> we cannot see the light of the Divine nature "as it is," but only as it is reflected; and the reflected light cannot transmit to us the nature of the Divine original, though it prepares us to receive it. Hereafter the sight, "face to face" (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), of the Light itself will illuminate us through end through, and we shall become like it.
