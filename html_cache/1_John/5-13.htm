The Apostle John, traditionally understood to be the author, writes with authority as an eyewitness of Jesus Christ. The phrase "these things" refers to the contents of the entire epistle, which emphasizes themes of love, obedience, and truth. The letter serves as a pastoral guide to ensure the readers' faith is grounded in the true teachings of Christ, countering false doctrines prevalent at the time.<p><b>to you who believe</b><br>John addresses believers, those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. This community likely consisted of both Jewish and Gentile Christians. The early church faced challenges from Gnostic teachings, which denied the humanity of Christ and promoted secret knowledge. By affirming belief, John reinforces the foundational Christian doctrine that faith in Jesus is essential for salvation.<p><b>in the name of the Son of God</b><br>The "name" signifies the authority and character of Jesus Christ. In biblical times, a name represented the essence of a person. By believing in the name of the Son of God, believers acknowledge Jesus' divine nature and messianic role. This phrase connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, which speaks of receiving power to become children of God through belief in His name.<p><b>so that you may know</b><br>John emphasizes assurance of salvation. The Greek word for "know" (ginosko) implies a deep, experiential knowledge. This assurance counters the uncertainty propagated by false teachers. The certainty of eternal life is a recurring theme in John's writings, providing comfort and confidence to believers.<p><b>that you have eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is a present possession for believers, not just a future promise. It signifies a quality of life that begins now and continues forever, characterized by a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in Jesus' teachings, such as in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where eternal life is defined as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ. The assurance of eternal life is a cornerstone of Christian hope, affirming the believer's secure position in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, specifically those who believe in the name of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The central promise and assurance given to believers, a key theme in John's writings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.

John reminds believers that they are not trying to earn a place in God&#8217;s household&#8212;their trust in Jesus has already brought them in (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26</a>).<p>&#8226; This pastoral tone echoes Jesus&#8217; promise in <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>: &#8220;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the name of the Son of God</b><p>&#8220;Name&#8221; carries the idea of character, authority, and rightful claim (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).

CONCLUSION OF EPISTLE; without, however, any marked break between this section and the last On the contrary, the prominent thought of <span class="accented">eternal life through faith in the Son of God</span> is continued for final development. This topic is the main idea alike of the Gospel (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>) and of the Epistle, with this difference - in the Gospel the purpose is that we may <span class="accented">have</span> eternal life; in the Epistle, that we may <span class="accented">know</span> that we have eternal life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have written to you</span> sums up the Epistle as a whole. At the outset the apostle said, "These things we write, that our joy [yours as well as mine] may be fulfilled;" and now, as he draws to a close, he says the same thing in other words. Their joy is the knowledge that they have eternal life through belief in the Son of God. There is considerable variety of reading in this verse, but that of the T.R., represented by the Authorized Version, is a manifest simplification. That represented by the Revised Version is probably right. The awkwardness of the last clause produced various alterations with a view to greater smoothness. The verse, both as regards construction and meaning, should be carefully compared with <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>. In both we have the epexegetic addition at the end. In both we have St. John's favourite <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, expressing the very strongest belief; motion to and repose upon the object of belief. In both we have the remarkable expression, "believe on his <span class="accented">Name."</span> This is no mere periphrasis for "believe on him." Names in Jewish history were so often significant, being sometimes given by God himself, that they served not merely to distinguish one man from another, but to indicate his character. So also with the Divine Name: it suggests the Divine attributes.
