Biblically, light often symbolizes purity and divine truth (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The concept of walking suggests a continuous, active lifestyle, not a one-time event. In the cultural context of the early church, walking in the light would contrast with the darkness of sin and ignorance prevalent in the pagan world. This phrase calls believers to live in a manner consistent with God's character.<p><b>as He is in the light</b><br>God is the ultimate source of light, representing His perfect holiness and truth (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). This phrase emphasizes the standard of divine purity and truth that believers are called to emulate. It reflects the nature of God as revealed in the Old Testament, where light is associated with God's presence and guidance (<a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>). The call to be in the light as God is in the light underscores the transformative power of a relationship with Him.<p><b>we have fellowship with one another</b><br>Fellowship, or "koinonia" in Greek, denotes a deep, spiritual communion among believers. This fellowship is rooted in shared faith and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. In the early church, fellowship was a vital aspect of community life, involving shared meals, prayers, and mutual support (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>). This phrase highlights the unity and love that should characterize the body of Christ, transcending social and cultural barriers.<p><b>and the blood of Jesus His Son</b><br>The blood of Jesus is central to Christian theology, symbolizing His sacrificial death and atonement for sin. In the Old Testament, blood sacrifices were required for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' blood fulfills and surpasses these sacrifices, offering a once-for-all atonement (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). This phrase underscores the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the foundation for cleansing and redemption.<p><b>cleanses us from all sin</b><br>Cleansing from sin is a core promise of the New Covenant, prophesied in the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). This cleansing is both a legal declaration of righteousness and an ongoing process of sanctification. The phrase assures believers of complete forgiveness and the transformative power of Christ's work. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration, emphasizing the sufficiency of Jesus' sacrifice for all sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of Christianity, whose sacrificial death and resurrection provide the means for cleansing from sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers to whom John was writing, facing challenges of false teachings and needing encouragement in their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_light.htm">The Light</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's holiness, truth, and purity, representing the divine nature and moral perfection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fellowship.htm">Fellowship</a></b><br>The spiritual unity and shared life among believers, rooted in their common relationship with God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_the_light.htm">Walking in the Light</a></b><br>Walking in the light involves living in accordance with God's truth and holiness.

When we do, two gifts emerge: authentic community with fellow believers and the ever-effective cleansing of Jesus&#8217; blood, which removes every trace of sin&#8217;s stain.

He again speaks conditionally <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, and does so until <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>; after which the participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> represents the conditional clause. The change of verbs is significant: we <span class="accented">walk</span>, God <span class="accented">is</span>, in the light. We move through time; he is in eternity. Our activity involves change; his does not. Like the sun, he both is Light and dwells in the light; and <span class="cmt_word">if we walk in the light,</span> which is his atmosphere, <span class="cmt_word">we have fellowship one with another.</span> Darkness is an <span class="accented">unsocial</span> condition, and this the light expels. From verse 6 we might have expected, "we have fellowship with him;" and some inferior authorities read <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But St. John's repetitions are not mere repetitions: the thought is always recur or reset to carry us a step further (cf. verses 3, 4). Having fellowship with one another is a sure result of that fellowship with God which is involved in walking in the light. "Here is a reply to those who would restrain Catholic communion to their own sect" (Wordsworth). Another result of walking in the light is that the blood of Jesus (his sacrificial death) cleanses us day by day continually (present tense) from our frequent sins of frailty. This cleansing is not the same as forgiveness of sins (verse 9). The latter is the case of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the man that is bathed (<a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>); the former is the frequent washing of the feet (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm">Revelation 22:14</a>).
