In the biblical context, love is a central theme, especially in the writings of John. The absence of fear in love reflects the assurance and security found in a relationship with God. In the cultural context of the early church, fear was often associated with judgment and the unknown, but the love of God provides a sense of peace and confidence. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, where believers are described as receiving a spirit of adoption rather than a spirit of fear.<p><b>but perfect love drives out fear</b><br>Perfect love refers to the mature, complete love that comes from God. This love is not just an emotion but an active force that dispels fear. The concept of perfect love is rooted in the nature of God Himself, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>, which states that "God is love." The driving out of fear suggests a cleansing or purifying action, similar to how light dispels darkness. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke of love as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>because fear involves punishment</b><br>Fear, in this context, is linked to the anticipation of punishment or judgment. In the historical setting of the early church, believers faced persecution and the fear of divine judgment. However, the assurance of salvation through Christ removes the fear of eternal punishment. This is consistent with the message of <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, which declares that there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. The understanding of punishment here is both temporal and eternal, highlighting the comprehensive nature of God's redemptive love.<p><b>The one who fears has not been perfected in love</b><br>This statement serves as both a challenge and an encouragement to believers. It suggests that fear is an indicator of incomplete understanding or acceptance of God's love. The process of being perfected in love is ongoing, involving spiritual growth and maturity. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of sanctification, where believers are continually being transformed into the likeness of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). The call to be perfected in love is a call to deeper faith and trust in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely facing challenges of false teachings and needing reassurance of God's love and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_love.htm">God's Love</a></b><br>Central theme in John's writings, emphasizing the transformative power of divine love in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_perfect_love.htm">Understanding Perfect Love</a></b><br>Perfect love is mature and complete, reflecting God's nature.

Love here means the <span class="accented">principle</span> of love in general; it must not be limited to God's love to us, or our love to God, or our love of the brethren. Love and fear coexist only where love is not yet perfect. Perfect love will absolutely exclude fear as surely as perfect union excludes all separation. It is self-interested love that fears; pure and unselfish love has no fear. Yet nothing but perfect love must be allowed to cast out fear. Otherwise this text might be made an excuse for taking the most unwarrantable liberties with Almighty God. To cease to fear without attaining to perfect love is to be irreverent and presumptuous. Hence the apostle is once more pointing out an ideal to which Christians must aspire, but to which no one attains in this life. There is a fear, as Bede points out, which prepares the way for love, and which comes only to depart again when its work is done. <span class="cmt_word">Because fear hath punishment.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> must not be rendered indefinitely "suffering" or "torment" (<a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>; Wisd. 11:14; 2 Macc. 4:38).

It is the day of judgment and fear in reference to that day that is under consideration; and fear of punishment is in itself punishment by anticipation. Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, introducing a contrary and then a contrast back again: "There is no fear in love; nay, perfect love casteth out fear: but he that habitually feareth [present participle] is not made perfect in love." The dread of punishment may deter men from sin; but it cannot lead them to righteousness. For that we need either the sense of duty or the feeling of love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">There is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
