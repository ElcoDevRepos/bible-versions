In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a symbolic act for priests, prophets, and kings, signifying their divine appointment and empowerment (<a href="/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). In the New Testament, this anointing is understood as the work of the Holy Spirit, who indwells and empowers believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a>). The "Holy One" is a title often used for God, emphasizing His purity and separateness from sin (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). In the context of 1 John, it likely refers to Jesus Christ, who imparts the Holy Spirit to His followers (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). This anointing enables believers to discern truth from falsehood, a critical theme in John's epistle as he addresses the presence of false teachers and antichrists (1 <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18-19</a>).<p><b>and all of you know the truth</b><br>The phrase underscores the idea that true believers possess an inherent understanding of divine truth through the Holy Spirit's guidance (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, rooted in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The early church faced challenges from Gnostic teachings, which claimed secret knowledge and denied fundamental truths about Christ's incarnation and deity. John's assurance that "all of you know the truth" serves as a counter to these heresies, affirming that the gospel message is accessible and understandable to all believers, not just a select few. This truth is consistent with the teachings of the apostles and the broader narrative of Scripture, which emphasizes the clarity and sufficiency of God's revelation (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_one.htm">The Holy One</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is the source of the anointing mentioned in the verse.

As Christ was anointed with the Spirit in all fullness, so each Christian is anointed with him in his measure (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21, 22</a>). The twenty-first 'Catechetical Lecture' of St. Cyril, "On the Holy Chrism," should be read in illustration of this verse. "In apostolic language, each Christian is in due measure himself a Christ, empowered by the gift of the Holy Spirit to announce the truth which he has learnt, to apply the atonement which he has received, to establish the kingdom which he believes to be universal" (Westcott).
