In the early church, false teachings and heresies, such as Gnosticism, denied the true nature of Christ. Confession of Jesus as the Son of God is a fundamental Christian doctrine (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>). The phrase underscores the necessity of discernment in spiritual matters, as not all spiritual experiences or teachings are from God. This aligns with Jesus' warning in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> about false prophets.<p><b>This is the spirit of the antichrist,</b><br>The term "antichrist" refers to any force or individual opposing Christ and His teachings. In the context of 1 John, it highlights the presence of false teachers who deny Jesus' incarnation and divinity. The concept of the antichrist is further explored in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, where it is associated with end-times deception. The spirit of the antichrist is characterized by opposition to Christ's truth and authority.<p><b>which you have heard is coming</b><br>This phrase indicates that the early Christians were already warned about the coming of false teachers and the spirit of the antichrist. Jesus Himself spoke of false prophets in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>, and Paul warned the Ephesian elders in <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>. The anticipation of such challenges was part of the apostolic teaching, preparing believers to stand firm in their faith.<p><b>and which is already in the world at this time.</b><br>John asserts that the spirit of the antichrist was not only a future threat but a present reality. This reflects the ongoing struggle between truth and deception within the church. The presence of false teachings in the first-century church is documented in other New Testament writings, such as Galatians and Colossians. This phrase serves as a call to vigilance and faithfulness, reminding believers that spiritual discernment is crucial in every age.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of Christianity, whose divinity and humanity are affirmed by true believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/antichrist.htm">Antichrist</a></b><br>A term used to describe those who oppose or deny Christ, embodying the spirit of deception and falsehood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, facing challenges from false teachings and needing guidance on discerning truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals spreading teachings contrary to the gospel, denying the true nature of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_spirits.htm">Discernment of Spirits</a></b><br>Believers must test the spirits to determine whether they are from God, using the confession of Jesus Christ as a key criterion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_false_teachings.htm">Recognition of False Teachings</a></b><br>Understanding that any teaching denying Jesus' divinity and humanity is not from God helps protect the faith community from deception.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_the_antichrist_spirit.htm">Awareness of the Antichrist Spirit</a></b><br>The spirit of the antichrist is already present in the world, manifesting through false teachings and opposition to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_truth.htm">Commitment to Truth</a></b><br>Upholding the truth of Jesus Christ as both fully God and fully man is essential for maintaining the integrity of the Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_vigilance.htm">Community Vigilance</a></b><br>Encouraging one another in the faith and holding each other accountable to sound doctrine strengthens the church against false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_4_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 4:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_3_on_denying_Jesus_spirit.htm">How does 1 John 4:3 define the spirit that denies Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Modern_antichrist_spirit_examples.htm">What are modern examples of the "spirit of the antichrist" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_discern_spirits.htm">How can believers discern spirits as instructed in 1 John 4:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_John_4_3_Matt_24_24_on_falsehoods.htm">How does 1 John 4:3 connect with Matthew 24:24 about false prophets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_3_s_role_in_countering_heresy.htm">How should 1 John 4:3 influence our response to false teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_3_on_antichrist_spirit.htm">What does 1 John 4:3 say about recognizing the spirit of the antichrist?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_spirit_denies_Jesus_in_1_John_4_3.htm">How does 1 John 4:3 define the spirit that denies Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_incarnation_crucial.htm">Why is acknowledging Jesus' incarnation crucial according to 1 John 4:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_john_4_3_with_god's_mercy.htm">In 1 John 4:3, how do we reconcile the warning about denying Jesus with passages suggesting God&#8217;s inclusive mercy elsewhere in the Bible?

He takes for granted that behind teachings stand spirits, either holy or deceptive (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The command is to test all of them, because &#8220;every spirit&#8221; will ultimately side either with God or against Him. You and I are therefore called to vigilance, refusing blind acceptance while holding fast to what is true (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that does not confess Jesus</b><p>Confession means open agreement with God&#8217;s testimony about His Son.

Paul warned of workers who appear righteous yet are empowered by another source (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13&#8211;15</a>). Even dazzling displays can accompany error (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21&#8211;23</a>).

Here he shows the driving force behind such denial. Antichrist means both &#8220;against&#8221; and &#8220;instead of&#8221; Christ, a counterfeit that opposes while pretending to replace Him (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3&#8211;4</a>).

Scripture foresees a final antichrist figure, energized by Satan, who will deceive many (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8&#8211;10</a>).

Even in the first century, John could say, &#8220;many antichrists have appeared&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). Hostile influences infiltrate culture, religion, and thought (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).
