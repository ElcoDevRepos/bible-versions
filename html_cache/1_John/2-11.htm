In the biblical context, "brother" refers to fellow Christians, highlighting the importance of love within the Christian community. Hatred is contrary to the teachings of Jesus, who commanded His followers to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The use of "whoever" indicates that this warning applies universally to all believers, without exception. The concept of brotherly love is deeply rooted in the teachings of both the Old and New Testaments, with <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> instructing, "Love your neighbor as yourself."<p><b>is in the darkness</b><br>Darkness in Scripture often symbolizes sin, ignorance, and separation from God. In the Johannine writings, darkness is contrasted with light, which represents truth, righteousness, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Being "in the darkness" suggests a state of spiritual blindness and moral confusion, where one is unable to perceive or follow the truth. This condition is a result of rejecting the light of Christ, who is the true light of the world.<p><b>and walks in the darkness.</b><br>Walking in darkness implies a continuous lifestyle or pattern of behavior that is contrary to God's will. It suggests an active engagement in sin and a deliberate choice to live apart from the truth. This imagery of walking is used throughout Scripture to describe one's conduct or way of life (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>). The apostle Paul also uses similar language to urge believers to walk as children of light, emphasizing the transformative power of living in accordance with God's truth.<p><b>He does not know where he is going,</b><br>This phrase highlights the confusion and lack of direction experienced by those who live in spiritual darkness. Without the guidance of God's light, individuals are unable to discern the right path and are prone to making choices that lead to destruction. <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> states, "The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble." This lack of spiritual insight results in a life that is aimless and ultimately separated from God.<p><b>because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</b><br>Spiritual blindness is a condition where individuals are unable to perceive or understand spiritual truths. This blindness is a consequence of sin and a rejection of God's revelation. In <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, Paul speaks of the god of this age blinding the minds of unbelievers to prevent them from seeing the light of the gospel. The imagery of blindness underscores the severity of living in darkness, as it prevents individuals from recognizing their need for salvation and the truth found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing challenges such as false teachings and internal divisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concept_of_darkness.htm">The Concept of Darkness</a></b><br>Symbolic of sin, ignorance, and separation from God, often used in contrast to light, which represents truth, righteousness, and fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hatred.htm">The Danger of Hatred</a></b><br>Hatred towards others is a serious sin that blinds us spiritually and separates us from God.<br><br>It is essential to examine our hearts for any lingering resentment or bitterness and seek reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_the_light.htm">Walking in the Light</a></b><br>Walking in the light involves living in truth and love, reflecting God's character in our relationships.<br><br>We must strive to love others as Christ loves us, which is evidence of our fellowship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Spiritual blindness results from living in darkness, preventing us from seeing God's truth and direction for our lives.<br><br>Regular self-examination and repentance are necessary to ensure we are not blinded by sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_love.htm">The Importance of Love</a></b><br>Love is a fundamental commandment and the hallmark of a true Christian life.<br><br>Practicing love towards others, especially fellow believers, is a testimony of our faith and obedience to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_2_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 2:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_11_Hatred_blinds_spiritually.htm">How does 1 John 2:11 describe the impact of hatred on spiritual vision?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_walking_in_darkness_2.htm">What steps can you take to avoid "walking in the darkness"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_John_2_11_to_Jesus_love_teachings.htm">How does 1 John 2:11 connect with Jesus' teachings on love?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_love_your_brother_daily.htm">What practical ways can you "love your brother" in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_hatred_on_God_others.htm">How does harboring hatred affect your relationship with God and others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_11_on_spiritual_blindness.htm">How does 1 John 2:11 define spiritual blindness in a believer's life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_darkness_in_1_John_2_11.htm">What does "darkness" symbolize in 1 John 2:11, and how does it affect faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Hatred_s_link_to_spiritual_blindness.htm">How does hatred relate to spiritual blindness in 1 John 2:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_john_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 John 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_jaffa's_biblical_significance.htm">Do those who hate their brother walk in darkness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible_miracle_examples.htm">What does the Bible teach about hate?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_john_recognize_jesus_post-baptism.htm">Did John the Baptist recognize Jesus after his baptism?

Note also the climax effected by the gradual increase of predicates: in verse 9 one, in verse 10 two, in verse 11 three. The brother-hater has darkness as his habitual condition and as the atmosphere in which he lives and works; and long ago (aorist) the continual darkness deprived him of the very power of sight, so that he is in ignorance as to the course he is taking.

"St. John scouts all the pretences of men to illumination which do not involve the practical acknowledgment of brotherhood.
