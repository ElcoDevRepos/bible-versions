The concept of "remaining" or "abiding" in Him is a recurring theme in Johannine literature, particularly in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>). It suggests a continuous, intimate relationship with God, characterized by faith and obedience. The assurance comes from the evidence of a transformed life and the presence of the Holy Spirit, which is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to His disciples (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<p><b>and He in us:</b><br>The mutual indwelling of God in the believer and the believer in God is a profound mystery that speaks to the depth of the Christian experience. This concept is rooted in the idea of covenant relationship, where God promises to be with His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). It also reflects the unity and fellowship that believers have with God through Christ, as seen in Jesus' prayer for unity in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>. This indwelling is not just a theological concept but a lived reality that impacts the believer's daily life.<p><b>He has given us of His Spirit.</b><br>The giving of the Spirit is a key element of the New Covenant, prophesied in the Old Testament (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>) and fulfilled in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). The Holy Spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>) and the source of spiritual life and power. The Spirit's presence in the believer is evidence of God's work and a seal of the believer's salvation. The Spirit also plays a crucial role in guiding, teaching, and empowering believers to live according to God's will (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, given to believers as a helper, comforter, and guide, signifying God's presence within us.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers to whom John was writing, facing challenges of false teachings and needing assurance of their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>Traditionally believed to be the location where John wrote this letter, a major city in Asia Minor with a significant early Christian community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading incorrect doctrines about Jesus and the nature of God, prompting John to affirm the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>The presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives is a confirmation that we are in Christ and He is in us.

In verses 1-7 the apostle says that confession of the Incarnation proves possession of the Spirit; and in verse 12 that love of the brethren proves the indwelling of God. He now (verse 13) goes on to say that possession of the Spirit proves the indwelling of God; and (verse 15) that confession of the Incarnation proves the same. So that these four facts - confession of the Incarnation, possession of the Spirit, love of our fellow-men, and indwelling of God - mutually involve one another. St. John does not say, "He has given us his Spirit," but "of his Spirit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>."
