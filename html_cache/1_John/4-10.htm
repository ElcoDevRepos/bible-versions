In the biblical context, love is not merely an emotion but an action and commitment. The Greek word used for love here is "agape," which signifies selfless, sacrificial love. This sets the stage for understanding God's nature and His actions towards humanity.<p><b>not that we loved God,</b><br>This highlights human inability and the natural state of humanity, which is estranged from God due to sin. <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a> supports this by stating that no one seeks God on their own. It underscores the idea that human love for God is not the starting point; rather, it is a response to His initiative.<p><b>but that He loved us</b><br>God's love is proactive and unconditional. This reflects the covenantal love seen throughout the Old Testament, where God consistently reaches out to His people despite their unfaithfulness. <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> echoes this sentiment, emphasizing God's love as the motivation for sending His Son.<p><b>and sent His Son</b><br>This refers to the incarnation of Jesus Christ, a central tenet of Christian faith. The sending of the Son is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speak of a coming Savior. It also reflects the Trinitarian relationship within the Godhead, where the Father sends the Son.<p><b>as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</b><br>The term "atoning sacrifice" is translated from the Greek word "hilasmos," which means propitiation or expiation. This concept is rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, particularly the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people. Jesus is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of these sacrifices, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>, providing a once-for-all atonement for sin. This underscores the belief in Jesus as the Messiah who reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The initiator of love, who sent His Son as an expression of His love for humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, sent as the atoning sacrifice, demonstrating the ultimate act of love by dying for our sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, who were being instructed in the true nature of love and the importance of recognizing Jesus' sacrificial role.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atoning_sacrifice.htm">Atoning Sacrifice</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus' sacrificial death, which atones for the sins of humanity, a central event in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_love.htm">Understanding True Love</a></b><br>True love originates from God, not from human effort.
