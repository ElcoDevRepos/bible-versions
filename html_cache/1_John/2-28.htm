"Little children" indicates a close relationship, similar to a spiritual father guiding his children. It emphasizes the need for spiritual growth and maturity. The term is used throughout John's letters to convey care and instruction, highlighting the intimate community of early Christians.<p><b>remain in Christ</b><br>Remaining in Christ is a central theme in John's writings, emphasizing the importance of abiding in a close, personal relationship with Jesus. This concept is rooted in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>, where He describes Himself as the vine and believers as the branches. Abiding in Christ involves continual faith, obedience, and reliance on Him, ensuring spiritual vitality and fruitfulness.<p><b>so that when He appears</b><br>This phrase refers to the anticipated second coming of Jesus Christ. The early church lived with the expectation of Christ's imminent return, a hope that provided motivation for holy living. The appearance of Christ is a future event prophesied in various scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, where Jesus' return is described as visible and glorious.<p><b>we may be confident and unashamed before Him</b><br>Confidence and lack of shame at Christ's coming are outcomes of a life lived in faithful obedience and relationship with Him. This assurance is contrasted with the fear and shame that would accompany those who have not remained faithful. The idea of standing confidently before Christ is echoed in passages like 1 <a href="/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17</a>, where love perfected in believers casts out fear.<p><b>at His coming</b><br>The coming of Christ, or Parousia, is a foundational doctrine in Christian eschatology. It signifies the culmination of history and the fulfillment of God's promises. This event is characterized by judgment and reward, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.
