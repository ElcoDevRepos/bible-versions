In the context of 1 John, the commandments refer primarily to the command to love one another (1 <a href="/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>). This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." The concept of keeping commandments is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where obedience to God's law was a covenantal requirement (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a>).<p><b>remains in God, and God in him.</b><br>The idea of mutual abiding is central to Johannine theology. It reflects the intimate relationship between the believer and God, akin to the vine and branches metaphor in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>. This mutual indwelling signifies a deep spiritual union, where the believer's life is sustained by God's presence. The concept of God dwelling with His people is also seen in the Old Testament, such as in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>).<p><b>And by this we know that He remains in us:</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme in John's writings. The phrase underscores the certainty believers can have regarding their relationship with God. It aligns with the purpose of John's epistle, which is to provide assurance of eternal life to believers (1 <a href="/john/5-13.htm">John 5:13</a>). The knowledge of God's indwelling is not based on feelings but on the evidence of a transformed life and obedience to His commandments.<p><b>by the Spirit He has given us.</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the means by which believers experience God's presence and assurance. The Spirit's role as a witness and guide is highlighted in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, where Jesus promises the Spirit of truth to His followers. The giving of the Spirit fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people. The Spirit's presence is a mark of the new covenant and a guarantee of our inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose presence is assured in those who keep His commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit given by God, serving as the assurance of His presence within believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_evidence_of_relationship.htm">Obedience as Evidence of Relationship</a></b><br>Keeping God's commandments is not just a duty but a demonstration of our relationship with Him.

The sentence forms the transition to the subject of the next section (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-6</a>), which is a sort of digression, the subject of love being mentioned in verse 7.
