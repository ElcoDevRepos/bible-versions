In the biblical context, "keeping His word" refers to living according to the teachings and commandments of Jesus Christ. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." The concept of obedience is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where adherence to God's law was a sign of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>). In the New Testament, this obedience is not merely legalistic but is a response to the grace and love received through Christ.<p><b>the love of God has been truly perfected in him</b><br>This phrase suggests that the love of God reaches its intended goal or maturity in those who obey His word. The Greek word for "perfected" (&#964;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#964;&#945;&#953;) implies completion or fulfillment. This reflects the transformative power of God's love, which is made complete in believers as they live out their faith. The idea of love being perfected is also seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-12.htm">John 4:12</a>, where it is stated that God's love is perfected in us when we love one another. This perfection is not about human effort but about the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life, producing the fruit of love (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>).<p><b>By this we know that we are in Him:</b><br>This phrase provides assurance of one's relationship with God. The concept of being "in Him" is a recurring theme in the writings of John, indicating a deep, abiding relationship with Christ (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>). It signifies union with Christ, where believers are spiritually connected to Him and share in His life. This assurance is not based on feelings but on the evidence of a transformed life characterized by obedience and love. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of covenant relationship, where being "in" God or Christ signifies belonging and identity (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing false teachings and needed encouragement to remain faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of 1 John, as the embodiment of God's love and the one whose teachings believers are called to keep.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_evidence_of_love.htm">Obedience as Evidence of Love</a></b><br>Keeping God's word is a tangible expression of our love for Him.
