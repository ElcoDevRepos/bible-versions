The phrase "the last hour" reflects the eschatological urgency present in the early church. This concept is rooted in the belief that the coming of Christ initiated the final phase of God's redemptive plan. The "last hour" is not a literal 60-minute period but a symbolic expression of the time between Christ's first and second coming. This aligns with other New Testament teachings, such as in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, which refers to these times as the "last days."<p><b>and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming,</b><br>The term "antichrist" is unique to the Johannine epistles, though the concept is present elsewhere in Scripture. The early Christians were aware of the prophecies concerning a future figure opposing Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>, which describes the "man of lawlessness." The expectation of an antichrist figure was part of the early church's eschatological teaching, reflecting Jewish apocalyptic literature that anticipated a climactic battle between good and evil.<p><b>so now many antichrists have appeared.</b><br>John identifies not just a singular antichrist but many "antichrists," indicating that the spirit of antichrist was already at work. This refers to individuals or groups who deny the true nature of Christ, as further explained in 1 <a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>. The presence of these antichrists serves as a warning to the church to remain vigilant against false teachings. This aligns with Jesus' warnings in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a> about false prophets and messiahs.<p><b>This is how we know it is the last hour.</b><br>The emergence of many antichrists is presented as evidence of the "last hour." This reflects the New Testament understanding that the presence of false teachers and opposition to Christ are signs of the end times. The early church lived with the expectation of Christ's imminent return, and the presence of antichrists was a confirmation of the eschatological timeline. This perspective encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith and discerning of truth, as emphasized throughout the epistle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, and a key figure in the early Christian church.

It is the last hour. What does this mean? There is scarcely room for doubt. The perishableness of the world has suggested the thought of its end, and St. John goes on to warn his readers that this thought is full of meaning to them; for they may recognize the time in which they are living as the last hour by the many antichrists that have arisen. "The last hour" can only mean <span class="accented">the last hour before the second coming of Christ.</span> Nothing but the unwillingness of Christians to admit that an apostle, and especially the Apostle St. John, could seem to be much in error about the nearness of the day of judgment, could have raised a question about language so plain. All explanations about its signifying the Christian dispensation, or the nearness of St. John's death, or the nearness of the destruction of Jerusalem, must be firmly set aside. How could the rising of antichrists show that the Christian dispensation had begun? It was Christ, not antichrist, that showed that? What had antichrists to do with St. John's death? or with the fall of Jerusalem, which, moreover, had fallen many years before this Epistle was written? Just as the apostles, even after the Resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), remained grossly ignorant of the <span class="accented">nature</span> of Christ's kingdom on earth, so to the last they remained ignorant of its <span class="accented">duration.</span> The primitive Church had not yet found its true perspective, and, in common with all Christians of the first age, the apostles believed that Christ would return soon, possibly within the lifetime of some then living. "Yea, I come quickly" (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>) was by them understood in the most literal sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;</span>. But it will not surprise those who remember Christ's very strong declaration (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>), to find even an apostle in ignorance as to the time of the second advent of Christ. But it may very reasonably and reverently be asked, What becomes of the inspiration of Scripture if an inspired writer tells the Church that the end of the world is near, when it is not near? The question of inspiration must follow that of interpretation, not lead it. Let us patiently examine the facts, and then try to frame a theory of inspiration that will cover them; not first frame our theory, and then force the facts to agree with it. But the question in its proper place requires an answer. The Old Testament prophets were often guided to utter language the Divine meaning of which they did not themselves understand. They uttered the words in one sense, and the words were true in a far higher sense, of which they scarcely dreamed. The same thing is true of the New Testament prophets, though in a less degree, because the gift of Pentecost had given them powers of insight which their predecessors had not possessed. The present text seems to be an illustration of this truth. We can hardly doubt that, in saying, "it is the last hour," St. John means to imply that within a few years, or possibly even less time, Christ will return to judgment. In this sense the statement is not true. But it may also mean that the last period in the world's history has begun; and in this sense we have good reason for believing that the statement is true. "That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" is not rhetoric, but sober fact. By the Divine standard times are measured, not according to their duration, but their importance; it is their meaning, not their extent, which gives them value. What are all the measureless prehistoric aeons of the material universe compared with the time since the creation of rational life? What are the thousands of years covered by the Old Testament compared with the portion of a century covered by the New? The great crisis in the history of the world, constituted by the life and death of Christ, will never be equaled until he comes again. When he ascended to heaven the last hour sounded. There may follow a silence (as it seemed to St. John) about the space of half an hour, but (as human experience may prove) of half a thousand centuries. Yet the duration of the period, as measured by man, will not alter its essential characteristics; it was, is, and will still remain, "the last hour." <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye heard</span> (when ye were instructed in the faith) <span class="cmt_word">that antichrist cometh</span> (is destined to come).

This was the teaching of the gospel (<a href="/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 23-26</a>; <a href="/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22, 23</a>; comp. <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). What does St. John mean by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>? The four passages (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) in which he uses the term do not enable us to answer the question with certainty. The predominant idea is that of <span class="accented">opposition</span> to Christ, and <span class="accented">rivalry</span> of Christ, rather than merely of <span class="accented">counterfeiting</span> Christ. If <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were formed on the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean "vice-Christ, vicar of Christ." It is, however, analogous to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Greek for a counterfeit Christ is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). But we are left in doubt whether this rival of Christ is a principle or a person. None of the four passages is decisive. Here we are not sure whether the arising of many antichrists proves that the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist is already in the world, or that by them the way is fully prepared for the one <span class="accented">personal</span> antichrist. Either the existence of the antichristian character, or the approach of the antichrist, is given as evidence that the day of the Lord is at hand. The latter is the more probable. A great personal opponent to the personal Christ seems to be indicated both by St. John and St. Paul (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-8</a>). The Jews expected a personal opponent of the Messiah to precede the Messiah - Armillus, Gog, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the like (Ezekiel 38:39; <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>); and Christians from the earliest times have expected a similar prelude to the return of the Messiah. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is absolutely peculiar to St. John in the New Testament. By the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> he probably means those early heretical teachers, who in various ways denied the Incarnation, and were thus forerunners of the antichrist - the Nicolaitanes, Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Diotrephes, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. Besides these there are practical antichrists. "Let us mark, not the tongue but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep silent awhile: ask the life. If the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists if deeds are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out, but many not yet manifest, who have not gone out at all" (St. Augustine). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Children,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Paidia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3813.htm">Strong's 3813: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter diminutive of pais; a childling, i.e., an infant, or a half-grown boy or girl; figuratively, an immature Christian.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
