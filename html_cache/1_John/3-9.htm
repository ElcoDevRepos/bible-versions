In the context of 1 John, the apostle John addresses the nature of true believers. The concept of being "born of God" is rooted in the idea of regeneration, a fundamental change in a person's nature through the Holy Spirit. This transformation results in a new disposition that is incompatible with a lifestyle of habitual sin. The refusal to practice sin is not about achieving sinless perfection but indicates a break from the pattern of sin that characterizes those who are not in Christ. This aligns with Paul's teachings in <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>, where believers are called to live in newness of life, having died to sin.<p><b>because God&#8217;s seed abides in him</b><br>The "seed" here is often understood as the divine principle or nature imparted to believers at the moment of salvation. This seed represents the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, which empowers believers to live righteously. The imagery of seed suggests growth and development, indicating that the believer's life will increasingly reflect God's character. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, where believers are described as being born again through the imperishable seed of the Word of God. The abiding presence of this seed ensures that the believer's life is marked by a continual transformation.<p><b>he cannot go on sinning</b><br>This phrase underscores the incompatibility of a regenerated life with a lifestyle of ongoing sin. The Greek verb tense used here suggests a continuous action, indicating that a true believer will not persist in a habitual pattern of sin. This does not imply that believers will never sin, as John acknowledges in 1 <a href="/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8-10</a>, but rather that their lives will not be characterized by unrepentant sinfulness. The transformative work of the Holy Spirit produces a conviction of sin and a desire for holiness, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>, where the Spirit and the flesh are in opposition.<p><b>because he has been born of God</b><br>The phrase reiterates the source of the believer's new nature. Being "born of God" is a spiritual rebirth that results in a fundamental change in identity and behavior. This new birth is a work of God, not of human effort, as emphasized in <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>. The new birth brings believers into the family of God, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. This transformation is a fulfillment of the promise of the New Covenant, where God writes His laws on the hearts of His people, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. The assurance of this new birth is the basis for the believer's confidence in living a life that pleases God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians facing challenges such as false teachings and moral dilemmas.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being whose seed abides in believers, enabling them to live righteously.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers (Born of God)</a></b><br>Individuals who have accepted Christ and are transformed by God's presence within them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The moral failing or transgression against God's law, which believers are called to reject.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_seed.htm">Understanding God's Seed</a></b><br>The term "seed" (Greek: sperma) signifies the divine nature and life imparted to believers, enabling them to live righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_birth.htm">The New Birth</a></b><br>Being "born of God" is a spiritual rebirth that fundamentally changes a person's nature and relationship with sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incompatibility_of_sin.htm">The Incompatibility of Sin</a></b><br>A true believer, transformed by God's presence, cannot continue in habitual sin because it contradicts their new identity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_victory.htm">Living in Victory</a></b><br>Believers are empowered by the Holy Spirit to overcome sin and live in accordance with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>The evidence of a transformed life provides assurance of one's salvation and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_3_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 3:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_3_9_Sin_vs_God_s_seed.htm">How does 1 John 3:9 define the relationship between sin and God's seed?

While believers still battle and sometimes stumble, the overall direction of their lives moves toward righteousness, giving visible evidence of the inward miracle of the new birth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - Sin is absolutely incompatible with being born of God, as is shown by the presence or absence of brotherly love. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Having stated that every one that doeth sin is of the devil, St. John now states the opposite truth, but from the other side; not "every one that doeth no sin is of God," which hardly needs to be stated; but <span class="cmt_word">every one that is begotten of God doeth no sin,</span> which is startling. Who, then, can be begotten of God? But the statement is similar to that in verse 6, and is to be similarly understood. So far as any man sins, his regeneration is incomplete.

An act is different from a state of sin. This is an ideal to which every Christian is bound to aspire - inability to sin. But to some extent this ideal is a fact in the case of every true Christian.
