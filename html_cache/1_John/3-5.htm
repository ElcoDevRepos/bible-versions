The appearance of Christ is a foundational truth in Christian doctrine, affirming the historical reality of Jesus' life on earth. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which foretold the coming of Immanuel, and is fulfilled in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' birth (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). The term "appeared" underscores the visible and tangible nature of Christ's presence, contrasting with the spiritual anticipation of the Messiah in the Old Testament.<p><b>to take away sins</b><br>The purpose of Christ's appearance is clearly stated: to remove the burden of sin. This reflects the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where sacrifices were made to atone for sin, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> with the Day of Atonement. Jesus is identified as the ultimate sacrifice, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This act of taking away sins is central to the New Covenant, fulfilling the law and the prophets, and providing a means for reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p><b>and in Him there is no sin</b><br>This phrase affirms the sinless nature of Christ, a critical aspect of His qualification to be the perfect sacrifice for sin. The sinlessness of Jesus is attested in various scriptures, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, which states that He "knew no sin," and <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>, which describes Him as being "without sin." This sinlessness is essential for His role as the mediator between God and humanity, as only a sinless being could atone for the sins of others. The absence of sin in Christ also sets Him apart from all other humans, highlighting His divine nature and the fulfillment of the righteous requirements of the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, believed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.
