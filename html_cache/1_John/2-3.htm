In the context of 1 John, the apostle is addressing believers who may be facing doubts about their salvation. Assurance is a recurring theme in John's writings, as seen in <a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>, where the purpose of his Gospel is to instill belief and certainty in Jesus as the Christ. The concept of assurance is also echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>, which speaks of drawing near to God with a full assurance of faith.<p><b>that we have come to know Him:</b><br>Knowing God is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting a deep, personal relationship rather than mere intellectual acknowledgment. In the Old Testament, knowing God often involved covenantal faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, where God promises that all will know Him. In the New Testament, this knowledge is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who reveals the Father (<a href="/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7-9</a>). The Greek word for "know" (ginosko) implies an ongoing, experiential knowledge, suggesting a dynamic relationship with God through Christ.<p><b>if we keep His commandments.</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is a hallmark of genuine faith. This reflects the teachings of Jesus, who stated in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." The commandments refer not only to the moral and ethical teachings of Jesus but also to the broader scope of God's will as revealed in Scripture. This obedience is not legalistic but is a response to the grace and love received from God. The connection between love and obedience is further emphasized in 1 <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a>, where keeping God's commandments is described as an expression of love for God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of this letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing false teachings and needed reassurance of their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of 1 John, as knowing Him and keeping His commandments are key themes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading incorrect doctrines, challenging the true knowledge of God and His commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asia_minor.htm">Asia Minor</a></b><br>The region where the early church communities addressed in this letter were likely located.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is a tangible way to confirm our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_knowledge.htm">The Nature of True Knowledge</a></b><br>Knowing God is not merely intellectual but is demonstrated through a life of obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_love_in_obedience.htm">The Role of Love in Obedience</a></b><br>Our love for God is expressed through our willingness to follow His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_against_false_teachings.htm">Discernment Against False Teachings</a></b><br>True knowledge of God is marked by adherence to His commandments, providing a standard to evaluate teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_obedience.htm">Practical Obedience</a></b><br>Daily life should reflect our commitment to God's commandments, impacting our decisions and interactions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_2_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_3_Knowing_God_via_obedience.htm">How does 1 John 2:3 define knowing God through obedience to His commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Obedience_s_role_in_1_John_with_God.htm">What role does obedience play in our relationship with God according to 1 John?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_His_commandments_daily_2.htm">How can we practically apply "keep His commandments" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_John_2_3_to_John_14_15_teachings.htm">How does 1 John 2:3 connect with Jesus' teachings in John 14:15?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_God_s_commandments_today.htm">What steps can you take to ensure you are keeping God's commandments today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_defines_knowing_God_in_1_John_2_3.htm">How does 1 John 2:3 define knowing God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_3_s_link_obedience_faith.htm">What does 1 John 2:3 imply about obedience and faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_3_vs_grace_without_works.htm">How does 1 John 2:3 challenge the concept of grace without works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_john_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 John 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_auricular_confession.htm">What does having everything for life and godliness mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_you_live_according_to_my_teachings.htm">Do you live according to My teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_of_the_general_epistles.htm">What are the key themes of the General Epistles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_1_john_1_9_more_than_a_coping_tool.htm">1 John 1:9 promises forgiveness through confession.

Scripture never leaves His children guessing about their standing (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>).<p>- &#8220;By this&#8221; points to a concrete standard, not shifting feelings. Just as Jesus said, &#8220;You will recognize them by their fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>), John identifies observable evidence.<p>- The Spirit uses tangible markers so believers can rest in confidence rather than anxiety (<a href="/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That we have come to know Him</b><p>- &#8220;Know&#8221; here is more than facts; it is relational intimacy, the very life Jesus described: &#8220;Now this is eternal life: that they may know You&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>- John writes to people who may have professed faith but are tempted by counterfeit claims. True knowledge of God displays itself, echoing, &#8220;No one who abides in Him keeps on sinning&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;have come to know&#8221; points to a past moment of conversion with ongoing results&#8212;similar to Paul&#8217;s confidence: &#8220;I know whom I have believed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If we keep His commandments</b><p>- Obedience is the litmus test. Jesus said plainly, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>); John simply applies that teaching.<p>- &#8220;Keep&#8221; means watch over, guard, treasure&#8212;an attitude that delights in God&#8217;s will (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>).<p>- This is not salvation by works; rather, works reveal salvation already received (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>- The commandments are not burdensome (<a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>); they are evidence that Christ&#8217;s life is active within.<p>- Ongoing obedience distinguishes genuine disciples from pretenders who merely say &#8220;Lord, Lord&#8221; but do not do what He says (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John offers a simple but searching test: real assurance comes through obedient living. When a believer guards and practices God&#8217;s commands, he can confidently know he belongs to Him.

The knowledge is no mere intellectual apprehension, such as the Gnostic, postulated, but a moral and spiritual affection and activity. It is possible to know and hate (<a href="/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>). Again, the knowledge is not a mere emotional appreciation. Christianity knows nothing of piety without morality.
