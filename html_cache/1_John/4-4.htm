It indicates a close, familial relationship between John and his audience, likely referring to believers who are spiritually young or in need of guidance. This term is consistent with John's style throughout his epistles, emphasizing the intimate and nurturing relationship between spiritual leaders and their congregations. It also echoes Jesus' own use of "little children" in passages like <a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>, highlighting the importance of humility and dependence on God.<p><b>are from God</b><br>This phrase affirms the divine origin and identity of believers. Being "from God" signifies that believers are born of God, as seen in <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, where those who receive Christ are given the right to become children of God. This identity is foundational to the Christian faith, emphasizing that believers are not of the world but belong to God, having been regenerated by the Holy Spirit. This concept is central to understanding the believer's position and authority in spiritual matters.<p><b>and have overcome them</b><br>The "them" refers to false prophets and antichrists mentioned earlier in the chapter. The assurance of having "overcome" them is rooted in the victory believers have through their faith in Christ, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4-5</a>. This victory is not through human strength but through reliance on God's power and truth. The concept of overcoming is a recurring theme in John's writings, particularly in Revelation, where believers are called to overcome the world and its challenges through faithfulness to Christ.<p><b>because greater is He who is in you</b><br>This phrase highlights the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in believers, which is greater than any worldly power or spirit. The Holy Spirit's presence is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, where He assures His disciples that the Spirit of truth will dwell with them and be in them. This indwelling provides believers with the strength, wisdom, and discernment needed to resist false teachings and spiritual deception.<p><b>than he who is in the world</b><br>The "he" refers to Satan or the spirit of the antichrist, representing the forces of evil and deception in the world. This phrase contrasts the power of God within believers with the limited power of the enemy. It reassures believers that, despite the presence of evil in the world, God's power is supreme and will ultimately prevail. This assurance is echoed in passages like <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, where Jesus declares that He has overcome the world, providing hope and confidence to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_children.htm">Little Children</a></b><br>A term of endearment used by John to address believers, indicating their spiritual relationship with God and their need for guidance and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty Creator, who indwells believers through the Holy Spirit, empowering them to overcome worldly challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents the system of values and beliefs that are opposed to God, often influenced by Satan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_antichrist.htm">The Spirit of Antichrist</a></b><br>Refers to false teachings and influences that deny Christ and oppose God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Believers are identified as "from God," signifying their new nature and relationship with Him.

They are on one side, and the apostle's readers on the other, and it is from this standpoint that they are to "prove the spirits." St. John knows nothing of any neutral position from which the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error can be criticized "with absolute impartiality." "He that is not with me is against me." This assumed neutral position is already within the domain of error. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have overcome them.</span> "Them" means the false teachers; but in what sense have St. John's "little children" overcome them? He may be speaking by anticipation; confident of the victory, he writes of it as an accomplished fact (comp. <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). But it is better to take the statement literally. By refusing to listen to the false teachers (<a href="/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8</a>) the sheep have conquered them: the seducers have "gone out" (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>), unable to hold their own within the fold.
