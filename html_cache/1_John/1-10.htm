The claim of sinlessness contradicts the biblical teaching of universal sinfulness (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). The Gnostic heresy, prevalent during the time of John's writing, often denied the reality of sin, emphasizing spiritual knowledge over moral conduct. This denial undermines the need for Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is central to Christian doctrine. The acknowledgment of sin is crucial for genuine repentance and salvation.<p><b>we make Him out to be a liar</b><br>Claiming sinlessness not only deceives oneself but also accuses God of falsehood. God&#8217;s revelation through Scripture consistently affirms human sinfulness (<a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). By denying sin, one contradicts God's testimony about human nature and the necessity of redemption through Christ. This phrase underscores the seriousness of such a claim, as it challenges the integrity and truthfulness of God Himself.<p><b>and His word is not in us</b><br>The absence of God's word indicates a lack of true fellowship with Him. The "word" here refers to the message of the Gospel and the teachings of Scripture, which reveal human sinfulness and the need for a Savior. When God's word dwells within believers, it transforms their understanding and behavior (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). This phrase suggests that those who deny their sinfulness have not truly embraced the Gospel, as genuine acceptance of God's word leads to the acknowledgment of sin and the pursuit of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing false teachings and needed reassurance of their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals in the early church who denied the reality of sin and the need for confession, leading believers astray.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_sin.htm">Acknowledgment of Sin</a></b><br>Recognizing our sin is crucial for a genuine relationship with God.

He is speaking to professing believers, not outsiders, reminding us that everyone stands guilty before God.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently testifies that sin is universal: &#8220;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>); &#8220;There is no one who does good, not even one&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Claiming sinlessness is self-deception (see v. 8) and contradicts passages like <a href="/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>, &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin&#8217;?&#8221;<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s wording exposes any tendency to minimize sin&#8212;whether by redefining it, comparing ourselves with others, or ignoring God&#8217;s standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we make Him out to be a liar</b><p>&#8226; Denying personal sin doesn&#8217;t merely mislead ourselves; it brands God a liar because His Word declares that every human being has fallen.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s character is truth itself: &#8220;It is impossible for God to lie&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>); &#8220;God&#8230;cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). Claiming the opposite of what He has revealed assaults His integrity.<p>&#8226; In effect, it aligns us with the father of lies (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), whereas believers are called to walk in truth (3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>).<p>&#8226; A practical takeaway: owning our sin honors God&#8217;s truthfulness and opens the door for cleansing (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and His word is not in us</b><p>&#8226; Persistent denial of sin shows that God&#8217;s word has not taken root in the heart. Genuine reception of Scripture produces conviction, confession, and repentance (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>; <a href="/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;His word&#8221; here echoes <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.&#8221; If that truth is absent, so is the sanctifying work it brings.<p>&#8226; The phrase parallels John&#8217;s earlier test: those who claim fellowship with God yet walk in darkness &#8220;lie and do not practice the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The evidence of God&#8217;s word dwelling in us includes:<p>&#8211; Sensitivity to sin (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>)<p>&#8211; Ongoing confession (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>)<p>&#8211; Growth in obedience (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s straightforward sentence dismantles any pretense of personal perfection. Denying our sinfulness contradicts God&#8217;s clear testimony, insults His truthfulness, and exposes an empty heart untouched by His Word. The proper response is humble agreement with God, leading to the cleansing and fellowship promised in the surrounding verses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Once more we have no mere repetition, but a fresh thought. "We have not sin" (verse 8) refers to our natural condition; "we have not sinned" (verse 10) refers to definite acts. Note the climax: we lie (verse 6); we lead ourselves utterly astray (verse 8): we make God a liar (verse 10). The whole of God's dealing with man since the Fall, especially in the Incarnation, is based on the fact of man's innate sinfulness. To deny this fact, therefore, is to charge the God of light and truth with acting and maintaining a vast and persistent lie. It is difficult to see how this strong language can be reconciled with the Roman dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary: why does not her "son" (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26, 27</a>) except her from its sweep? His word is not in us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, we are cut off from all communication with him (<a href="/john/5-38.htm">John 5:38</a>; <a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>). "His Word" is the sum total of the Divine revelation. That which in itself is "the truth "(verse 8), when communicated to us is "his Word." How thoroughly the Church of England enters into the spirit of these verses (8-10) is shown by the fact that it appoints confession and absolution as part of public service <span class="accented">every morning and evening throughout the year</span>, as well as of every celebration of the Eucharist. As Bede points out, the Lord's Prayer itself, with the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses," is a conclusive answer to Pelagian opponents of St. John's doctrine. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
