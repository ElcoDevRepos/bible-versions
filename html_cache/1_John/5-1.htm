Belief in Jesus as the Christ is foundational to Christian doctrine, as seen in Peter's confession in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus for salvation, as highlighted in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>.<p><b>has been born of God</b><br>The concept of being "born of God" refers to spiritual rebirth, a theme central to John's writings (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>).

It signifies a new identity and relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. This rebirth is not achieved by human effort but is a divine act of grace, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>and everyone who loves the Father</b><br>Loving the Father is a natural response to being born of God. This love is not merely emotional but involves obedience and reverence, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>. The relationship between love for God and obedience is further emphasized in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>. The Father, in this context, refers to God as the source of life and the one who initiates the believer's spiritual birth.<p><b>also loves those born of Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the inseparable link between love for God and love for fellow believers. The community of faith is characterized by mutual love, as instructed in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>. This love is a reflection of God's love and serves as a testimony to the world. The early church exemplified this love in their communal life, as described in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>.
