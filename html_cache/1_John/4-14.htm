In the context of 1 John, the author is combating false teachings, particularly those denying the incarnation of Christ. The use of "seen" underscores the physical reality of Jesus' life and ministry, aligning with passages like <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh. The term "testify" is legal in nature, suggesting a solemn declaration of truth, akin to the role of witnesses in a court of law. This is consistent with the Jewish tradition of requiring two or three witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>that the Father has sent His Son</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine initiative in the mission of Jesus. The sending of the Son by the Father is a central theme in the Gospel of John (e.g., <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>), emphasizing the pre-existence of Christ and His divine origin. The relationship between the Father and the Son is foundational to understanding the Trinity, where the Father sends the Son, and later, the Holy Spirit is sent to believers. This sending also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child given to us, indicating divine purpose and mission.<p><b>to be the Savior of the world</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the universal scope of Jesus' salvific work. Unlike the limited nationalistic expectations of a Messiah who would deliver Israel from political oppression, Jesus' mission is to save humanity from sin. This is consistent with the prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant is a light to the nations, bringing salvation to the ends of the earth. The term "Savior" connects to the Old Testament concept of God as the deliverer of His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a>) and is fulfilled in Jesus, who offers redemption through His death and resurrection. The phrase "of the world" underscores the inclusivity of the gospel, breaking down barriers between Jew and Gentile, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, who provides a firsthand account of Jesus' life and ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, who sent Jesus into the world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Jesus Christ, who is sent by the Father to be the Savior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents humanity and the creation that Jesus came to save.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_testimony.htm">The Testimony</a></b><br>The witness of the apostles, including John, who have seen and testify to Jesus' mission and divinity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_testimony.htm">The Certainty of Testimony</a></b><br>The apostles' testimony is based on firsthand experience.
