The righteousness of God is a foundational attribute, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>, which states, "For the LORD is righteous, He loves justice." In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is the ultimate revelation of God's righteousness, fulfilling the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). Understanding God's righteousness is crucial for believers, as it sets the standard for Christian conduct and reflects the moral perfection of God.<p><b>you also know that everyone who practices righteousness</b><br>The practice of righteousness is a recurring theme in the Johannine epistles, highlighting the importance of living out one's faith through actions. This phrase suggests a visible, ongoing commitment to righteous living, which is a hallmark of true believers. The concept of practicing righteousness is echoed in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is described as dead. The cultural context of the early church, surrounded by pagan practices, made the call to live righteously a distinctive mark of Christian identity.<p><b>has been born of Him</b><br>Being "born of Him" refers to the spiritual rebirth that occurs when one becomes a follower of Christ, a concept introduced by Jesus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a> during His conversation with Nicodemus. This new birth signifies a transformation and adoption into God's family, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, which speaks of being born again through the living and enduring word of God. The phrase underscores the intimate relationship between God and believers, who are empowered by the Holy Spirit to live righteously. This spiritual rebirth is a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "He" in the verse, the righteous one whose life and teachings are the foundation for Christian living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who are "born of Him," indicating a spiritual rebirth and a life characterized by practicing righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_righteousness.htm">Understanding Righteousness</a></b><br>Righteousness is not just a moral standard but a reflection of God's character.

God&#8217;s nature sets the standard; His righteousness is not an abstract idea but a living reality we encounter in Christ (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).<p>&#8211; When John says &#8220;If you know,&#8221; he assumes believers have come to a settled conviction about who God is&#8212;through Scripture, the Spirit&#8217;s witness, and personal experience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you also know</b><p>&#8211; John moves from doctrine to deduction. Because God is righteous, certain conclusions follow.<p>&#8211; Biblically, true knowledge of God is never merely theoretical; it produces discernment (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>).<p>&#8211; The apostle&#8217;s logic invites believers to connect the dots: what we understand about God must shape how we evaluate people, starting with ourselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that everyone who practices righteousness</b><p>&#8211; John shifts focus to human conduct. &#8220;Practices&#8221; (present tense) pictures an ongoing pattern, not an isolated act.<p>&#8211; Genuine believers are not sinless, yet their habitual direction is toward obedience (<a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-25</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus taught the same principle: &#8220;You will recognize them by their fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Righteous practice includes:<p>&#8226; Obeying God&#8217;s commands (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-6</a>)<p>&#8226; Loving fellow believers (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>)<p>&#8226; Walking in truth and purity (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>)<p>&#8211; Such a lifestyle is evidence, not the cause, of spiritual life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has been born of Him</b><p>&#8211; John anchors righteous living in the miracle of new birth: &#8220;To all who did receive Him&#8230;He gave the right to become children of God&#8230;born of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p>&#8211; Regeneration is God&#8217;s work, imparting a new nature that desires holiness (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase &#8220;born of Him&#8221; underscores family resemblance. Children naturally reflect their Father; likewise, believers reflect God&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8211; This birth is the ultimate explanation for sustained obedience&#8212;grace transforms the root, and therefore the fruit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a> links knowledge, character, and conduct in a seamless chain. Because God is perfectly righteous, anyone truly born of Him will demonstrate a life oriented toward righteousness. The verse offers both assurance and discernment: assurance for believers who see evidence of new life in their actions, and discernment to recognize authentic faith in a world of claims. The newborn heart beats in rhythm with the Father&#8217;s own righteousness, making holiness not merely possible but inevitable for God&#8217;s true children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - This verse forms a bridge between the two main divisions of the Epistle. The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in spite of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and following <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ).
