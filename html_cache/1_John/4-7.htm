It indicates a close, familial relationship among believers, emphasizing the unity and love that should characterize the Christian community. This term is also used by God the Father to describe Jesus at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>), highlighting the divine love that believers are called to emulate.<p><b>Let us love one another</b><br>This command is central to the Christian faith and echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>, where He instructs His disciples to love one another as He has loved them. The call to love is not merely an emotional response but an active, selfless commitment to the well-being of others. In the Greco-Roman world, where social hierarchies were rigid, this command was radical, promoting equality and mutual care among all believers.<p><b>Because love comes from God</b><br>This phrase establishes the divine origin of true love, distinguishing it from human or worldly love. In the biblical context, God's love is agape, characterized by selflessness, sacrifice, and unconditional commitment. This love was most profoundly demonstrated in the sending of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The assertion that love comes from God underscores the belief that God is the ultimate source and example of love, and that human love should reflect His nature.<p><b>Everyone who loves has been born of God</b><br>This statement connects love with spiritual rebirth, a concept introduced by Jesus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>. Being "born of God" implies a transformation that occurs when one accepts Christ, resulting in a new nature that reflects God's character. The ability to love selflessly and sacrificially is evidence of this new birth and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>).<p><b>And knows God</b><br>To "know God" in this context goes beyond intellectual understanding; it involves an intimate, experiential relationship with Him. This knowledge is relational and transformative, leading to a life that mirrors God's love. The connection between knowing God and loving others is emphasized throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a> and <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, where knowing God is linked to living out His love and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, traditionally identified as John the Apostle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples. He is known for his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of this letter, likely a group of early Christians facing challenges such as false teachings and internal divisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source of love, as emphasized in this verse.
