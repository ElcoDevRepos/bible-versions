In the biblical context, love is not merely an emotion but an action demonstrated through sacrifice. The Greek word for love here is "agape," which signifies selfless, unconditional love. This sets the standard for Christian love, contrasting with the world's often self-centered understanding of love.<p><b>Jesus laid down His life for us:</b><br>This refers to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a central event in Christian theology. Historically, Jesus' death occurred around 30-33 AD in Jerusalem, a city with significant religious and political tension. The act of laying down His life is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. It also serves as the ultimate example of sacrificial love, a type of Christ's role as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers:</b><br>This phrase calls believers to emulate Christ's sacrificial love in their relationships with others. The term "brothers" refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the importance of community and mutual support within the body of Christ. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends." It challenges Christians to prioritize others' needs, even to the point of self-sacrifice, reflecting the early church's communal living and support as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose sacrificial death is the ultimate demonstration of love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, facing challenges of false teachings and needing encouragement in love and truth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event where Jesus laid down His life, serving as the ultimate act of love and sacrifice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers.htm">Brothers (and Sisters) in Christ</a></b><br>Fellow believers who are called to emulate Christ's love in their relationships with one another.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_love.htm">Understanding True Love</a></b><br>True love is defined by sacrifice, as demonstrated by Jesus.

Love has been declared the criterion for distinguishing the children of God from the children of the devil. It remains to show what love is; and this is best seen in a concrete example. "The Eternal Word, incarnate and dying for the truth, inspires St. John to guard it with apostolic chivalry; but also this revelation of the heart of God melts him into tenderness towards the race which Jesus has loved so well. To St. John a lack of love for men seems sheer dishonour to the love of Christ" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - In this (verse 10; <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>)we have come to know (have acquired and possess the knowledge of) love (what love is), in that he laid down his life for us. This is better than "We have come to know love as consisting in this, that he laid down his life for us," which would have been <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. Cain is the type of hate; Christ, of love. Cain took his brother's life to benefit himself; Christ laid down his own life to benefit his enemies (see on John 10:12). This realized ideal of love we must imitate; ready to sacrifice ourselves, and even our lives, for the good of others. The effacement of another's rights and perhaps existence for one's own sake is the essence of hatred; the effacement of one's self for another's sake is the essence of love. Christ died for those who hated him; and the Christian must confront the hatred of the world with a love that is ready even to die for the haters. This shows that the "brethren" here and in verse 14, though used primarily of Christians, does not exclude unbelievers; otherwise the parallel with Christ would be spoiled (see on verse 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
