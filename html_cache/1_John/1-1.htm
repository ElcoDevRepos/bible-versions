It underscores the pre-existence of Christ before creation, affirming His divine nature. This echoes <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, establishing a connection between the creation narrative and the revelation of Christ. The "beginning" here is not merely a point in time but signifies the eternal existence and divine origin of Jesus.<p><b>which we have heard</b><br>The apostle John emphasizes the firsthand experience of the apostles with Jesus. This personal testimony is crucial for establishing the credibility of the message. Hearing Jesus' teachings directly, the apostles were witnesses to His authority and truth. This phrase also highlights the oral tradition of passing down teachings before the New Testament was written, emphasizing the importance of apostolic witness in the early church.<p><b>which we have seen with our own eyes</b><br>John stresses the visual confirmation of Jesus' life and ministry. This eyewitness account counters any claims that Jesus was merely a spiritual or mythical figure. The apostles' direct observation of Jesus' miracles, death, and resurrection provides a foundation for their testimony. This aligns with <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>, where Peter asserts they were "eyewitnesses of His majesty."<p><b>which we have gazed upon</b><br>The term "gazed upon" suggests a deeper, more contemplative observation than merely seeing. It implies a careful and intentional examination of Jesus' life and works. This reflects the intimate relationship the apostles had with Jesus, allowing them to understand His divine nature and mission more fully. This contemplative witnessing is akin to the beholding of God's glory, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p><b>and touched with our own hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical reality of Jesus, countering early Gnostic beliefs that denied His humanity. By touching Jesus, the apostles confirmed His incarnation, affirming that He was fully God and fully man. This tangible interaction is reminiscent of Thomas touching Jesus' wounds post-resurrection (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>), reinforcing the truth of the resurrection and the physicality of Jesus' body.<p><b>this is the Word of life</b><br>The "Word of life" refers to Jesus as the living revelation of God, the source of eternal life. This title connects to <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where Jesus is described as the "Word." It signifies that through Jesus, the divine life is made accessible to humanity. The phrase encapsulates the essence of the Gospel message: that in Christ, life&#8212;eternal and abundant&#8212;is found. This aligns with Jesus' declaration in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>Traditionally believed to be the author of 1 John, he was one of Jesus' closest disciples and an eyewitness to His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Word of life," Jesus is central to this passage as the incarnate Word who was from the beginning.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, likely a community of believers facing challenges to their faith, including false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_eternal_nature_of_christ.htm">The Eternal Nature of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is not a created being but has existed from the beginning, affirming His divinity and eternal nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incarnation.htm">The Incarnation</a></b><br>The tangible experiences of hearing, seeing, and touching emphasize the reality of the Incarnation.

There it was calm contemplation of the height and depth of Christ's existence; here he vehemently insists on the personal relation between the Word and those to whom He had been revealed.<p>As in the Gospel, he starts with the grandeur of an indefiniteness beyond which no eye can pierce: At the beginning of all that concerns us, be it world or universe or all creation, there was----that which we are announcing. "That which," not "Him who," because it is not merely the Person of Christ which he is going to declare, but also His Being, all that relates to Him, His gospel, the treasures of wisdom that lay in Him, His truth, all that could be known about Him by human ken.<p>The vibrating eloquence of the passage makes the construction at first sight obscure. But take "that declare we unto you" (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>) as the principal verb, set aside <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1John 1:2</a> as a parenthesis, notice the rising climax of <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a> (heard, seen, looked upon, handled), pause at the end of <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a> to sum up the results of this climax in the words "of (or, <span class= "ital">that which concerns</span>) the Word of life," and at the beginning of <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a> resume the thoughts interrupted by the parenthesis, and all is at once clear. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The first clause states what or how the object is in itself; the next three state St. John's relation to it; "which," in the first clause nominative, in the others is accusative. The neuter (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>) expresses a collective and comprehensive whole (<a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>; <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc.); the attributes of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> himself are indicated. Or, as Jelf expresses it, "the neuter gender denotes immaterial personality, the masculine or feminine material personality." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning</span> is not quite the same as in <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; there St. John tells us that the Word was in existence before the world was created; here that he was in existence before he was manifested. Thus far all is indefinite; the philosopher, about to expound a law of nature, might begin, "That which was from the beginning declare we unto you." What follows is in a climax, making the meaning clearer at each step: seeing is more than hearing, and handling than seeing. The climax is in two pairs, of perfects and of aorists; the aorists giving the past acts, the perfects the permanent results. Together they sum up the apostolic experience of that boundless activity of Christ, of which the world could not contain the full account (<a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beheld</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is more than <span class="cmt_word">have seen</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Seeing might be momentary; beholding implies that steady contemplation, for which the beloved disciple had large and abundantly used opportunities. <span class="cmt_word">In our hands handled</span> we may see a reference to <a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>, where the same verb is used <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; and still more to <a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>, where the demanded test of handling is offered to St. Thomas, provoking the confession of faith to which the whole Gospel leads up, "My Lord and my God!" Had St. John merely said "heard," we might have thought that he meant a doctrine. Had he merely said "heard and seen," we might have understood it of the effects of Christ's doctrine. But "our hands handled" shows clearly that <span class="accented">the attributes of the Word become flesh</span> are what St. John insists on, and probably as a contradiction of Docetism. "Those who read his letter could have no doubt that he was referring to the time when he saw the face of Jesus Christ, when he heard his discourses, when he grasped his hand, when he leaned upon his breast" (Maurice). Between the first clause and what follows lies the tremendous fact of the Incarnation; and St. John piles verb on verb, and clause on clause, to show that he speaks with the authority of full knowledge, and that there is no possible room for Ebionite or Cerinthian error. The first clause assures us that Jesus was no mere man; the others assure us that he was really man. Precisely that Being who was in existence from the beginning is that of whom St. John and others have had, and still possess, knowledge by all the means through which knowledge can have access to the mind of man. (For "seeing with the eyes," cf. <a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>; for <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of contemplating with delight [Stark 16:11, 14], <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 34</a>; <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the Word of life.</span> "Concerning" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> may depend on "have heard," and, by a kind of zengma, on the other three verbs also; or on the main verb," we declare." "The Word of life" means "the Word who is the Life," like "the city of Rome,... the Book of Genesis;" the genitive case is "the characterizing or identifying genitive." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is strongly against the interpretation, "the word of life," i.e., the life-giving gospel. Had St. John meant this, he would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24, 37</a>; <a href="/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a>; <a href="/john/14-24.htm">John 14:24</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is very frequent of persons (<a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8, 15, 22, 30, 48</a>, etc.). Moreover, the evident connexion between the introductions to his Gospel and Epistle compels us to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the same sense in both (see on John 1:1 in this Commentary, and in the 'Cambridge Greek Testament' or 'Bible for Schools'). What St. John has to announce is his own experience of the Eternal Word incarnate, the Eternal Life made manifest (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>); his hearing of his words, his seeing with his own eyes his Messianic works, his contemplation of the Divinity which shone through both; his handling of the body of the risen Redeemer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8011;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
