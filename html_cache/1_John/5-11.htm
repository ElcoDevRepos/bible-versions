In biblical times, a testimony was a solemn declaration of truth, often given in a legal or covenantal context. This phrase emphasizes the divine authority and reliability of the message being conveyed. The concept of testimony is central to the Johannine writings, where the truth about Jesus is consistently affirmed by God, the Spirit, and the apostles (<a href="/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31-39</a>).<p><b>God has given us eternal life:</b><br>Eternal life is a central theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of John. It is not merely an unending existence but a quality of life that begins now and continues forever, characterized by a relationship with God. This life is a gift from God, emphasizing His grace and love. The present tense "has given" indicates that eternal life is a current possession for believers, not just a future promise. This aligns with <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where eternal life is offered through belief in Jesus.<p><b>and this life is in His Son:</b><br>The phrase underscores the exclusivity of Jesus as the source of eternal life. It reflects the core Christian belief that salvation and eternal life are found only through Jesus Christ. This is consistent with Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life. The preposition "in" signifies a deep, abiding union with Christ, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul (e.g., <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). This union is both mystical and real, signifying that life in its fullest sense is found in a relationship with Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The giver of eternal life, central to the Christian faith as the Creator and Sustainer of all things.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (His Son)</a></b><br>The Son of God, through whom eternal life is given.

Here he tells us what God is actually testifying to.<p>&#8226; Testimony means a sworn witness, so God Himself is standing in the court of human hearts declaring what is true.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoed this in <a href="/john/5-32.htm">John 5:32, 37</a> when He said the Father bears witness about Him.<p>&#8226; Because the witness is divine, doubting it is calling God a liar (<a href="/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>). That raises the stakes higher than any human argument ever could.<p>The point: the statement that follows is not opinion or theory; it is the reliable, unchangeable word of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has given us</b><p>Notice the verb tense&#8212;&#8220;has given.&#8221; The gift is already offered, not merely promised for the future.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> reminds us that &#8220;the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> underscores that salvation is &#8220;by grace&#8230; not by works,&#8221; so our effort never earns it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;I give them eternal life, and they will never perish.&#8221; The giving is present, personal, and permanent.<p>Salvation, then, rests on what God has done, not on what we might do. Our role is to receive what He freely gives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eternal life</b><p>Eternal life is more than endless existence; it is shared life with God Himself.<p>&#8226; Jesus defined it: &#8220;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> ties eternal life to believing in the Son.<p>&#8226; Paul celebrated that &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8230; displayed His patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>).<p>So eternal life is both qualitative (knowing God now) and quantitative (lasting forever). It begins the moment someone believes and stretches unbroken into eternity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And this life is in His Son</b><p>The gift is located &#8220;in His Son.&#8221; Outside of Christ, there is no eternal life.<p>&#8226; Verse 12 drives it home: &#8220;Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;I am the way&#8230; No one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> affirms, &#8220;There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.&#8221;<p>Practical take-aways:<p>- Possessing Christ equals possessing life; rejecting Christ equals forfeiting life.<p>- Assurance flows from relationship, not from religious performance.<p>- Evangelism is urgent because eternal life is found nowhere else.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God Himself testifies that He has already granted eternal life, and that life comes exclusively through His Son. Because the witness is divine, the gift is certain. Because the life is eternal, the blessing is immeasurable. And because the life is found only in Jesus, trusting Him is mankind&#8217;s single greatest need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - "And the substance of the internal testimony is this - we are conscious of the Divine gift of eternal life, and this we have in the Son of God." St. John's <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not "everlasting life:" the idea of endlessness may be included in it, but it is not the main one. The distinction between eternity and time is one which the human mind feels to be real and necessary. But we are apt to lose ourselves when we try to think of eternity. We admit that it is not time, that it is the very antithesis of time, and yet we attempt to measure it while we declare it to be immeasurable. We make it simply a very long time. The main idea of "eternal life" in St. John's writings has no direct reference to time. Eternal life is possessed already by believers; it is not a thing of the future (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/6-47.htm">John 6:47, 54</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It is that life in God which includes all blessedness, and which is not broken by physical death (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). Its opposite is exclusion from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(haut&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
