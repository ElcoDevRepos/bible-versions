The "hope" refers to the confident expectation of eternal life and the return of Jesus Christ. This hope is rooted in the promises of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, which speaks of the "blessed hope" of Christ's appearing. The phrase "in Him" underscores the centrality of Jesus Christ in the believer's life, as He is the source and object of this hope. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that places Jesus at the center of God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life.<p><b>purifies himself</b><br>The act of purification is a response to the hope believers have in Christ. This purification is both a moral and spiritual process, reflecting the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which urges believers to be holy as God is holy. The concept of purification has roots in the Old Testament, where ceremonial cleanliness was required for worship (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>). In the New Testament, this purification is internal and spiritual, achieved through the work of the Holy Spirit and the believer's cooperation in sanctification. It involves a conscious effort to turn away from sin and live a life that honors God, as seen in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, which calls believers to cleanse their hands and purify their hearts.<p><b>just as Christ is pure</b><br>Christ's purity is the standard for believers. This purity is not merely ceremonial but intrinsic to His nature as the sinless Son of God. <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> highlights that Jesus was tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin. His purity is both a model and a means for believers; through His sacrifice, believers are made righteous (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The call to be pure as Christ is pure is a call to reflect His character in our lives, striving to embody His love, holiness, and righteousness. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which not only forgives sin but also empowers believers to live in a manner worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose purity and righteousness are the standard for believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the epistle, who are encouraged to live in purity and hope in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_hope_in_christ.htm">The Nature of Hope in Christ</a></b><br>The hope referred to in 1 <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> is not a wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on the promises of God. This hope motivates believers to live in a way that reflects their future transformation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_purity.htm">The Call to Purity</a></b><br>The Greek word for "purifies" (hagnizei) implies a continuous action.

Commentators differ as to whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to the Father or Christ, and so also with regard to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The best way is to take <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as God, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as Christ: this agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in verse 2, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 5, and with the common use of the two pronouns. It is doubtless possible, especially in St. John, to take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as merely recalling the person already indicated by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or otherwise, and make both pronouns here refer to God. At first sight this seems to make a better sequence between verses 2 and 3: hereafter we shall be like God; therefore here we must strive to become pure as he is. Moreover, it is of the Father that it is written, "Be ye holy; for I am holy" (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>); and again, "Ye shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (<a href="/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). But the other is simpler grammatically, and preserves the logical sequence equally well. Hereafter we shall be like God. Every one who has such a hope as this will aim at becoming like God here; <span class="accented">even as Jesus Christ has set us an example</span>, a perfect realization of human conformity to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
