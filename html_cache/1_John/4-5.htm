In biblical context, "the world" often refers to human society organized in opposition to God (see <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>). This distinction between the world and the followers of Christ is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the spiritual battle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of this world. Historically, the early church faced persecution and pressure to conform to societal norms, which were often contrary to Christian teachings.<p><b>That is why they speak from the world&#8217;s perspective,</b><br>Here, the text highlights the source of their speech and teachings. Speaking from the world&#8217;s perspective means their messages are influenced by secular values, which can be contrary to biblical truth. This aligns with the warning in <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a> about being taken captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy. The cultural context of the time included various philosophies and religious beliefs that competed with Christian doctrine, and this remains relevant today as believers discern truth amidst diverse worldviews.<p><b>and the world listens to them.</b><br>This indicates that those who are of the world find resonance with worldly messages. The world&#8217;s acceptance of these teachings is contrasted with the rejection often faced by those who speak God&#8217;s truth (see <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the narrow path versus the wide path (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). The acceptance of worldly messages can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy regarding the end times, where people will gather teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>In this context, "the world" refers to the secular, fallen system that is opposed to God and His truth.
