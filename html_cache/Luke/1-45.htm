In the context of <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a>, this blessing is pronounced by Elizabeth upon Mary. The concept of being "blessed" is frequently seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus describes the blessedness of those who exhibit certain spiritual qualities. The use of "she" specifically refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, emphasizing her unique role in salvation history.<p><b>who has believed</b><br>Mary's belief is a central theme in this passage. Her faith is contrasted with Zechariah's initial doubt earlier in <a href="/luke/1-18.htm">Luke 1:18-20</a>, where he questioned the angel's message and was rendered mute as a result. Mary's belief is an example of the faith that is commended throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which lists the heroes of faith. Her trust in God's promise is a model for all believers, illustrating the importance of faith in receiving God's promises.<p><b>that the Lord&#8217;s word to her</b><br>The "Lord's word" refers to the message delivered by the angel Gabriel in <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>, announcing that Mary would conceive and bear a son, Jesus, who would be called the Son of the Most High. This message is rooted in Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which foretells the virgin birth. The phrase underscores the divine origin of the message, affirming that it is not merely human words but a divine promise.<p><b>will be fulfilled.&#8221;</b><br>The fulfillment of God's word is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing God's faithfulness and sovereignty. In the context of Luke, the fulfillment of the promise to Mary is part of the larger narrative of God's redemptive plan, which includes the fulfillment of numerous Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. This assurance of fulfillment is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which declares that God's word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires. The certainty of fulfillment also points to the reliability of God's promises, encouraging believers to trust in His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>- The mother of Jesus, who is visiting her relative Elizabeth.

Throughout Scripture, &#8220;blessed&#8221; marks those who experience the good hand of God&#8212;<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> speaks of the one who &#8220;does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,&#8221; and Jesus affirms, &#8220;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The blessing here is not merely a pleasant feeling; it is the settled approval of God that rests on a life aligned with His purposes.<p>&#8226; Because God&#8217;s blessing is tied to His unchanging character, we can be confident that He still delights to bless those who respond to Him in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is she</b><p>&#8226; Elizabeth directs the blessing to Mary personally. God&#8217;s favor is not an abstract idea; it lands on real people in real situations.<p>&#8226; Earlier Mary had confessed, &#8220;He has looked with favor on the humble state of His servant&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>). The same divine attention that reached Mary reaches every believer who yields to His plan.<p>&#8226; Personal pronouns matter. They remind us that God knows our names, circumstances, and even our doubts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has believed</b><p>&#8226; Faith is the hinge of the whole statement. &#8220;Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), and the same principle surfaces here.<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s belief came without physical proof, echoing Jesus&#8217; later words: &#8220;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God.&#8221; Mary demonstrates the kind of trust that delights Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the Lord&#8217;s word</b><p>&#8226; The object of faith is critical. Mary trusts not in vague optimism but in &#8220;the Lord&#8217;s word.&#8221; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> assures us, &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie,&#8221; while <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> promises His word &#8220;will not return&#8230;empty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The angel had declared, &#8220;For nothing will be impossible with God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>). Mary&#8217;s confidence rests squarely on that divine guarantee.<p>&#8226; Every promise God has spoken carries the weight of His character; therefore, it is utterly reliable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to her</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word came specifically &#8220;to her.&#8221; <a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a> records Mary&#8217;s surrender: &#8220;May it happen to me according to your word.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The personal nature of God&#8217;s promises is seen again in <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;For I know the plans I have for you,&#8221; and in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;all the promises of God are &#8216;Yes&#8217; in Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; While this verse highlights Mary, it also illustrates how God tailors His purposes to each life, inviting us to trust Him for our own callings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be fulfilled</b><p>&#8226; Fulfillment is certain. Unlike Zachariah, who doubted and was told, &#8220;you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>), Mary&#8217;s faith positions her to see the promise realized.<p>&#8226; Jesus later assures, &#8220;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-33.htm">Luke 21:33</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> celebrates Abraham as &#8220;fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised.&#8221; Mary stands in that same stream of assurance&#8212;what God promises, He completes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45</a> celebrates Mary as an example of wholehearted trust. She receives God&#8217;s blessing because she personally believed the Lord&#8217;s promise, anchored her faith in His unbreakable word, and waited expectantly for its fulfillment. The verse invites every believer to embrace the same attitude: take God at His word, personalize His promises, and rest in the certainty that what He has spoken He will surely accomplish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Blessed is she that believed.</span>--The two renderings, "for there shall be," and "that there shall be," are equally tenable grammatically.
