It emphasizes the certainty and importance of what follows. In the context of <a href="/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>, Jesus is speaking to a group that includes Pharisees and other religious leaders, highlighting His role as a teacher and prophet. This introduction underscores the seriousness of the message, akin to the Old Testament prophets who often prefaced their declarations with "Thus says the Lord."<p><b>not one of those men who were invited</b><br>The "men who were invited" refers to the initial guests in the parable of the Great Banquet, representing the Jewish people, particularly the religious leaders who were first to receive God's invitation through the covenants and the Law. Historically, the Jewish nation was chosen by God to be His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>. However, many rejected Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected.<p><b>will taste my banquet.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The "banquet" symbolizes the Kingdom of God and the blessings of salvation. In Jewish culture, banquets were significant social events, often representing joy, fellowship, and abundance. The refusal of the invited guests to partake in the banquet reflects the rejection of Jesus and the salvation He offers. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to feasts, such as the Marriage Supper of the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, which represents the ultimate union of Christ and His Church. The exclusion of the original invitees serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's invitation, emphasizing the theme of divine judgment and the opening of the Kingdom to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this account to teach about the Kingdom of God and the consequences of rejecting His invitation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_host.htm">The Host</a></b><br>Represents God, who has prepared a great banquet and extended invitations to many.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invited_guests.htm">The Invited Guests</a></b><br>Symbolize the people of Israel, particularly the religious leaders and those who initially received God's covenant but rejected Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of God and the eternal fellowship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents the prophets and messengers of God, including Jesus Himself, who extend God's invitation to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_acceptance.htm">The Urgency of Acceptance</a></b><br>The invitation to God's kingdom is extended to all, but it requires a timely and sincere response.

The verse urges immediate, humble acceptance of the Savior&#8217;s invitation, lest the door close and the feast be enjoyed by others while the invited are left outside.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">None of those men which were bidden . . .</span>--Here again we may not press a literal interpretation of the parable. The absolute exclusion of the whole company of the first-invited guests has its anti-type in the general rejection of Israel from fellowship with the Church of Christ. It lies in the very nature of a parable that it deals roughly with general facts, and so it passes over in this instance what would have answered to the admission of a chosen few, "the remnant according to the election of grace" (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm" title="Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.">Romans 11:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper</span>. Whose words are these? Are they spoken by the host of the parable-story; and if so, to whom does he address them? For in the original Greek it is not "I say unto <span class="accented">thee"</span> (singular), the servant with whom throughout he has been holding a colloquy, but "I say unto you" (plural), Who does he mean by "you"? The assembled guests? or especially the already introduced poor of ver. 21 (so Bengel)? But what conceivable purpose, as Stier well asks, would be served by addressing these stern words to the guests admitted? Would <span class="accented">their</span> bliss be increased by a side-glance at those who had lost what they were to enjoy? How inharmonious a close would this be of a parable constructed with such tender graciousness throughout l It is better, therefore, to understand it as spoken with deep solemnity by the Master himself to the assembled guests in the Pharisee's house, with whom he was then sitting at meat, and for whose special instruction he had spoken the foregoing parable of the great supper. "I say unto you, that none of <span class="accented">those</span> who were bidden in the parable-story (and ye know full well that you yourselves are included in that number) shall sit at my table in heaven." This identification of himself as the Host of the great heavenly banquet was quite in accordance with the lofty and unveiled claims of the Master during the last period of his public ministry. Throughout this exposition of the great supper parable, the idea of the primary reference to the Jewish people has been steadily kept in view. It was a distinct piece of teaching, historic and prophetic, addressed to the Jew of the days of our Lord. As years passed on, it became a saying of the deepest interest to the Gentile missionaries and to the rapidly growing Gentile congregations of the first Christian centuries. In time it ceased to be used as a piece of warning history and of instructive prophecy, and the Church in every succeeding age has recognized its deep practical wisdom, and is ever discovering in it fresh lessons which belong to the life of the day, and which seemingly were drawn from it and intended for its special instruction, for its warning and for its comfort. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
