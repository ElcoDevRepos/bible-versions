That the source was Hebrew (Aramaic) is clear from the wording of the narration. Some brief Hebrew (Aramaic) memoir was given to St. Luke, whence he derived his information of this most interesting and instructive incident of the last journey of the Master. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among</span> <span class="cmt_word">the publicans, and he was rich.</span> Jericho, under the Herods, had become again an important centre of trade. It lay on the road from Person to Judaea and Egypt, and had, of course, an important custom-house. The Balm which came especially from the Gilead district was sent through there into all parts of the world. Zacchaeus was at the head of this customs department at Jericho. The exact position of such an official in those days is not known. He probably farmed the customs revenue under some great Roman capitalist of the equestrian order. In such an appointment it was easy to commit even involuntary injustices. The temptations to such an official to enrich himself at the expense of others, besides, were sadly numerous. <span class="accented">Named Zacchaeus. Zakkai</span> signifies "pure" (see <a href="/ezra/2-9.htm">Ezra 2:9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-14.htm">Nehemiah 7:14</a>). It is curious that we find in the Talmud a man named Zakkai, the father of the famous rabbi Jochauan, living at Jericho. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus entered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eiselth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
