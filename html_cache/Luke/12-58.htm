In the cultural context of first-century Judea, disputes were often settled outside of court to avoid lengthy and costly legal proceedings. The biblical principle of reconciliation is echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, where Jesus instructs believers to be reconciled with others before offering gifts at the altar. This reflects the broader biblical theme of peace and unity among believers, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, which encourages living at peace with everyone.<p><b>while you are on your way to the magistrate</b><br>The journey to the magistrate symbolizes the limited time available to resolve conflicts before facing judgment. In ancient times, a magistrate was a local official responsible for administering justice. This imagery serves as a metaphor for the urgency of resolving spiritual and relational disputes before facing divine judgment. The concept of a journey also alludes to the Christian life as a pilgrimage, where believers are called to live righteously and seek reconciliation before the final judgment, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p><b>Otherwise, he may drag you off to the judge</b><br>This phrase highlights the consequences of failing to reconcile. The imagery of being dragged to the judge underscores the loss of control and the inevitability of judgment. In the historical context, Roman legal proceedings were often harsh and unforgiving. This serves as a warning of the spiritual consequences of unresolved sin and conflict, drawing parallels to the final judgment before God, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<p><b>and the judge may hand you over to the officer</b><br>The judge represents authority and the power to enforce justice. In Roman times, the officer, or "bailiff," was responsible for carrying out the judge's orders. This reflects the biblical theme of accountability and the certainty of divine justice. The handing over to the officer symbolizes the transition from judgment to punishment, reminiscent of the separation of the righteous and the wicked in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<p><b>and the officer may throw you into prison</b><br>Prison in the ancient world was a place of confinement and punishment, often used for debtors and criminals awaiting trial or execution. This imagery serves as a stark warning of the consequences of unresolved sin and the urgency of repentance. Theologically, it points to the spiritual bondage of sin and the ultimate separation from God for those who do not seek reconciliation through Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>. The call to reconcile is a call to embrace the freedom and forgiveness offered through Jesus, who is the ultimate reconciler between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversary.htm">Adversary</a></b><br>Represents someone with whom you have a conflict or dispute.

It is a call to take proactive steps in mending relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_implications.htm">Spiritual Implications</a></b><br>Beyond the literal interpretation, this passage can be seen as a metaphor for our relationship with God.

There is, indeed, something at first strangely abrupt in this reproduction of what had appeared in the Sermon on the Mount as part of our Lord's teaching as to the true meaning of the command "Thou shalt not kill." (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a>.) There the words are spoken at once of earthly adversaries and magistrates and of the great Judge of all. Is it so in this place also? Is this the "just judgment" to which <a href="/luke/12-57.htm" title="Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you not what is right?">Luke 12:57</a> referred, in contrast with the prevailing bitterness and hardness of men in the quarrels brought on chiefly by their greed of gain? The answer to the question is found in accepting, as before, both the literal meaning and that of which it becomes a parable, with, perhaps, a greater stress than before on the spiritual aspect of the words. Our Lord is speaking to the people; there has been no immediate reference, as before, to the Sixth Commandment. His teaching has taken a wider range, and the old words, as it were, come back, with every point of the parable brought into full clearness. The "adversary" is the Law that accuses them (<a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>); the judge is none other than the Judge of all the earth; and then all follows in due order as before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 58, 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite</span>. And then the Master passed into one of those parable illustrations with which his hearers were now familiar, and which in a homely way taught the crowd the same grave truth which he had been dwelling upon - the impending terrible judgment which was coming on the people. The lesson, "be reconciled to God while it is yet time," is, of course, <span class="accented">applicable</span> to all lives, precarious and hanging seemingly on a thread as they all are, but it was especially spoken to that generation in view of the awful ruin which he knew was so soon to fall on every Jewish home. The genera] meaning of the parable illustration was obvious; no hearer could fail to understand the Lord's meaning. It is <span class="accented">before</span> arriving at the judgment-seat that you must be reconciled, with the one who accuses you, otherwise it will be too late, and nothing would remain for the guilty accused but the eternal prison-house. At <span class="accented">that</span> moment, when the Master was speaking, individual or nation might have turned to the Lord and lived. There was no time, however, for hesitation. The sands in the hour-glass, which marked the duration of God's longsuffering with Israel, were just running out. Theologians in different ages and of varied schools have made much of the concluding sentence (ver. 59). Roman Catholic divines see in it a strong argument in favor of the doctrine of purgatory, arguing that after death condemnation would be followed by liberation, when a certain payment had been made by the guilty soul; strange ways of paying this debt by means of others we know have been devised by the school of divines who teach this doctrine of purgatory. But the Lord's words here are terribly plain, and utterly exclude any payment of the debt of the soul <span class="accented">by others.</span> The Master emphatically says, "till <span class="accented">thou</span> hast paid the very last mite." The advocate who pleads for universal redemption, and shrinks from a punishment to the duration of which he can see no term, thinks that in the words, "till thou hast paid," he can discern the germ at least of eternal hope. But the impenetrable veil which hangs between us and the endless hereafter prevents us, surely, from even suggesting that any suffering which the soul may endure in the unseen world will ever pay "the <span class="accented">very last mite</span>," and so lead to pardon and peace. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-58.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Make</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(dos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
