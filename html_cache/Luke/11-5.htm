This method was effective in engaging His audience and making complex ideas more relatable.<p><b>&#8220;Suppose one of you goes to his friend</b><br>The scenario begins with a hypothetical situation, a common teaching technique in Jewish rabbinical tradition. The use of "friend" emphasizes the relational aspect of the parable, highlighting themes of community and mutual support, which were central to Jewish society.<p><b>at midnight</b><br>Midnight signifies an inconvenient time, underscoring the urgency and desperation of the request. In ancient times, travel was often avoided at night due to safety concerns, making this request even more unusual and pressing.<p><b>and says, &#8216;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</b><br>Bread was a staple in the diet of the time, symbolizing sustenance and hospitality. The request for "three loaves" suggests a need to provide for a guest, reflecting the cultural importance of hospitality in Jewish tradition.

The midnight visit stresses urgency; the friendship highlights access; the request for simple bread underlines daily dependence. Taken literally and at face value, the verse sets the stage for Jesus to show that, far from being an irritated neighbor, the heavenly Father is eager to meet the needs of His children&#8212;no matter how late the hour or how small the request.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Which of you shall have a friend</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?--</span>The illustration, we can hardly call it a parable, is peculiar to St. Luke, and, as setting forth the power of prayer, is specially characteristic of him. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) The familiar tone, as of one appealing to each man's natural good-will, and the dramatic vividness of the dialogue, make it almost unique in our Lord's teaching. "Midnight" is chosen as being the time at which, above all others, men expect to be left to their repose. The unexpected visitor asks for "three loaves," one for himself, one for the guest, one as a reserve; and he so far trusts his friend as to hope that he will recognise the claims of his friendship for another. So, the implied lesson is, should the man who prays think that God will care for those for whom he pleads, and will give them also their "daily bread" in both the higher and the lower senses of the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Prayer continued. The wisdom of perseverance in prayer is pressed. The Lord introduces his argument by the short parable of the selfish neighbor.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend,</span> <span class="cmt_word">lend me three loaves.</span> This whole passage follows naturally the Lord's own formula of prayer. The teaching contained in vers. 1-13 may be well summarized as the Master's <span class="accented">lesson on prayer.</span> The disciples, when they heard Jesus pray, asked him to instruct them in the holy art. The Lord then suggested to them a series of short <span class="accented">subjects</span> for constant prayer, and further gave them <span class="accented">words</span> in which they could embody these subjects, and then proceeded to press upon them that this constant seeking help from God should never be interrupted; no discouragements were ever to prevent their praying. "See," said the Master, "this" (telling them the little parable) "is what God appears to be when prayer receives no answer." Of course, he is not what he appears to be (see ver. 9). The truth concerning <span class="accented">God</span> does not really come out before the words of ver. 9; but the parable, grotesque and quaint, and picturing a common scene of everyday life, arrested the attention <span class="accented">then</span> as it has done in many a million cases since, and told men out of heart and despairing of receiving any answer to their prayers, to think. Well, here is a case in point; but is God like this? The Lord replies shortly to this mute heart-query. <span class="accented">At midnight.</span> The whole picture is drawn from a poor man's house - children and parents sleeping in one room. "With me in bed" probably suggests what is common in an Eastern house, where a divan or raised platform (rendered here "bed") often filled well-nigh half the room. The hour <span class="accented">midnight</span> has nothing strained in it - it was frequently the practice in the East to travel by night, and so to escape the great heat of the day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
