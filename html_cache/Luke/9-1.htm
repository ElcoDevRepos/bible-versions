The number twelve is symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, suggesting a new spiritual Israel being formed. This gathering signifies a transition from Jesus' solo ministry to a shared mission with His disciples. The calling together emphasizes unity and preparation for the task ahead.<p><b>and gave them power and authority</b><br>Jesus imparts both power and authority to the Twelve, indicating a transfer of His divine ability and the right to exercise it. This empowerment is crucial for their mission, as it reflects Jesus' own ministry of teaching, healing, and casting out demons. The dual gift of power and authority underscores the completeness of their commission, equipping them to act in Jesus' name.<p><b>over all demons</b><br>The authority over demons highlights the spiritual warfare aspect of their mission. In the first-century Jewish context, demonic possession was a recognized reality, and exorcism was a sign of divine authority. This empowerment demonstrates Jesus' dominion over evil and His intention to extend this victory through His disciples. It also fulfills prophecies of the Messiah's power over evil forces, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<p><b>and power to cure diseases</b><br>The ability to cure diseases aligns with Jesus' own healing ministry, which was a testament to His compassion and divine authority. Healing was a sign of the Kingdom of God breaking into the world, restoring creation to its intended wholeness. This power to heal also served as a validation of the apostles' message, confirming their connection to Jesus and His divine mission. The healing acts foreshadow the ultimate restoration promised in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who imparts authority to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve.htm">The Twelve</a></b><br>Refers to the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus, representing the foundation of the early Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual beings opposed to God, often causing harm or possession in individuals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/diseases.htm">Diseases</a></b><br>Physical ailments and illnesses that Jesus empowered His disciples to heal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>Jesus grants His authority to His followers, demonstrating that true power comes from God.

The Galilee ministry was just over; <span class="accented">outwardly</span> it had been a triumphant success; vast crowds had been gathered together. The Master was generally welcomed with a positive enthusiasm; the people heard him gladly. Here and there were visible, as in the cases of the woman who touched him and the synagogue ruler who prayed him to heal his little daughter, just related (ch. 8.), conspicuous examples of a strange or mighty faith; but the success, the Master knew too well, was only on the surface. The crowds who to-day shouted "Hosanna!" and greeted his appearance among them with joy, on the morrow would fall away from him, and on the day following would reappear with the shout "Crucify him!" It was especially to warn his Church in coming ages of this sure result of all earnest devoted preaching and teaching, that he spoke that saddest of parables, "the sower" (ch. 8.) But before he finally brought this Galilaean ministry to a close, he would gather in some few wavering souls, whose hearts he knew were trembling in the balance between the choice of life and good, and death and evil. To help these he sent out this last mission. The word rendered called together" indicates a solemn gathering. <span class="cmt_word">And gave them power</span>, etc. This and the further detail of the next verse (2) roughly describe the work he intended them to do, and the means bestowed on them for its accomplishment.
