The act of seizing Jesus was carried out by a group that included Roman soldiers and temple guards, indicating the collaboration between Jewish and Roman authorities. This moment fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being led like a lamb to the slaughter.<p><b>led Him away</b><br>Jesus is taken from the Garden of Gethsemane, where He had been praying, to face the authorities. This movement signifies the transition from His ministry of teaching and healing to His role as the sacrificial Lamb. The act of being led away also fulfills the imagery of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who is oppressed and afflicted.<p><b>and took Him into the house of the high priest</b><br>The high priest at the time was Caiaphas, and his house served as the setting for the initial phase of Jesus' trial. This location is significant because it represents the religious authority of the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. Archaeological findings suggest that the high priest's house was a large, affluent residence, indicating the power and influence of the religious elite. This setting underscores the irony of the religious leaders' rejection of the true High Priest, Jesus Christ.<p><b>And Peter followed at a distance</b><br>Peter's following at a distance highlights his internal conflict and fear. Despite his earlier bold declarations of loyalty, Peter's actions reveal his struggle with fear and self-preservation. This moment sets the stage for Peter's impending denial of Jesus, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>.

There is, however, no real difficulty if the following historical details be borne in mind. The actual high priest at this juncture was Caiaphas, son-in-law to Annas, who was the legal high priest, but had been deposed by the Roman power some time before. Annas, however, although prevented by the Roman government from bearing the high priestly insignia, was apparently looked upon by the people as the rightful possessor of the dignity, and evidently exercised the chief authority in the Jewish councils. It seems that he and his son-in-law Caiaphas, the Roman nominee, occupied together the high priest's palace. There were three trials of our Lord by the Jews: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Before Annas (<a href="/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12-18</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Before Caiaphas and what has been termed a committee of the Sanhedrm (<a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-68</a>; <a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-65</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Formally before the whole Sanhedrin at dawn (<a href="/luke/22-66.htm">Luke 22:66-71</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="/mark/15-1.htm">Mark 15:1</a>).
