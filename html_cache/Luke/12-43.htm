It implies divine favor and approval. The "servant" here refers to a believer or follower of Christ, emphasizing the role of stewardship and responsibility. In the cultural context of the time, servants were expected to be loyal and diligent, reflecting the relationship between believers and God.<p><b>whose master finds him</b><br>The "master" symbolizes Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as a master or lord in parables. This phrase underscores the expectation of accountability and readiness. The imagery of a master-servant relationship was common in the ancient Near East, where servants were entrusted with significant responsibilities in their master's absence.<p><b>doing so</b><br>This refers to the servant actively fulfilling his duties and responsibilities. It highlights the importance of faithfulness and obedience in the Christian life. The phrase suggests ongoing action, indicating that believers should consistently live out their faith. This aligns with other scriptural teachings on perseverance and diligence, such as in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>.<p><b>when he returns</b><br>The return of the master is a reference to the Second Coming of Christ, a central theme in Christian eschatology. This phrase serves as a reminder of the imminent and unexpected nature of Christ's return, urging believers to remain vigilant and prepared. The concept of a returning master was a familiar motif in Jewish and early Christian teachings, emphasizing the need for readiness and watchfulness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents believers or followers of Christ who are entrusted with responsibilities in the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes Jesus Christ, who will return at an unexpected time to evaluate the faithfulness of His servants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>Refers to the Second Coming of Christ, a future event when Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_household.htm">The Household</a></b><br>Implies the community of believers or the Church, where the servant is expected to fulfill his duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing.htm">The Blessing</a></b><br>The reward or commendation given to the faithful servant, highlighting the joy and approval from the Master.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>Believers are called to be faithful in their responsibilities, knowing that their work is ultimately for the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_for_christ's_return.htm">Readiness for Christ's Return</a></b><br>The unexpected timing of Jesus' return should motivate believers to live in a state of constant readiness and spiritual alertness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reward_of_obedience.htm">The Reward of Obedience</a></b><br>God promises blessings and rewards for those who are found faithful and obedient at His return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_god's_gifts.htm">Stewardship of God's Gifts</a></b><br>Each believer has been entrusted with gifts and responsibilities, and they are accountable for how they manage them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Keeping an eternal perspective helps believers prioritize their lives according to God's will and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_12_43_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 12:43?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_be_blessed_servants_daily.htm">How can we be "blessed" servants according to Luke 12:43 in daily life?
