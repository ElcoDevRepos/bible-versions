The context is important as it follows the parable of the lost son, suggesting a continued theme of stewardship and responsibility. Jesus often used parables to convey deeper spiritual truths, and His audience here is primarily those who are committed to learning from Him.<p><b>There was a rich man</b><br>The mention of a "rich man" sets the stage for a parable that deals with wealth and stewardship. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, but it also came with responsibilities. The rich man in this parable represents those who have been entrusted with resources and must manage them wisely. This character can be seen as a type of God, who entrusts His creation to humanity.<p><b>whose manager was accused</b><br>The manager, or steward, is a key figure in this parable. In ancient times, a steward was responsible for managing the household or business affairs of their master. The accusation against the manager suggests a breach of trust, which is a serious offense. This reflects the biblical theme of accountability, where individuals are held responsible for their actions, especially in positions of trust.<p><b>of wasting his possessions</b><br>The charge of wasting possessions highlights the theme of stewardship and the proper use of resources. In biblical terms, wastefulness is often associated with sin and poor judgment. This phrase connects to other scriptures that emphasize the importance of using one's gifts and resources wisely, such as the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). It also serves as a warning against complacency and negligence in spiritual and material matters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples through parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught important spiritual lessons through His parables.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich_man.htm">Rich Man</a></b><br>A character in the parable representing someone with significant wealth and resources.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/manager.htm">Manager (Steward)</a></b><br>The steward of the rich man's estate, accused of mismanaging or wasting the rich man's possessions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/accusation_of_waste.htm">Accusation of Waste</a></b><br>The event that sets the stage for the parable, highlighting issues of stewardship and accountability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_accountability.htm">Stewardship and Accountability</a></b><br>As believers, we are stewards of the resources God has entrusted to us.

The verse sets the stage for lessons on wise, eternity-minded use of money and opportunities for the glory of the true Owner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XVI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">There was a certain rich man, which had a steward.</span>--There is, perhaps, no single parable that has been subjected to such various and discordant interpretations as this of the Unjust Steward. It seems best to give step by step what seems to be a true exposition of its meaning, and to reserve a survey of other expositions till they can be compared with this.<p>The word "steward" had, we must remember, been already used by our Lord in <a href="/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a>, and had there pointed, beyond the shadow of a doubt, to the office of the Apostles and other ministers, as dispensers of divine truths, and perhaps also, of the means of grace. So St. Paul, whose language is, as we have seen in so many instances, always important in connection with St. Luke's vocabulary, speaks of himself and his fellow-labourers as "<span class= "ital">stewards</span> of the mysteries of God." He has learnt, may we not say, from the parable, that "it is required in <span class= "ital">stewards</span> that a man be found faithful" (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1Corinthians 4:1-2</a>). We start, then, with this clue. The Unjust Steward represents primarily the Pharisees and scribes in their teaching and ministerial functions. But though spoken in the hearing of the Pharisees, the parable was addressed, not to them, but "to the disciples." And the reason of this is obvious. They, too, were called to be "stewards;" they, too, collectively and individually, would have to give an account of their stewardship. But if this is what the steward represents, then the rich man, like the "house-holder" in other parables, can be none else than God, who both appoints the stewards and calls them to account. In the further extension of the parable it is, of course, applicable to all who have any "goods" entrusted to them, any gifts and opportunities, any vocation and ministry in the great kingdom of God.<p><span class= "bld">The same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span>--(1) The Greek word for "was accused" commonly carries with it the idea of false, calumnious accusation. Probably, however, the idea connected with it, as seen in the word <span class= "ital">diabolos,</span> or <span class= "ital">devil,</span> which is derived from it, is that of malignant accusation, whether the charge were true or false. It is conceivable that it may have been purposely chosen to suggest the thought that the great Adversary was at once tempting the double-minded teachers to their life of hypocrisy, and exulting at their fall. If we ask why this was only suggested and not more directly expressed, as it would have been if some one accuser had been named, the answer is found in the fact that the one great Accuser has many mouth-pieces, <span class= "ital">diaboli</span> acting under the <span class= "ital">diabolos</span> (the Greek word stands for "false accusers" in <a href="/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>), and that there was no lack of such comments, more or less malevolent, on the inconsistencies of the professedly religious class. (2) There is an obvious purpose in using the same word, in the hearing of the same persons, as that which, in <a href="/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13</a>, had described the excesses of the Prodigal Son. The Pharisees had heard that parable, and even if they had caught the bearing of the language which portrayed the character of the elder son, had flattered themselves that they were, at all events, free from the guilt of the younger. They had not "wasted their substance in riotous living." Now they were taught that the "goods" committed to them might be wasted in other ways than by being "devoured" in company with "harlots." They were guilty of that sin in proportion as they had failed to use what they had been entrusted with for the good of men and for God's glory. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-31.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord's teaching on the right use of earthly possessions with regard to the prospect of another world, in the form of the two parables of the unjust steward, and Dives and Lazarus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said also unto his</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples</span>. There is no doubt that this important teaching belongs to the last portion of our Lord's life, and it is probable that it is closely connected with the parable of the prodigal son just related. It is not likely that two such weighty sermons had been preached at the same time, but in the evening, or on the following day, or at least on the next sabbath, the same auditory that listened to the prodigal son we believe were startled and enthralled by the story of the unjust steward, and then, or very shortly after, by the awful and vivid picture of life beyond the grave in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. There is a close link of thought between the parable of the unjust steward and that of the prodigal. The heroes of both these narratives, in the first instance, had a considerable share of this world's goods entrusted to their charge, and by both, in the early portions of the story, these goods were misused and wasted. The Greek words used of the "wasting" of the prodigal and of the steward were in both cases the same (<a href="/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>; <a href="/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1</a>). No parable in the New Testament has been so copiously discussed or has received so many end such varying interpretations at the hands of expositors. We will at once put aside all the ingenious, but from our point of view mistaken, interpretations which see in "the steward" the Pharisees, the publicans, Judas Iscariot, or Satan. The parable has a broader, a more direct, a more universally interesting, meaning. It contains a deep and important teaching for <span class="accented">every</span> man or woman who would wish to rank among the followers, of Jesus Christ. Now, our Lord would have all men look forward gravely and calmly to the certain event of their death, and. in view of that event, would have them make careful and thoughtful preparation for the life which was to come after death. To press this most important lesson home, the Master, as his custom was at this late period of his ministry, conveyed his instruction in the form of a parable. The sketch of a steward about to be dismissed from his office, and who thus would be stripped of his income, was a fit emblem of a man about to be removed from this world by death. The steward in the parable-story felt that, when dismissed, he would be as it were alone, stripped of all, and destitute. The soul of such a man, when dead, would be also stripped of everything, would be alone and destitute. The question here might be asked - Why take for the principal figure of the parable so immoral a character as an <span class="accented">unjust</span> steward? The answer is well suggested by Professor Bruce, "For the simple reason that his misbehaviour is the natural explanation of the impending dismissal. Why should a <span class="accented">faithful</span> steward be removed from office? To conceive such a case were to sacrifice probability to a moral scruple." Roughly, then, two things all-important to us are taught here: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that dismissal, death, will certainly come; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that some provision certainly ought to be made for the life that lies beyond - the life that comes <span class="accented">after</span> the dismissal, or death<span class="cmt_word">. There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span> The story of the parable contains little incident. There is the rich man, clearly a noble of high rank, whose residence is at a distance from his estates, the scene of the little story. Over these he has placed, as administrator or factor, the one called here a steward; the revenues of the lands this official has wasted; he appears to have been generally a careless if not a dishonest servant. The owner of the estates, when he becomes aware of the facts of the case, at once gives notice of dismissal to the steward, desiring him, however, before yielding up his office, to give in his accounts. Appalled at the sudden and utter destitution which lay before him, the steward occupies the short time of office yet remaining to him in devising a plan by which he would secure the good offices of certain persons who were in debt to his master. He (the steward) had yet a little time of power remaining before he was turned adrift; he would turn this to account, and would do a good turn to these men, poor neighbours of his, and debtors to his lord, while he was in office, and so win their friendship, and, on the principle that one good turn deserves another, would be able to reckon on their gratitude when all else had failed him. With the immorality of the act by which he won the good will of these debtors of his master we have nothing to do; it is simply a detail of the picture, which is composed of figures and imagery chosen for their fitness to impress the lesson intended to be taught. <span class="accented">Give an account of thy stewardship</span>; <span class="accented">for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span> This taking away the position and privileges of the man represents the act of death, in which God takes away from us all the varied gifts, the possessions, and the powers large or small with which we are eutrusted during our lifetime. Our day of dismissal will be the day of our passing away from this life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] also said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
