The use of Isaiah underscores the authority and divine inspiration of the message. Isaiah, a major prophet, wrote during a time of impending judgment and hope for restoration, and his words are seen as foretelling the coming of John the Baptist as the forerunner to Christ.<p><b>A voice of one calling in the wilderness:</b><br>The "voice" refers to John the Baptist, who preached in the wilderness of Judea. The wilderness symbolizes a place of spiritual renewal and preparation, echoing Israel's history of wandering and transformation. John's ministry in the wilderness fulfills the prophetic imagery of a voice crying out in a desolate place, calling people to repentance and readiness for the Messiah. The wilderness setting also emphasizes separation from the corruption of society and a return to God.<p><b>&#8216;Prepare the way for the Lord:</b><br>This command is a call to spiritual preparation and repentance. In ancient times, preparing a way for a king involved clearing obstacles and making roads passable. Spiritually, it signifies removing sin and obstacles from one's life to receive the Lord. The "Lord" here refers to Jesus Christ, affirming His divine authority and messianic role. This preparation is both individual and communal, urging Israel to be ready for the coming of their Savior.<p><b>make straight paths for Him:</b><br>The imagery of making straight paths suggests moral and spiritual alignment with God's will. It involves correcting one's life and actions to be in accordance with divine standards. This phrase implies urgency and intentionality in preparing for the Lord's arrival. The straight paths symbolize righteousness and truth, contrasting with the crooked ways of sin and disobedience. This call to action is a central theme in John the Baptist's ministry, urging people to live lives worthy of the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah_the_prophet.htm">Isaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>An Old Testament prophet whose writings are often quoted in the New Testament.

The prophet quoted (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>) had been writing in his solitude, or more probably in some great popular assembly preaching to the people. There was doubtless at that time much national trouble threatening Israel; the future of the chosen race looked very dark and gloomy, within and without. We can hear the man of God speaking with intense earnestness, and looking on to brighter times. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned," etc.; and then a sudden burst when the prophet, bending forward and straining his ears to hear some sound none other caught but he, goes on in his rapt utterance - I hear a voice, "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight</span>. The image is a simple one, and in the East one well knows, where the roads are comparatively few, and where they do exist are often in a bad state, when a sovereign is about to visit any part of his dominions, or still more if the march of an army has to be arranged for, the roads require considerable preparation. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:06) describes the advance of the Emperor Vespasian's army, and specially mentions how the pioneers and the vanguard had to make the road even and straight, and, if it were anywhere rough hard to be passed over, <span class="accented">to plane it</span>. There was a Jewish legend that this special pioneering work in the desert was done by the pillar of cloud and fire, which brought low the mountains and filled the valleys before the Israelitic march.
