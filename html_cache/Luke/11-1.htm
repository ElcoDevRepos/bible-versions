Jesus often withdrew to solitary places to pray, as seen in <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>. This practice underscores His dependence on the Father and sets an example for His followers. The specific location is not mentioned, emphasizing the universality of prayer rather than tying it to a particular place. This reflects the Jewish tradition of prayer at set times and places, yet Jesus models a more personal and continuous communion with God.<p><b>one of His disciples requested</b><br>The request from a disciple indicates a desire to learn and grow in spiritual disciplines. It shows the disciples' recognition of Jesus' unique relationship with God and their wish to emulate it. This moment reflects the rabbinic tradition where disciples would seek instruction from their teacher, highlighting the role of Jesus as a rabbi and spiritual leader.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, teach us to pray,</b><br>The title "Lord" signifies respect and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority. The request to be taught to pray suggests that prayer is a learned practice, not just spontaneous communication. This aligns with Jewish customs where prayer was often taught and recited, such as the Shema. The disciples' request indicates their understanding that effective prayer requires guidance and instruction.<p><b>just as John taught his disciples.&#8221;</b><br>This reference to John the Baptist teaching his disciples to pray suggests a common practice among Jewish teachers to instruct their followers in prayer. It highlights the continuity between John's ministry and Jesus', as both emphasized the importance of prayer. This connection also points to the expectation that Jesus, like John, would provide a distinctive prayer model for His followers, setting them apart in their spiritual practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who often withdrew to pray, demonstrating a life of communion with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were eager to learn from Him, including how to pray effectively.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A forerunner to Jesus who also taught his disciples about spiritual practices, including prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/place_of_prayer.htm">Place of Prayer</a></b><br>Although not specified, it is a location where Jesus was engaged in prayer, highlighting the importance of setting aside time and space for communion with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/request_for_teaching.htm">Request for Teaching</a></b><br>The disciple's request signifies a desire for deeper spiritual understanding and practice, reflecting the Jewish tradition of rabbinic teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer.htm">The Importance of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus' example underscores the necessity of prayer in the believer's life.

They listened, unable to follow, or to record what they had heard, and they wished to be able to enter into His spirit and pray as He prayed.<p><span class= "bld">Teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</span>--It seems, at first sight, to follow from this that the disciple who asked this had not been present when the Sermon on the Mount was spoken. It is conceivable, however, that, knowing the pattern prayer which had then been given, he had thought it adapted for the multitude, and not for the special scholars and disciples--too short and simple as compared, on the one hand, with the devotions which John had prescribed to his disciples, as he prescribed also fasting and alms-giving (<a href="/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>; <a href="/luke/3-11.htm" title="He answers and said to them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.">Luke 3:11</a>), and with the fuller utterances, as of rapt communion with God, of his Master. The prayers of John's disciples were probably, like those of the Pharisees, offered three times a day, at the third, the sixth, and the ninth hours, and after the pattern of the well-known "Eighteen Prayers," which made up the Jewish manual of private devotion. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord's teaching on the subject of prayer.</span> Again the scene is far away from Jerusalem; no special note of <span class="accented">time</span> or <span class="accented">place</span> enables us to fix the scene or date with any exactness. Somewhere in the course of the last journeyings towards Jerusalem, related especially in this Gospel, did this scene and its teaching take place. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples</span>. It seems as though some of his disciples - we know at this period many were with him besides the twelve - heard their Master praying. It appeared to them - no doubt, as they caught here and there a word and expression as he prayed, perhaps partly alone, partly to him-self - as though a friend was speaking to a friend; <span class="accented">they</span> would pray like that: would not the Master teach them his beautiful secret? In reply, Jesus repeats to them, in rather an abbreviated form, what, at an earlier period of his ministry, he had taught to the multitudes and the twelve. It was very likely one of the seventy who made this request, who had not been present on the first occasion, when the Lord gave his prayer of prayers to the people. We have already remarked that at this time the twelve, who <span class="accented">had</span> heard it, were probably often absent on mission work. It was a usual practice among the more famous rabbis to give prayer-formulas to their pupils. We have no tradition extant of John the Baptist's prayer here alluded to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[One day]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
