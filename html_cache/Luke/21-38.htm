In the Jewish culture of the time, early morning was a common time for prayer and teaching, aligning with the practice of seeking God at the start of the day. This eagerness reflects the people's recognition of Jesus' authority and wisdom, similar to how the Israelites sought guidance from Moses early in the day (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>).<p><b>all the people</b><br>The phrase "all the people" suggests a large and diverse crowd, indicating Jesus' widespread appeal and the inclusive nature of His ministry. This inclusivity is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus reaches out to various groups, including those marginalized by society, such as tax collectors and sinners (<a href="/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30-32</a>).<p><b>would come to hear Him</b><br>The act of coming to hear Jesus highlights the active pursuit of His teachings. This mirrors the Old Testament tradition of seeking wisdom and instruction from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2.htm">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>. The people's desire to hear Jesus underscores His role as a teacher and prophet, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of one who would teach with authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>).<p><b>at the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Jesus teaching at the temple connects Him to the heart of Jewish worship and tradition.

It may be that the general statement thus given includes the fourth and fifth days of the week of the Passion, but it is remarkable that all three Gospels are silent as to anything that happened on those days till we come to the Paschal Supper. We may, perhaps, reverently conjecture that they were spent by our Lord, in part at least, in Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2</a>), in prayer and meditation, in preparing Himself and the disciples for the coming trials of the Passion. Possibly, also, the narrative of the Woman taken in Adultery, which occupies so strangely doubtful a position in St. John's Gospel, may find its true place here.
