It echoes Old Testament prophetic language, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a> and <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>, where impending judgment or significant change is announced. Jesus is warning of a future time of distress, likely referring to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, a pivotal event in Jewish history.<p><b>when people will say,</b><br>This suggests a shift in societal values and perceptions. The phrase implies a future consensus or common sentiment among people, indicating a reversal of traditional blessings and curses. It reflects a time of such calamity that what was once considered a curse will be seen as a blessing.<p><b>&#8216;Blessed are the barren women,</b><br>In Jewish culture, barrenness was often seen as a curse or a sign of disfavor from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>. However, Jesus predicts a time when being barren will be considered a blessing, highlighting the severity of the coming tribulation. This reversal underscores the desperation and suffering that will make childlessness preferable.<p><b>the wombs that never bore,</b><br>This phrase reinforces the previous statement, emphasizing the blessing of not having children during the impending hardship. It reflects the intense suffering and loss that will make the responsibilities and vulnerabilities of parenthood a burden rather than a joy.<p><b>and breasts that never nursed!&#8217;</b><br>Nursing is a natural extension of motherhood, symbolizing care and nurturing. In the context of this prophecy, the inability to nurse is seen as a blessing, further illustrating the dire circumstances where nurturing a child would be fraught with danger and sorrow. This imagery connects to the lamentations found in the Old Testament, such as <a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-4</a>, where the suffering of children during sieges is poignantly described.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is on His way to be crucified.

Jesus cites that same picture in the very next verse (<a href="/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>), tying His warning to a long-standing prophetic chorus.<p>&#8226; The Lord is not describing a hypothetical mood swing; history records that during the Roman siege of A.D. 70, people indeed envied those who had no children to starve or be slain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Blessed are the barren women</b><p>&#8226; Scripture normally calls childbearing a blessing (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>; <a href="/luke/1-42.htm">Luke 1:42</a>). Here Jesus deliberately reverses that expectation.<p>&#8226; What could make barrenness seem fortunate? Only a catastrophe so severe that to bring life into it would feel cruel.<p>&#8226; His earlier Olivet words line up precisely: &#8220;Woe to those who are pregnant and to nursing mothers in those days!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wombs that never bore</b><p>&#8226; The womb&#8212;ordained to nurture life&#8212;would, in the coming siege, have no safe place to deliver it.<p>&#8226; Lamentations describes mothers whose &#8220;womb became cruel&#8221; under famine (<a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). Deuteronomy&#8217;s covenant warnings had spoken of the same horror (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56-57</a>).<p>&#8226; By citing the womb, Jesus points to mothers&#8217; deepest instinct. When even that instinct is turned upside down, the severity of judgment is unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and breasts that never nursed!</b><p>&#8226; Nursing, a picture of comfort and provision, would give way to scarcity and heartbreak (<a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Mark&#8217;s parallel prophecy repeats the lament for nursing mothers (<a href="/mark/13-17.htm">Mark 13:17</a>), tying it to the &#8220;abomination of desolation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Historically, Josephus records starving mothers during the siege; prophetically, Jesus&#8217; words also foreshadow the final tribulation, when turmoil again overturns the created order (<a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/23-29.htm">Luke 23:29</a> is a sobering announcement: Jerusalem&#8217;s impending judgment will be so dreadful that the normal blessings of motherhood will feel like liabilities. Inverting the usual beatitude language, Jesus amplifies the certainty and severity of the coming siege and, by extension, the ultimate day of the Lord. His warning calls every generation to repentance, alertness, and trust in the One who alone can shelter us when &#8220;the days are coming.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Blessed are the barren.</span>--We must enter into all the passionate desire of Israelite women for offspring, as we see it, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm" title="And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.">Genesis 30:1</a>) and in Hannah (<a href="/context/1_samuel/1-10.htm" title="And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore.">1Samuel 1:10-11</a>), in order to estimate the strangeness of such a beatitude.
