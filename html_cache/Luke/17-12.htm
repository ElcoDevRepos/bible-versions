The setting is likely in the region between Samaria and Galilee, as mentioned earlier in the chapter. This area was a crossroads of Jewish and Samaritan cultures, often leading to tensions but also opportunities for Jesus to demonstrate His message of reconciliation and inclusion. The village setting suggests a smaller, more intimate community, where news of Jesus' arrival would quickly spread.<p><b>He was met by ten lepers</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times referred to a variety of skin diseases, not just what is known today as Hansen's disease. Lepers were considered unclean according to Levitical law (Leviticus 13-14) and were required to live outside the community to prevent contamination. The number ten is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or a group. The fact that ten lepers approached Jesus highlights the severity of their condition and their desperation for healing. This encounter also foreshadows the inclusivity of Jesus' ministry, as lepers were marginalized and ostracized from society.<p><b>They stood at a distance</b><br>Lepers were required by law to maintain a distance from others to prevent the spread of their disease (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). This physical separation symbolizes the spiritual and social isolation experienced by those deemed unclean. The distance also underscores the faith of the lepers, as they recognized Jesus' authority and power to heal even from afar. This act of standing at a distance while seeking help parallels the spiritual distance between humanity and God, which Jesus came to bridge through His ministry and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is entering a village.

The verse shows His intentional reach to every place, the completeness of human need represented in the ten afflicted men, and the humble separation that sin and sickness bring. It sets the stage for Christ&#8217;s gracious intervention, assuring readers that no place is too obscure, no crowd too large, and no gap too wide for the Savior to bridge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Ten men that were lepers.</span>--On the general character of leprosy, see Notes on <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>. As only one of these was a Samaritan, it seems probable that the unnamed village was, as has been said, on the border-land of the two provinces. It is, perhaps, significant that our Lord takes neither of the usual caravan roads--one of which passed through Samaria, the other through Peraea--but chooses one for Himself that led through the one district into the other. The herding together of those who were shut out from all other fellowship has its parallel in the four lepers of <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm" title="And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?">2Kings 7:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which stood afar off.</span>--In this case, then, there was no running and falling at the feet of Jesus, as in the earlier case of healing.

These had no doubt heard of the many lepers who had been healed by the Galilaean Teacher who was then drawing nigh the village. They did not venture to approach him, but they attracted his attention with their hoarse, sad cry. The legal distance which these unfortunates were compelled to keep from passers-by was a hundred paces. He does not seem to have touched them, or <span class="accented">talked</span> with them, but with an impressive majesty bids them go and return thanks for their cure, which his will had already accomplished. They evidently believed implicitly in his healing power, for without further question they went on their way as he had commanded, and as they went the poor sufferers felt a new and, to them, a quite strange thrill of health course through their veins; they felt their prayer was granted, and that the fell disease had left them. They were not sent to the capital city; any priest in any town was qualified to pronounce on the completeness of a cure in this malady (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2-32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
