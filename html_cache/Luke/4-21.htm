It signifies the start of His teaching ministry, which is a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative. Jesus, having read from the scroll of Isaiah, now transitions from reading to teaching, a common practice in Jewish synagogues where the reader would often expound on the text. This moment is significant as it sets the tone for His ministry, emphasizing His role as a teacher and prophet.<p><b>&#8220;Today this Scripture is fulfilled</b><br>The word "Today" emphasizes the immediacy and present reality of the fulfillment of prophecy. Jesus is referring to the passage He just read from <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which speaks of the anointed one bringing good news to the poor, freedom for the captives, and sight for the blind. By declaring its fulfillment, Jesus is identifying Himself as the Messiah, the anointed one sent by God. This claim is profound, as it asserts that the long-awaited promises of God are being realized in Him. The concept of fulfillment is central to the Gospel message, as it ties the Old Testament prophecies to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ.<p><b>in your hearing.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "in your hearing" indicates that the fulfillment of the prophecy is not just a distant or abstract concept but is happening in the presence of those listening. It underscores the personal and immediate nature of Jesus' ministry. The audience in the synagogue, familiar with the messianic expectations, would have understood the gravity of His claim. This statement challenges the listeners to recognize and respond to the revelation of God's plan unfolding before them. It also highlights the importance of faith and perception, as the fulfillment of God's promises requires acknowledgment and acceptance by those who hear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the synagogue in Nazareth, declaring the fulfillment of prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The town where Jesus grew up and where this event takes place.
