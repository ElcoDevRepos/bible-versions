The "good soil" symbolizes those who are receptive and prepared to receive the gospel. In the agricultural context of ancient Israel, good soil was crucial for a successful harvest, emphasizing the importance of a heart ready to accept divine truth. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references to fruitful land, such as in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water.<p><b>are those with a noble and good heart</b><br>A "noble and good heart" indicates a person whose inner character is aligned with God's righteousness. This echoes the biblical theme of the heart as the center of moral and spiritual life (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The Greek words used here suggest integrity and moral excellence, qualities that are essential for true discipleship. This aligns with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus describes the blessed as those pure in heart.<p><b>who hear the word</b><br>Hearing the word implies not just auditory reception but an understanding and acceptance of the gospel message. In the Jewish tradition, hearing is often linked with obedience, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of being attentive and responsive to God's voice, as emphasized in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the message of Christ.<p><b>cling to it</b><br>To "cling to it" suggests a steadfast commitment to the teachings of Jesus. This perseverance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to hold fast to their faith amidst trials (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). The imagery of clinging implies a deep-rooted attachment, similar to the vine and branches metaphor in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, where abiding in Christ is essential for spiritual fruitfulness.<p><b>and by persevering produce a crop</b><br>Perseverance is key to spiritual growth and maturity. The crop represents the visible evidence of a transformed life, characterized by the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). This outcome is not immediate but requires ongoing faithfulness and endurance, reflecting the biblical principle that true faith is demonstrated through works (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The harvest imagery also connects to eschatological themes, where the final gathering of believers is likened to a harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching His disciples and the crowd about the Kingdom of God through the Parable of the Sower.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being instructed on the nature of true discipleship and the Kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of listeners who hear Jesus' parables, representing various responses to His message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Symbolic of Jesus or anyone who spreads the Word of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_soil.htm">The Good Soil</a></b><br>Represents those who receive the Word with a noble and good heart, leading to spiritual fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_condition_of_the_heart.htm">The Condition of the Heart</a></b><br>The "noble and good heart" is crucial for receiving and nurturing the Word of God.

In this portraiture of the fourth class of our Lord's great life-picture of hearers of and inquirers concerning religion, the Greek words rendered in the Authorized Version "honest" and "good" ("in an honest and good heart ") were words well known and in familiar use among the widely spread Greek-speaking peoples for whom especially St. Luke's Gospel was compiled. Professor Bruce ('Parabolic Teaching of Christ,' ch. 1.) remarks that "the man who united the two qualities expressed by the term 'honest' (better rendered 'noble') and 'good,' represented the beau-ideal of manhood. He was one whose aim was noble, and who was generously devoted to his aim. The expression rendered 'honest' (better translated 'noble,' <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) has reference to aims or chief ends, and describes one whose mind is raised above moral vulgarity, and is bent, not on money-making and such low pursuits, but on the attainment of wisdom, holiness, and righteousness. The epithet rendered 'good' (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes generous self-abandonment in the prosecution of lofty ends; large-heartedness, magnanimous, overflowing devotion." Mary of Bethany, with her devoted love and her generous friendship; the centurion Cornelius, with his fervent piety and his noble generosity towards a despised and hated race; Barnabas, with his splendid liberality, his utter absence of care for self, his bright, loving trust in human nature, his true charity, "bearing all things, hoping all things;" - are good examples, drawn from different sexes and from varied races, and out of diverse paths of life, of these true inquirers, who not only hear the Word, but keep it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [seeds]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(To)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
