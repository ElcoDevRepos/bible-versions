In the Old Testament, God used ravens to feed Elijah during a time of drought (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>). Ravens are unclean birds according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>), yet Jesus uses them to illustrate God's care, emphasizing that God's provision transcends human distinctions of clean and unclean.<p><b>They do not sow or reap:</b><br>This phrase highlights the natural order of creation, where ravens do not engage in agricultural activities like humans. It underscores the idea that God's creation is sustained by His providence without human intervention. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God provides for all living creatures.<p><b>They have no storehouse or barn;</b><br>Ravens do not gather or store food, contrasting with human practices of storing and planning for the future. This echoes the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where reliance on material wealth is shown to be futile. The absence of a storehouse or barn in the life of a raven serves as a metaphor for trusting in God's daily provision.<p><b>yet God feeds them:</b><br>This statement affirms God's active role in sustaining His creation. It reflects the teaching found in <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>, which states that God provides food for the animals. The emphasis is on God's faithfulness and care, encouraging believers to trust in His provision.<p><b>How much more valuable you are than the birds!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the greater worth of humans in God's eyes, aligning with the biblical teaching that humans are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). It reassures believers of their value and God's care for them, echoing <a href="/matthew/10-31.htm">Matthew 10:31</a>, where Jesus tells His followers they are worth more than many sparrows.

Our responsibility is not anxious stockpiling but confident trust, expressed in faithful work and single-hearted pursuit of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24, 25) <span class= "bld">Consider the ravens.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26-27</a>. Here, however, we have the more specific "ravens" instead of the wider "fowls of the air," as another example of independence. The choice of the special illustration was possibly determined by the language of the Psalmist, "He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry" (<a href="/psalms/147-9.htm" title="He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.">Psalm 147:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them... Consider the lilies... they toil not, they spin not: and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these</span>. What a contrast between the life of the rich and prosperous landowner just related, whose whole heart and soul were concentrated on a toil which should procure him dainty food and costly raiment, and these fowls fed by God so abundantly, and those flowers clothed by God so royally! The ravens knew nothing of the anxious care and the restless toil of the rich man in the midst of which he died, and yet they lived. The lilies simply grew, and God's hand painted the rich and gorgeous clothing for each golden-jewelled flower; Solomon, the splendid Jewish king, the example of all that was magnificent, was never arrayed, men knew, like one of these lilies. With such a God above them, who surely loved each one as he never loved a bird or flower, was it worth while to wear a life away in toiling for tess than what God simply <span class="accented">gave to</span> raven and to lily? Such was the Master's argument, adorned, we may well conceive, with all the beauty and force of Eastern illustration. We possess, after all, but a scant <span class="accented">resume</span> of these Divine sermons. To apostle and chosen missionary his words had a peculiar interest. He bade them, in coming days of poverty and abandonment, never to lose heart. They would remember <span class="accented">then</span> their loved Teacher's words that day when he spoke of the fate of one whose life had been wasted in filling his storehouses and his barns; would remember how he turned from the foolish, toiling rich man, and told them of the birds and flowers, and how God tenderly cared even for such soulless things. Did they think he would ever lose sight of them, his chosen servants? They might surely reckon on the loving care of that Master to whose cause they were giving their life-service. Yet have these and other like words of the great Teacher been often misunderstood; and St. Paul's earnest and repeated exhortations to his converts - not to neglect honest toil, but by it to win bread for themselves, and something withal to be generous with to those poorer than they - were his protest against taking the Masterwords in too literal a sense, and using them as a pretext for a dreamy and idle life.

The Savior, probably, had each of these and other specimens of the flora of Palestine in his mind, when he spoke of the inimitable beauty and the matchless splendor of these flowers of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Consider</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(katano&#275;sate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2657.htm">Strong's 2657: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take note of, perceive, consider carefully, discern, detect, make account of.
