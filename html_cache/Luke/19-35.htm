The act of leading the colt to Jesus signifies obedience to His instructions given earlier in the chapter. The colt, an unbroken young donkey, symbolizes humility and peace, contrasting with the war horses of earthly kings. This event takes place near Bethphage and Bethany, close to the Mount of Olives, a location with significant eschatological importance in Jewish tradition.<p><b>threw their cloaks over it</b><br>The act of throwing cloaks over the colt is a gesture of honor and respect, akin to laying out a red carpet. In ancient times, cloaks were valuable possessions, and laying them down was a sign of submission and recognition of Jesus' authority. This action mirrors the acknowledgment of Jesus as the promised Messiah, a theme consistent with the Old Testament practice of honoring royalty (see <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>).<p><b>and put Jesus on it</b><br>Placing Jesus on the colt signifies His acceptance of His role as the Messiah and King. This moment marks the beginning of His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, a pivotal event in the Passion Week. The imagery of Jesus riding on a donkey rather than a horse emphasizes His mission of peace and salvation, not military conquest. This act also connects to the Davidic lineage, as Solomon rode on a mule during his coronation (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33-44</a>), reinforcing Jesus' rightful claim to the throne of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, fulfilling prophecy by entering Jerusalem on a colt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who obey His instructions to bring the colt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/colt.htm">Colt</a></b><br>A young donkey, symbolizing peace and humility, used by Jesus for His entry into Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus is entering, significant as the center of Jewish worship and prophecy fulfillment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloaks.htm">Cloaks</a></b><br>Garments laid on the colt, symbolizing honor and submission to Jesus as King.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a colt fulfills Zechariah's prophecy, affirming His identity as the Messiah.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_peace.htm">Symbol of Peace</a></b><br>Riding a colt, rather than a warhorse, signifies Jesus' mission of peace and humility, contrasting worldly expectations of a conquering king.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_honor.htm">Obedience and Honor</a></b><br>The disciples' actions in bringing the colt and laying their cloaks demonstrate obedience and honor towards Jesus, setting an example for believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_kingship.htm">Recognition of Kingship</a></b><br>The act of laying cloaks signifies the recognition of Jesus' authority and kingship, inviting believers to submit to His lordship in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_declaration_of_faith.htm">Public Declaration of Faith</a></b><br>Jesus' public entry into Jerusalem challenges believers to openly declare their faith and allegiance to Him, even in the face of opposition.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_19_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 19:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_35_Jesus_fulfills_prophecy.htm">How does Luke 19:35 demonstrate Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Colt_s_role_in_Jesus_kingship_in_Luke_19_35.htm">What significance does the colt have in understanding Jesus' kingship in Luke 19:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Luke_19_35_obedience_today.htm">How can we apply the disciples' obedience in Luke 19:35 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_19_35_Zech_9_9.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Luke 19:35 and Zechariah 9:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_35_Recognize_Jesus_authority.htm">How does Luke 19:35 encourage us to recognize Jesus' authority in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_choose_a_colt_in_Luke_19_35.htm">Why did Jesus choose a colt for His entry in Luke 19:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_35_and_Old_Testament_prophecy.htm">How does Luke 19:35 fulfill Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_untie_the_colt_in_Luke_19_35.htm">What is the significance of the colt being untied in Luke 19:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_the_colt_stay_calm_in_the_crowd.htm">In Luke 19:35-36, how could a previously unridden colt remain calm amid a jubilant crowd without any training or acclimatization?
