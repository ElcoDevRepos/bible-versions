The son, representing a repentant sinner, acknowledges his wrongdoing. In the cultural context of the time, a son addressing his father in such a manner would signify deep respect and recognition of authority. This declaration is a pivotal moment in the parable, illustrating the beginning of reconciliation.<p><b>&#8216;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</b><br>The use of "Father" signifies a personal relationship, emphasizing the familial bond that has been strained by the son's actions. "Sinned against heaven" reflects a Jewish understanding of sin as an offense against God, aligning with <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where David acknowledges his sin against God. The dual confession "against heaven and against you" underscores the gravity of his actions, affecting both divine and human relationships. This mirrors the biblical principle that sin often has both vertical (Godward) and horizontal (manward) dimensions.<p><b>I am no longer worthy to be called your son.</b><br>This statement reveals the son's deep sense of unworthiness and repentance. In the cultural context, a son who squandered his inheritance would be seen as having brought shame upon his family, potentially leading to disownment. The son's acknowledgment of his unworthiness is a critical step in the process of repentance, aligning with the biblical theme of humility before restoration, as seen in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up." This phrase also foreshadows the grace and forgiveness that the father, representing God, is about to extend, highlighting the theme of redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who squandered his inheritance in reckless living and returned to his father in repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who is loving and forgiving, welcoming the repentant son back with open arms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_country.htm">The Far Country</a></b><br>Symbolizes a life of sin and separation from God, where the prodigal son wasted his inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The pivotal event where the son acknowledges his sin and returns to his father, seeking forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_confession.htm">The Confession</a></b><br>The son's admission of sin against heaven and his father, highlighting his repentance and humility.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_is_key.htm">Repentance is Key</a></b><br>True repentance involves acknowledging our sins and turning back to God, as demonstrated by the prodigal son.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unconditional_love.htm">God's Unconditional Love</a></b><br>The father's response shows that God's love and forgiveness are always available, regardless of our past.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>The son's admission of unworthiness teaches us the importance of approaching God with humility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_reconciliation.htm">Restoration and Reconciliation</a></b><br>God desires to restore and reconcile us to Himself, just as the father restored his son to his family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_return.htm">The Joy of Return</a></b><br>There is great joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, reflecting the father's joy at his son's return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_15_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 15:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_21_Repentance_s_role_in_Christianity.htm">How does Luke 15:21 illustrate the importance of repentance in Christian life?

The contrite soul does not play with its contrition, or seek to vary its expression. But the change is as suggestive as the repetition. Now that he has seen his father, he cannot bring himself to say again, "Make me as one of thy hired servants." That had been a natural and right wish before; it would savour of unreality and hypocrisy now. This also has its analogue in the history of true penitents. In the first stirrings of contrition they stand afar off, and as they confess their sins hardly dare to hope for restoration to the blessedness of sons; but when they have felt the Father's kiss, though still confessing that they are unworthy to be called sons, they cannot be satisfied with anything less than sonship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son</span>. Many, though not all, of the older authorities add here (apparently taking them from ver. 19) the words, "make me as one of thy hired (servants)." The selfsame words of store original resolution are repeated. They had been stamped deep into the sad heart which so intensely desired a return to the old quiet, pure home-life; but now in his father's presence he feels all is forgiven and forgotten, therefore he no longer asks to be made as one of the servants. He feels that great love will be satisfied with nothing less than restoring him, the erring one, to all the glories and happiness of the old life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
