In biblical times, stewardship was a common practice, where servants were entrusted with managing their master's property. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Joseph, for example, was a steward in Potiphar's house (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4-6</a>). Faithfulness in small matters is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are rewarded based on their management of their master's resources. The idea is that God entrusts individuals with resources, talents, and opportunities, and expects them to manage these wisely and faithfully.<p><b>who will give you belongings of your own?</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a future reward or responsibility that is contingent upon one's current faithfulness. In the cultural context of the time, inheritance and ownership were significant, often tied to one's ability to manage and grow what was given. The principle here is that those who prove trustworthy in handling what belongs to others will be entrusted with their own. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual truths, where faithfulness in earthly matters reflects one's readiness for greater spiritual responsibilities. The concept is echoed in <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, where the faithful servant is given authority over cities. This also points to the eschatological promise of believers receiving their inheritance in the Kingdom of God, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where an imperishable inheritance is reserved for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching His disciples about stewardship and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being instructed on the principles of managing resources and responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/parable_of_the_unjust_steward.htm">Parable of the Unjust Steward</a></b><br>This teaching is part of a larger parable where Jesus discusses the behavior of a steward who mismanages his master's resources.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the broader context and are often criticized by Jesus for their love of money and lack of true faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship.htm">Stewardship</a></b><br>The central theme of this passage, focusing on the responsibility and management of what is entrusted to someone by another.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>Being faithful in managing what belongs to others is a test of character and integrity.

The Roman poet had seen that to boast of such things was the emptiest of all vanities--<p>"At genus, et proavos, et quae non fecimus ipsi,<p>Vix ea nostra voco."<p>[" Lineage and name, and all that our own powers<p>Have not wrought for us, these I scarce call ours."]<p><span class= "bld">That which is your own?</span>--This is obviously identical with the "true riches" of the preceding verse. Wisdom, holiness, peace, these the world has not given, and cannot take away; and even looking to God as the great Giver of these as of other good and perfect gifts, it may be said that they are bestowed by Him as a possession in fee, the reward of the faithful stewardship of all lower gifts and opportunities, so that, though His gift, they become, in very deed, our own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's.</span> Here we have our earthly possessions plainly spoken of as the goods of another, that is, of God, and of these goods we are but the temporary stewards. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall give you that which is your own?</span> We have here a very magnificent promise. Although on earth man can possess nothing of his own - here he is but a steward for a time of property belonging to another - yet a prospect is held out to him that, if he be found faithful in the trust while on earth, in the world to come something will be given to him really and truly his own.
