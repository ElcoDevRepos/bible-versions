It was a central aspect of Jewish life and religious practice. Jesus often performed miracles on the Sabbath, challenging the Pharisees' legalistic interpretations and emphasizing the spirit of the law over the letter (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>).<p><b>Jesus entered the synagogue</b><br>Synagogues were local centers for worship, teaching, and community gatherings. They played a crucial role in Jewish religious life, especially after the Babylonian exile when the temple was less accessible. Jesus frequently taught in synagogues, as seen in <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>, where He read from Isaiah and declared His messianic mission.<p><b>and was teaching</b><br>Teaching was a primary aspect of Jesus' ministry. He taught with authority, often using parables and direct instruction to reveal the truths of God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>). His teachings challenged existing religious norms and offered a deeper understanding of God's will.<p><b>and a man was there whose right hand was withered</b><br>A withered hand would have been a significant disability, affecting the man's ability to work and participate fully in society. The mention of the "right hand" is notable, as the right hand was often associated with strength and skill (<a href="/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>).
