In the cultural context of first-century Judea, giving to the temple was a common practice, often done publicly to display one's piety and status. The term "surplus" indicates that these individuals gave from their abundance, meaning their contributions did not affect their lifestyle or financial security. This act can be compared to the Pharisees' behavior, who were often criticized by Jesus for their outward displays of religiosity without genuine sacrifice or humility (<a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>).<p><b>but she out of her poverty</b><br>The contrast here is stark. The "she" refers to the poor widow, a figure often representing vulnerability and marginalization in biblical times. Widows in ancient Israel were typically without a means of financial support, making her act of giving even more significant. This phrase underscores her dire economic situation, yet she chooses to give despite her lack. This act of faith and trust in God is reminiscent of the widow of Zarephath, who provided for Elijah out of her meager resources (<a href="/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10-16</a>).<p><b>has put in all she had to live on.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the widow's sacrifice. Unlike the wealthy, who gave from their excess, she gave everything she had, demonstrating complete dependence on God for her sustenance. This act of giving is a profound expression of faith and mirrors the sacrificial nature of Jesus Christ, who gave His life for humanity. The widow's offering is a practical illustration of the principle found in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul speaks of giving as an act of the heart, not out of compulsion. Her action is a prophetic type of the ultimate sacrifice Jesus would make, giving His all for the salvation of mankind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple and observing the actions of those around Him.
