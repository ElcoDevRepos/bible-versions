In the cultural context of first-century Judea, addressing someone as "Lord" could denote respect or acknowledgment of a teacher or master. This reflects the growing recognition of Jesus' role and authority among the people. The questioner remains unnamed, suggesting that the inquiry could represent a common concern among the followers or the general populace.<p><b>&#8220;will only a few people be saved?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects a theological concern prevalent in Jewish thought at the time. Many Jews believed that salvation was primarily for Israel, with a focus on the faithful remnant. The question implies an understanding of salvation as a selective process, possibly influenced by teachings from the Hebrew Scriptures about the remnant of Israel (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>). It also touches on eschatological themes, as salvation was often associated with the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>Jesus answered,</b><br>Jesus' response to this question is crucial, as it provides insight into His teaching on salvation. His answer often challenges prevailing assumptions and redirects focus from speculative theology to practical discipleship. In the broader context of the Gospels, Jesus frequently emphasizes personal responsibility, repentance, and faith as key components of salvation, rather than relying solely on ethnic or religious identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is approached with a question about salvation.

Was he thinking of salvation in the higher Christian sense of the term, or of safety from that destruction of which Christ had spoken as coming on the impenitent people? In the mind of the questioner the two things may have been blended together, but the answer clearly points to the former, and we have sufficient evidence that such questions were agitating men's minds in the apocryphal Revelation known as the Second Book of Esdras. This book is probably (in part, at least, certainly, see <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-28.htm" title="Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.">2 Esdras 8:28-29</a>), post-Christian, and has been assigned to the time of Nero, or Domitian, or Trajan; but it reflects with a wonderful fulness the fevered, anxious thoughts that were working among both Jews and Gentiles, and among those none is so prominent as that "many are created, but few shall be saved" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-1.htm" title="And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.">2 Esdras 8:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-3.htm" title="There be many created, but few shall be saved.">2 Esdras 8:3</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-55.htm" title="And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.">2 Esdras 8:55</a>). Among the strange cabbalistic fancies of the Rabbis, one was an attempt to fix the number of the saved by the numerical value of the letters of this or that text that prophesied of the Kingdom of Heaven. Assuming the question to be of this nature, its form indicates that it was a speculative inquiry. A man anxious and in earnest would have asked, "What must I do to be saved?" And, being a speculative question, our Lord put it aside, gave no direct answer, and sought to force the man back on the thought of what was needed that he himself might take his place in that company. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-30.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus replies to the question of</span> "<span class="accented">Are</span> <span class="accented">there few that be saved</span>?" <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?</span> The immediate circumstance which called out this question is not recorded, but the general tone of the Master's later teaching, especially on the subject of his kingdom of the future, had disturbed the vision of many in Israel, who loved to dwell on the exclusion of all save the chosen race from the glories of the world to come. The words of the Second Book of Esdras, written perhaps forty or fifty years after this time, well reflect this selfish spirit of harsh exclusiveness, peculiarly a characteristic of the Jew in the days of our Lord. "The Most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few" (2 Esdr. 8:1). "There be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved: like as a wave is greater than a drop" (2 Esdr. 9:15, 16). Other passages breathing a similar spirit might be quoted. What relics we possess of Jewish literature of this period all reflect the same stern, jealous, exclusive spirit. The questioner here either hoped to get from the popular Master some statement which might be construed into an approval of this national spirit of hatred of everything that was not Jewish, or, if Jesus chose to combat these selfish hopes, the Master's words might then be quoted to the people as unpatriotic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Lord,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyrie)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
