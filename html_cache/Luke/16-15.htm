This interaction occurs after the parable of the shrewd manager, highlighting the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders. The setting is likely in Judea, where Jesus often taught in parables to convey deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>You are the ones who justify yourselves before men</b><br>The Pharisees were known for their outward displays of piety and righteousness, seeking approval and admiration from others. This behavior is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. The Pharisees' self-justification contrasts with the biblical teaching that true righteousness comes from God alone (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>).<p><b>but God knows your hearts</b><br>This statement underscores God's omniscience and the biblical truth that He looks beyond outward appearances to the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It serves as a warning that human judgment is limited and often flawed, while God's judgment is perfect and all-knowing. This theme is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>, where God searches the heart and examines the mind.<p><b>For what is prized among men</b><br>Worldly values often prioritize wealth, status, and power, which the Pharisees sought.

This statement aligns with the teachings of the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus blesses the poor in spirit and the meek. It also reflects the prophetic tradition, where God calls for justice and mercy over ritualistic observance (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Pharisees and teaching His disciples about the dangers of hypocrisy and the true nature of righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Israel known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The word there used, "this man went down to his house <span class= "ital">justified</span> rather than the other," is obviously a reference to what is reported here.

The part the Pharisees played in public imposed upon the people. The great influence which they exercised was in great measure due to the respect generally felt for their strict and religious lives. The hypocrisy of this famous sect - it was probably in many cases unconscious hypocrisy - and the false colouring which it gave religion, contributed not a little to the state of things which led to the final disruption of the Jewish nation as a nation some forty years after these words were spoken. It is only a student of the Talmud who can form any notion of the Pharisee mind; a superficial study even of parts of this strange, mighty collection will show why our Lord was so seemingly hard in his rebukes of these often earnest and religious men; it will show, too, why the same Divine Master at times seemed to change his words of bitter wrath into accents of the tenderest sympathy and love. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. Especially alluding to that haughty pride of men in wealth and money, which, after all, is not theirs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
