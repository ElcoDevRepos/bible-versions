Baptism, in its literal sense, involves immersion in water, symbolizing purification and initiation. Here, it signifies Jesus' immersion into suffering and the fulfillment of His mission. This concept is echoed in <a href="/mark/10-38.htm">Mark 10:38-39</a>, where Jesus speaks of the "cup" and "baptism" He must endure, indicating the trials and sacrificial death He will face. The use of "baptism" highlights the depth and intensity of the experience, as it involves complete submission to God's will.<p><b>and how distressed I am</b><br>The term "distressed" reflects Jesus' human emotions and the weight of His mission. It indicates a deep emotional turmoil and anticipation of the suffering He will endure. This distress is not due to fear of physical pain alone but encompasses the spiritual burden of bearing the sins of humanity. <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7-8</a> speaks to Jesus' prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears, emphasizing His genuine human experience of distress. This phrase underscores the dual nature of Christ, fully divine yet fully human, experiencing real emotions.<p><b>until it is accomplished!</b><br>"Accomplished" refers to the completion of Jesus' mission through His death and resurrection. This fulfillment is central to the salvation narrative, as it signifies the completion of God's redemptive plan. The term echoes Jesus' final words on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), marking the culmination of His earthly ministry and the atonement for sin. The use of "until" indicates a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the inevitability and purposefulness of His mission. This accomplishment is prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant's role in redemption is outlined, and it connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is expressing His anticipation and distress regarding the suffering He is about to endure.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>In this context, "baptism" refers metaphorically to Jesus' impending suffering and crucifixion, rather than the traditional water baptism.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event that Jesus is alluding to, where He will undergo immense suffering for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' reference to "baptism" underscores the centrality of His mission to suffer and die for humanity's sins.

(See Notes on <a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>, and <a href="/mark/10-38.htm" title="But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask: can you drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?">Mark 10:38</a>.) The baptism of which the Lord now speaks is that of one who is come into deep waters, so that the floods pass over him, over whose head have passed and are passing the waves and billows of many and great sorrows. Yet here, too, the Son of Man does not shrink or draw back. What He felt most keenly, in His human nature, was the pain, the constraint of expectation. He was, in that perfect humanity of His, harassed and oppressed, as other sufferers have been, by the thought of what was coming, more than by the actual suffering when it came.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have a baptism to he baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</span> The baptism he here speaks of was the baptism of pain and suffering and death - what we call the Passion of the Lord. He knew it must all be gone through, to bring about the blessed result for which he left his home in heaven; but he looked on to it, nevertheless, with terror and shrinking. "He is under pressure," says Godet, "to enter into this suffering because he is in haste to get out of it, mournfully impatient to have done with a painful task." This passage of the discourse of Jesus here has been called "a prelude of Gethsemane." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
