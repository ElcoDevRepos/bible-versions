It suggests a focus on earthly pleasures and a lack of awareness or concern for impending judgment. In biblical context, eating and drinking often symbolize indulgence and distraction from spiritual matters (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38</a>). This mirrors the days of Noah, where people were oblivious to the warnings of God through Noah, who is described as a "preacher of righteousness" (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><b>marrying and being given in marriage</b><br>Marriage is a God-ordained institution (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), but here it signifies the continuation of life as usual, with no heed to the warnings of divine judgment. The cultural context of marriage in ancient times involved significant social and familial arrangements, indicating that society was fully engaged in its customs and traditions. This phrase parallels the times of Lot in Sodom, where life continued without regard for moral decay (<a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-29</a>).<p><b>up to the day Noah entered the ark</b><br>This marks a specific point of transition from normalcy to divine intervention. Noah's entry into the ark signifies obedience and faith in God's word, contrasting with the world's ignorance and disbelief. The ark itself is a type of Christ, offering salvation and refuge from judgment (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>). The historical context of the ark, as described in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, underscores God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>Then the flood came and destroyed them all</b><br>The flood represents God's righteous judgment on a sinful world (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>). It serves as a historical and prophetic warning of future judgment, as Jesus uses this event to illustrate the suddenness of His return (<a href="/matthew/24-39.htm">Matthew 24:39</a>). The total destruction emphasizes the severity of ignoring God's warnings and the finality of His judgment. The flood narrative is supported by various ancient flood accounts, though the biblical account uniquely highlights divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.

Nothing seems abnormal or urgent. Jesus points to the ordinariness of those pre-Flood days to show how quickly judgment can overtake the unsuspecting (cf. <a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38</a>; <a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>). The issue is not food or drink themselves, but careless absorption in temporal comforts while ignoring God&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Marrying and being given in marriage</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;marrying and being given in marriage.&#8221; Weddings symbolize long-term planning and future hopes, yet that culture&#8217;s confidence was misplaced. Marriage is God-ordained (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), but when pursuits&#8212;even good ones&#8212;push God aside, they become snares (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29-31</a>). <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a> hints that marriage in Noah&#8217;s day disregarded God&#8217;s design, mirroring the self-centered &#8220;lovers of pleasure&#8221; Paul describes (<a href="/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Up to the day Noah entered the ark</b><p>Life went on &#8220;up to the day Noah entered the ark.&#8221; God&#8217;s patience reached its limit (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>). For 120 years Noah built and preached righteousness (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>), yet only when he stepped into the ark did the window of mercy close (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>). The phrase underscores that divine deadlines often arrive with no advance notice to the unresponsive heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the flood came</b><p>&#8220;Then the flood came&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-12</a>). Judgment arrived suddenly, irresistibly, and exactly as God had said. Jesus uses this to warn that His return will likewise be swift and unexpected (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>). The lesson: seek the Lord &#8220;while He may be found&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And destroyed them all</b><p>The flood &#8220;destroyed them all&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>). No partial verdict, no exceptions outside the ark. Noah&#8217;s family was saved, not by moral superiority, but by obedient faith in God&#8217;s provision&#8212;a foreshadowing of salvation in Christ (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>; 3:6-7). Jesus stresses the totality of judgment to drive home the urgency of repentance (<a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/17-27.htm">Luke 17:27</a> teaches that ordinary life can lull people into spiritual indifference, yet God&#8217;s promised judgment arrives suddenly and comprehensively. Just as the ark was the sole refuge in Noah&#8217;s day, Christ is the only refuge now. Therefore, stay alert and ready for &#8220;the day the Son of Man is revealed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-30.htm">Luke 17:30</a>), living each moment in faith and obedience while awaiting &#8220;our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">They did eat, they drank.</span>--Better, as in St. Matthew, <span class= "ital">they were eating and drinking, marrying,</span> . . .; the tense throughout being that which implies continuous and repeated action.<p><span class= "bld">The flood.</span>--The Greek word is always used in the New Testament for the deluge of Noah, that meaning having been stamped on it by the use of it in the LXX. version in <a href="/genesis/6-17.htm" title="And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.">Genesis 6:17</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/7-6.htm" title="And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.">Genesis 7:6-7</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-10.htm" title="And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were on the earth.">Genesis 7:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-17.htm" title="And the flood was forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.">Genesis 7:17</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[People] were eating</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#963;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;sthion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2068.htm">Strong's 2068: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened for a primary edo; used only in certain tenses, the rest being supplied by phago; to eat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] drinking,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epinon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4095.htm">Strong's 4095: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drink, imbibe.
