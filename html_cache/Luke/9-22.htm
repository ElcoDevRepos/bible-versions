The necessity of suffering is emphasized by the word "must," indicating divine purpose and fulfillment of prophecy, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant. This suffering is not incidental but integral to His mission.<p><b>He said.</b><br>This indicates Jesus is speaking directly to His disciples, providing them with a revelation of His mission. It underscores the importance of His words as a direct teaching moment, preparing them for the events to come.<p><b>He must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes,</b><br>The rejection by these groups highlights the opposition from the Jewish religious leadership. The elders, chief priests, and scribes represent the Sanhedrin, the ruling council in Jerusalem. This rejection fulfills prophecies like <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, where the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone. It also reflects the broader theme of Jesus being a stumbling block to those who do not believe.<p><b>and He must be killed</b><br>This phrase points to the crucifixion, a central event in Christian theology. The necessity of His death is tied to the atonement for sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, which states that without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. Jesus' death is not a defeat but a divine plan for redemption.<p><b>and on the third day be raised to life.</b><br>The resurrection on the third day is a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over death and His divine nature. This event is foreshadowed in <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>, where Jonah spends three days in the belly of the fish, and it fulfills Jesus' own predictions, as well as Old Testament typology.

"See how," as Riggenbach, quoted by Godet, says ('Vie de Jesus,' p. 318), "Jesus was obliged, in the very moment of self-revelation, to veil himself, when he had lighted the fire to cover it again." This dark and terrible prediction came upon the disciples evidently as something new. It was their Master's reply to their confession of faith in him. It said in other words, "You are right in your conception of me and my work. I am the promised King Messiah; but this part of my reign will be made up of affliction and mourning and woe. The great council of the people will reject me, and I shall only enter into my grand Messianic kingdom through the gate of suffering and of death. But do you, my own, be of good cheer. Three days after that death I shall rise again." The enumeration of "elders, chief priests, and scribes" is simply a popular way of describing the great council of the Jewish nation, the Sanhedrin, which was composed of these three important and influential sections of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
