This context is part of a larger discourse where Jesus teaches about vigilance and readiness for His return. The use of "answered" suggests a response to a question or a continuation of a teaching moment, emphasizing the importance of understanding and applying His teachings.<p><b>Who then is the faithful and wise manager</b><br>The "faithful and wise manager" is a metaphor for a disciple or leader in the Christian community. Faithfulness and wisdom are key virtues in biblical leadership, reflecting a deep commitment to God's will and the ability to apply knowledge effectively. This phrase challenges believers to examine their own stewardship and readiness in serving God's purposes.<p><b>whom the master puts in charge of his servants</b><br>The "master" symbolizes God or Christ, who entrusts responsibilities to His followers. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are given roles and duties to fulfill on behalf of the master. The "servants" can represent the community of believers or those under the care of the leader, highlighting the responsibility to lead with integrity and care.<p><b>to give them their portion</b><br>This phrase indicates the duty of the manager to provide for the needs of the servants. It underscores the biblical theme of provision and care, where leaders are expected to ensure that those under their charge receive what is necessary for their well-being. This can be seen as both physical and spiritual nourishment, aligning with the broader scriptural mandate to care for others.<p><b>at the proper time</b><br>Timing is crucial in biblical teachings, reflecting God's perfect plan and order. The "proper time" suggests discernment and wisdom in knowing when to act, aligning with God's timing rather than human impatience. This echoes other scriptural references to God's timing, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, teaching His disciples about readiness and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_and_wise_manager.htm">The Faithful and Wise Manager</a></b><br>Represents those entrusted with responsibilities in God's kingdom, expected to be diligent and prudent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with duties and will return to assess their faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Those under the care of the manager, representing believers or members of the church community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_portion_of_food.htm">The Portion of Food</a></b><br>Symbolizes the spiritual and practical needs that the manager is responsible for distributing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_stewardship.htm">Faithfulness in Stewardship</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be faithful stewards of the resources, talents, and responsibilities God has entrusted to us.

Here the words come as an answer to Peter's question. The promise was spoken, not for the Twelve only, but for every faithful and wise steward. The words are as the germ of the parable which sets forth the wisdom, though not the faithfulness, of the Unjust Steward (<a href="/context/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8-10</a>). If wisdom and prudence alone deserved the praise there bestowed on it, what would be due to wisdom and faithfulness united? In St. Paul's words, "It is required in stewards that a man be found faithful" (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1Corinthians 4:2</a>), we may, perhaps, recognise one of the many traces left on his Epistles by the companionship of St. Luke.

"Who then," asks the Lord, "is that faithful and wise steward, whom <span class="accented">his</span> lord shall make ruler ever his household?" Who? Peter must answer the question. <span class="accented">This</span> steward should be Peter himself and each of Peter's chosen companions. <span class="accented">This</span> high position of steward in the household of the Lord should be filled by those whom Jesus had specially chosen. If, when he came again, the Lord found <span class="accented">these</span> faithful to their solemn trust, then <span class="accented">these</span> should receive a still higher and grander recompense even than that inconceivably splendid reward (mentioned in ver. 37) which had so struck Peter; and the higher recompense which these, the faithful and wise stewards, should then receive would be <span class="accented">the being made rulers over all that the Lord hath.</span> The answer of the Master then told Peter that all his followers, if found true and loyal, should receive the reward promised (in ver. 37) to the watching servants, who in the world to come would be not the <span class="accented">servants</span> but the <span class="accented">friends</span> of God. While the <span class="accented">few</span>, the chosen apostles of the Lord, if <span class="accented">they</span> endured to the end, if <span class="accented">they</span> were found wise and faithful, to them would be given in the new life a yet more glorious recompense; they would be set in some special position of government and dominion in the glorious city of God. This teaches, too, indirectly, but with great clearness, that in the heaven-life <span class="accented">all</span> Christ's redeemed will enjoy in the friendship of God a perfect blessedness. Still, in that perfect blessedness which will be the heritage of all the redeemed, there will still be degrees in glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
