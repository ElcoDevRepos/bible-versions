It suggests a divine appointment, highlighting Jesus' authority and power to act in the present moment. This immediacy is a recurring theme in the Gospels, demonstrating Jesus' responsiveness to human need.<p><b>Jesus healed many people of their diseases</b><br>The act of healing is central to Jesus' ministry, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our sicknesses. Healing was a sign of the Kingdom of God breaking into the world, showcasing Jesus' compassion and divine authority. The term "diseases" covers a wide range of physical ailments, reflecting the brokenness of the world and the comprehensive nature of Jesus' restorative power.<p><b>afflictions</b><br>Afflictions can refer to both physical and mental suffering. In the cultural context of the time, illness was often seen as a result of sin or demonic influence. Jesus' healing of afflictions demonstrates His power over both the physical and spiritual realms, challenging contemporary beliefs and showcasing His role as the ultimate healer.<p><b>and evil spirits</b><br>Casting out evil spirits was a significant aspect of Jesus' ministry, illustrating His authority over the spiritual realm. This act fulfilled prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of setting captives free. It also prefigures the ultimate defeat of Satan and his forces, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>. Jesus' exorcisms were a direct confrontation with the powers of darkness, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>and He gave sight to many who were blind</b><br>Restoring sight to the blind is a powerful symbol of spiritual enlightenment and salvation. In the Old Testament, blindness often symbolized spiritual ignorance or judgment (<a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). Jesus' miracles of giving sight not only fulfilled messianic prophecies (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>) but also pointed to His mission to bring spiritual light to a darkened world. This act is a type of the greater spiritual awakening that Jesus offers to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing miraculous healings and demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afflicted.htm">The Afflicted</a></b><br>Individuals suffering from various diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, representing the brokenness of humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind.htm">The Blind</a></b><br>Those who were physically blind, symbolizing both physical and spiritual blindness that Jesus came to heal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hour.htm">The Hour</a></b><br>A specific moment in time when Jesus' miraculous works were evident, emphasizing the immediacy and power of His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_compassion_of_christ.htm">The Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' healing acts demonstrate His deep compassion for human suffering.

They were sent to ask whether Jesus is &#8220;the One who was to come.&#8221; The instant display of power is a living answer.<p>- Similar &#8220;now&#8221; moments appear in <a href="/luke/5-25.htm">Luke 5:25</a> (&#8220;Immediately he rose up before them&#8221;) and <a href="/mark/5-29.htm">Mark 5:29</a>, underscoring that Christ&#8217;s authority operates in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus healed many people</b><p>- The word &#8220;many&#8221; points to abundance, not selectivity.
