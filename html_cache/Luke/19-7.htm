The grumbling reflects a common response to Jesus' ministry, where He often challenged societal norms and religious expectations. The crowd's reaction is reminiscent of the Israelites' murmuring in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>), indicating a lack of understanding or acceptance of God's ways. This grumbling also underscores the tension between Jesus' message of grace and the prevailing legalistic mindset.<p><b>saying, &#8220;He has gone to be the guest</b><br>In the cultural context of first-century Judea, sharing a meal or being a guest in someone's home was a sign of acceptance and fellowship. By choosing to be the guest of Zacchaeus, Jesus demonstrates His mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). This act of fellowship with a tax collector, considered a traitor and sinner by Jewish society, illustrates the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry and foreshadows the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>of a sinful man!&#8221;</b><br>Zacchaeus, as a chief tax collector, was viewed as a sinner due to his association with the Roman occupiers and his likely exploitation of his fellow Jews. The label "sinful man" reflects the societal judgment and exclusion he faced. Jesus' willingness to associate with Zacchaeus challenges the prevailing religious attitudes and highlights the transformative power of grace.

Jesus, however, intentionally seeks out the sinner, entering his home and offering fellowship that leads to repentance and salvation.

The chief publican was clearly not popular, and probably the priestly tone of the place (see Note on <a href="/luke/19-5.htm" title="And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your house.">Luke 19:5</a>) gave additional strength to all caste feelings.
