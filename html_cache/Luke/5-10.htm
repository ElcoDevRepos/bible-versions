This partnership highlights the communal nature of fishing in the Sea of Galilee, where family businesses were common. James and John would later become prominent figures among the apostles, with John being the beloved disciple and author of several New Testament books. Their inclusion here emphasizes the calling of ordinary men to extraordinary purposes. The mention of Zebedee indicates a family business, and Zebedee's presence in the Gospels suggests a man of some means, as he had hired servants (<a href="/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; Jesus said to Simon.</b><br>Jesus' command to "not be afraid" is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, often spoken by God or His messengers to reassure individuals facing divine encounters or daunting tasks. This phrase signifies a transition from fear to faith, a necessary step for Simon Peter as he embarks on his new mission. The reassurance is personal and direct, indicating Jesus' understanding of human apprehension and His role as a comforter. This moment foreshadows Peter's future leadership role and the courage he will need to fulfill it.<p><b>&#8220;From now on you will catch men.&#8221;</b><br>This metaphorical statement marks the transformation of Simon Peter's vocation from a fisherman to a "fisher of men," symbolizing the evangelistic mission of the apostles. The imagery of catching men suggests the gathering of people into the kingdom of God, a task that requires skill, patience, and perseverance, much like fishing. This calling is prophetic, pointing to the future growth of the early church and Peter's pivotal role in it, as seen in the book of Acts. The phrase also connects to Old Testament prophecies about the gathering of God's people (<a href="/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>) and highlights the redemptive mission of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>A fisherman by trade, Simon Peter is called by Jesus to become a "fisher of men."

And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.">Luke 5:7</a>; that expressing that they were sharers in the work, this a more general partnership in business, as in <a href="/philemon/1-17.htm" title="If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.">Philemon 1:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt catch men.</span>--This is St. Luke's equivalent for the "I will make you fishers of men" in St. Matthew and St. Mark. The word implies that what is caught is taken alive. The only other passage in which it occurs in the New Testament is <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm" title="And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.">2Timothy 2:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear not</span>. A feeling of intense overpowering awe on a sudden came on Simon after listening to the words and seeing this last act of power which so closely affected him. The very fish of his native lake, then, were subject to this strange holy Man! This was no mortal, thought the fisherman, and he fell at the Master's feet. "Finding as it does its parallel in almost all manifestations of a Divine or even an angelic presence, it (this awful fear) must be owned to contain a mighty, because an instructive, witness for the sinfulness of man's nature, out of which it comes to pass that any near revelation from the heavenly world fills the children of men, even the holiest among them, with terror and amazement, yea, sometimes with the expectation of death itself" (Archbishop Trench, 'Introduction to the Epistles to the Seven Churches'). The same "Fear not" ("Be not afraid") was uttered on like occasions to Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a>), to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>), and several times during the earthly ministry was said to the disciples, and for the last time the reassuring words were spoken by the Redeemer after the Ascension to his own dear follower, John, who could not bear the sight of the glorious majesty of his risen Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">shalt catch men</span>. The imagery contained in these words of the Master to his fishermen-followers was, of course, drawn from the late scene. Their failure in catching fish, their Teacher's marvellous success, the net bursting with the great catch of silvery fish; the Lord's strange prophetic words which accompanied their call to his service, - all would in after-years often come up before the disciples in their hours of alternating failure and success in the mighty task he had set them to do. The great Fisherman, Christ; his imitators and servants, fishers; the world of men pictured as fish, - were ever favourite images for the pencil, the graving tool, and the pen of the Christian artist and writer of the first ages of the faith. One of the earliest extant hymns, for instance, of the Church, by Clement of Alexandria, dwells on the image. The words are addressed to Christ - <p><span class="accented">"Fisher of men, the blest,<br />Out of the world's unrest,<br />Out of sin's troubled sea,<br />Taking us, Lord, to thee</span>; <p><span class="accented">Out of the waves of strife<br />With bait of blissful life;<br />Drawing thy nets to shore,<br />With choicest fish, good store."</span><br /><br />(Hymn of Clement of Alexandria.) The favourite Christian monogram of the fish, carved on so many tombs in the Catacombs, belongs to the same imagery - the <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so [were]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(homoi&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3668.htm">Strong's 3668: </a> </span><span class="str2">In like manner, similarly, in the same way, equally.
