In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord coming upon someone often indicated a special calling or mission (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This anointing is a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which prophesied the coming of the Messiah who would be empowered by the Spirit. The presence of the Holy Spirit marks Jesus as the chosen one, set apart for a divine purpose.<p><b>because He has anointed Me</b><br>Anointing in biblical times was a symbolic act of consecration, often involving oil, signifying being set apart for a specific role or task (e.g., priests, kings). Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah (Hebrew: Mashiach, Greek: Christos), fulfilling the messianic prophecies. This anointing is not with oil but with the Holy Spirit, indicating a spiritual mission and authority.<p><b>to preach good news to the poor</b><br>The "good news" or "gospel" is the message of salvation and the coming of God's kingdom. The poor, in this context, can refer to those who are economically disadvantaged, but also to the spiritually poor or humble (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). Jesus' ministry focused on those marginalized by society, offering hope and redemption. This aligns with the prophetic tradition of caring for the poor and oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>).<p><b>He has sent Me to proclaim liberty to the captives</b><br>This phrase echoes the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), a time when debts were forgiven, and slaves were freed. Jesus' mission includes spiritual liberation from sin and bondage (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>). The captives can be seen as those bound by sin, demonic oppression, or societal injustices. This proclamation is a central theme of Jesus' ministry, offering freedom and restoration.<p><b>and recovery of sight to the blind</b><br>While Jesus performed physical healings, restoring sight to the blind (e.g., <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-7</a>), this phrase also symbolizes spiritual enlightenment. Blindness in scripture often represents a lack of understanding or spiritual insight (<a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). Jesus brings light to those in darkness, revealing truth and guiding them to salvation.<p><b>to release the oppressed</b><br>The oppressed are those burdened by sin, societal structures, or spiritual forces. Jesus' mission is to bring relief and deliverance, fulfilling the messianic prophecy of setting the oppressed free (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>). This release is both physical and spiritual, offering a holistic salvation that addresses the needs of the whole person. Jesus' ministry consistently challenged oppressive systems and offered hope to those suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking in the synagogue in Nazareth, declaring His mission and fulfilling the prophecy from Isaiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord.htm">The Spirit of the Lord</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who empowers and anoints Jesus for His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The town where Jesus grew up and where this event takes place.

The words "to heal the broken-hearted" are not in the best MSS. "To set at liberty them that are bruised" is not found in the present text of Isaiah. It is a legitimate inference that the passage which Jesus thus read was one in which He wished men to see the leading idea of His ministry. Glad tidings for the poor, remission of sins, comfort for the mourners, these were what He proclaimed now. These were proclaimed again in the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount. We cannot fail to connect the opening words with the descent of the Spirit at His baptism. That was the "unction from the Holy One" (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1John 2:20</a>) which made Him the Christ, the true anointed of the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Recovering of sight to the blind.</span>--The English version of Isaiah rightly follows the Hebrew in giving "the opening of the prison to them that are bound." The blindness is that of those who have been imprisoned in the darkness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me</span>. St. Luke here quotes, with a few important variations, from the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1, 2</a>. The clause, "to set at liberty them that are bruised," does not occur the present text of Isaiah. The bright, comforting words of the great prophet the Lord chose as giving a general summary of what he designed to carry out in his ministry. It could be no undesigned coincidence that the opening words of the passage contain a singularly clear mention of the three Persons of the blessed Trinity - the Spirit, the Father, and the Anointed (Messiah). <span class="cmt_word">Because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor</span>, etc. The common interpretation referred this passage to the state of the people on the return from the Captivity. Nothing, however, that the people had yet experienced in any way satisfied the brilliant picture painted in the great prophecy. A remnant certainly had returned several centuries back from their distant exile, but the large majority of the chosen people were scattered abroad; their own land was crushed under what seemed a hopeless servitude; poverty, ignorance, universal discontent, reigned alike in Jerusalem, garrisoned with Roman legionaries, and in the most distant of the poor upland villages of Galilee. Only could deliverance come and a golden age of prosperity return with the promised Messiah. This was the interpretation which the choicest spirits in Israel applied to the great Isaiah prophecy read that sabbath day in the little synagogue of Nazareth. This was the meaning which Jesus at once gave to it, only he startled his hearers by telling them that in him they saw the promised long-looked-for Deliverer. We only possess, it is evident, the very barest abstract of the words of the Teacher Jesus on this occasion. They must have been singularly eloquent, winning, and powerful to have extorted the wonder and admiration alluded to in the twenty-second verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;[The] Spirit</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Pneuma)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4151.htm">Strong's 4151: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, spirit. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of [the] Lord [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyriou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
