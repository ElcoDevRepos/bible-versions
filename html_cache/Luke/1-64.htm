Zechariah had been rendered mute as a sign of his disbelief when Gabriel announced the birth of his son, John the Baptist. The immediate opening of his mouth signifies the divine intervention and the completion of God's promise. This moment underscores the theme of God's faithfulness and the importance of belief in His word. The suddenness of the event highlights the miraculous nature of God's actions.<p><b>and his tongue was released</b><br>The release of Zechariah's tongue symbolizes the restoration of his ability to communicate, both physically and spiritually. In biblical times, speech was often associated with one's ability to proclaim God's works and participate in communal worship. The loosening of his tongue can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual liberation and the power of God to restore and heal. This act also signifies the removal of any barriers between Zechariah and his role in God's plan, allowing him to fulfill his prophetic duty.<p><b>and he began to speak</b><br>Zechariah's first act upon regaining his speech is to speak, which indicates the importance of verbal expression in the biblical narrative. Speaking is a form of testimony and witness, and Zechariah's words would have held significant weight as a priest and a father of a prophesied child. This moment connects to the broader biblical theme of the power of the spoken word, as seen in creation (Genesis 1) and the prophetic declarations throughout Scripture.<p><b>praising God</b><br>Zechariah's immediate response is one of praise, reflecting a heart transformed by the experience of God's miraculous work. This act of worship aligns with the biblical principle that true encounters with God lead to praise and adoration. His praise can be seen as a fulfillment of the purpose of humanity, which is to glorify God. This moment also prefigures the role of John the Baptist, who would later call people to repentance and point them to Christ, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and praising God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest of the division of Abijah, husband to Elizabeth, and father of John the Baptist.

No lag time&#8212;obedience opened the door to blessing just as quickly as unbelief had brought silence (<a href="/luke/1-18.htm">Luke 1:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>- Cross references highlight how God often acts &#8220;straightaway&#8221; once His conditions are met, such as the leper&#8217;s cleansing in <a href="/mark/1-42.htm">Mark 1:42</a> or the jailer&#8217;s salvation in <a href="/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zechariah&#8217;s mouth was opened</b><p>- Nine months earlier the angel declared, &#8220;You will be silent...until the day these things take place&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>). That sentence ends here. The opening of Zechariah&#8217;s mouth proves the angel&#8217;s words true to the letter.<p>- It also mirrors <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>, where the prophet&#8217;s mouth was opened only after God fulfilled His warning&#8212;reminding us that the Lord both disciplines and restores.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his tongue was released</b><p>- The picture is of a physical restraint loosened.
