The act of throwing the son out of the vineyard and killing him signifies the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ outside the city of Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). This reflects the historical treatment of prophets in Israel, as many were rejected and killed (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). The vineyard imagery is rooted in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard that fails to produce good fruit. The rejection of the son is a direct prophecy of Jesus' own rejection by the Jewish leaders, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, where the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone.<p><b>What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</b><br>This rhetorical question anticipates divine judgment. The owner of the vineyard represents God, who will hold the tenants accountable for their actions. This reflects the biblical principle of divine justice, where God will ultimately judge those who reject His messengers and His Son (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>). The question underscores the certainty of judgment and the seriousness of rejecting God's provision and authority. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of stewardship and accountability, as seen in parables like the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). The anticipated judgment foreshadows the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, a historical event seen as a consequence of Israel's rejection of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals responsible for caring for the vineyard.

Yet even in judgment the Lord advances His redemptive plan, transferring the blessings of His &#8220;vineyard&#8221; to all who believe.
