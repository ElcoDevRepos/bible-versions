Situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, it was a bustling fishing village and a center for trade and commerce. Archaeological excavations have uncovered a synagogue and other structures from the time of Jesus, providing insight into the daily life and religious practices of the inhabitants. The phrase "went down" indicates a descent in elevation from Nazareth to Capernaum, reflecting the geographical reality of the region.<p><b>a town in Galilee</b><br>Galilee was a fertile region in northern Israel, known for its diverse population and cultural influences due to its proximity to Gentile territories. This area was often looked down upon by Judeans, yet it played a crucial role in Jesus' ministry. Galilee's mixed population fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee of the Gentiles, pointing to the Messiah's outreach to all nations.<p><b>and on the Sabbath He began to teach the people</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest and worship, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, as commanded in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). Synagogues served as places for teaching and community gatherings, where the Scriptures were read and expounded. Jesus' teaching on the Sabbath highlights His role as a rabbi and His authority in interpreting the Scriptures. His practice of teaching on the Sabbath is consistent with His mission to fulfill the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), and it often led to confrontations with religious leaders, as He challenged their interpretations and traditions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is beginning His ministry and teaching with authority in Capernaum.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles and taught in the synagogue.

Capernaum was the real home of the Master during the two years and a half of his public ministry. He chose this flourishing lakecity partly because his kinsmen and first disciples lived in it or its immediate neighborhood, but more especially on account of its situation. It has been termed the very center of the manufacturing district of Palestine; it lay on the high-road which led from Damascus and the Syrian cities to Tyro, Sidon, and Jerusalem. "It was, in fact, on 'the way of the sea' (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>), the great caravan-road which led (from the East) to the Mediterranean. It was hence peculiarly fitted to be the center of a far-reaching ministry, of which even Gentiles would hear" (Farrar). The evangelist speaks of "coming down" to the shore of the lake, in contrast with Nazareth, which was placed in the hills. We do not meet with the name Capernaum in the Old Testament; it therefore appears not to have been a city belonging to remote antiquity. Its name is generally interpreted as being compounded of two words, signifying "town of consolations," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - a beautiful and significant derivation. It may, however, originally have taken its name from the Prophet Nahum. Josephus, the historian, tells us. the name originally belonged to a fountain. He dwells also on the mildness of the climate; it would therefore seem as though, in the first place, Capernaum was used as a health resort, and then its admirable situation favored its adoption as a convenient center. The extensive ruins of <span class="accented">Tel-Hum</span>, on the lake-shore, are generally believed to be the remains of the once rich and populous Capernaum. <span class="cmt_word">And taught them on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kat&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2718.htm">Strong's 2718: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and erchomai; to come down.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Capernaum,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#961;&#957;&#945;&#959;&#8058;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Kapharnaoum)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2584.htm">Strong's 2584: </a> </span><span class="str2">Capernaum, a town of Galilee.
