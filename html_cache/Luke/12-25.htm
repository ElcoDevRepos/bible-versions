In the biblical context, worry is often seen as a lack of trust in God's provision and sovereignty. Jesus frequently taught about the futility of worry, emphasizing reliance on God (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>). The cultural context of the time involved daily concerns about food, clothing, and shelter, which were more immediate and pressing than in many modern societies. Jesus' audience would have understood worry as a natural response to these challenges, yet He calls them to a higher trust in God.<p><b>can add a single hour</b><br>The phrase highlights the limitations of human control over life. In the original Greek, the word translated as "hour" can also mean "cubit," a measure of length, suggesting the futility of trying to extend one's life or stature through worry. This reflects the biblical theme that life and its duration are in God's hands (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>). The historical context shows that life expectancy was much shorter in ancient times, making the desire to extend life even more poignant.<p><b>to his life?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the point that worry is ineffective in altering the course of one's life. The Bible consistently teaches that God is the author of life and that He alone determines its length (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>). This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of trusting God with one's life and future, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. It also points to the ultimate hope in Christ, who offers eternal life beyond the temporal concerns of this world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd about the futility of worry and the importance of trusting in God's provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, they are learning about faith and reliance on God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A larger group of people who are also listening to Jesus' teachings, representing a broader audience beyond the immediate circle of disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_worry.htm">The Futility of Worry</a></b><br>Worrying does not change our circumstances or extend our lives.

Since the Lord alone numbers our days, we are freed to seek His kingdom, live joyfully in the present, and rest in the certainty that every moment is already held in His wise, loving hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
