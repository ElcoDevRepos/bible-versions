In the context of first-century Jewish culture, growth and strength were essential for a child, especially a male, who would be expected to learn a trade and contribute to the family. This growth is not only physical but also spiritual and intellectual, indicating a balanced development. The mention of strength can also be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies concerning the Messiah, who would be a strong leader for His people. This growth parallels the description of other biblical figures like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>), who also grew in stature and favor with the Lord.<p><b>He was filled with wisdom,</b><br>Wisdom in the Jewish tradition is highly valued, often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Jesus being filled with wisdom indicates His deep understanding and insight, even from a young age. This wisdom is not merely intellectual but also moral and spiritual, aligning with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament. It foreshadows His later teachings and parables, which would astonish many with their depth and authority (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>). The wisdom of Jesus is a fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of wisdom resting upon the Messiah.<p><b>and the grace of God was upon Him.</b><br>The grace of God signifies divine favor and blessing. In the Old Testament, God's grace is often associated with His covenantal faithfulness and mercy. For Jesus, this grace indicates His unique relationship with the Father, marked by divine approval and empowerment for His mission. This grace is evident in His life and ministry, as He performs miracles, teaches with authority, and ultimately provides salvation. The phrase also connects to the concept of Jesus as the embodiment of grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), highlighting His role in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child (Jesus)</a></b><br>This verse refers to Jesus Christ during His childhood.

His ordinary-yet-extraordinary childhood sets the stage for a ministry grounded in perfect humanity and divine approval, inviting us to trust Him as the fully sufficient Savior who understands every stage of our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">Waxed strong in spirit.</span>--The better MSS. omit the last two words.<p><span class= "bld">Filled with wisdom.</span>--The Greek participle implies the continuous process of "being filled," and so conveys the thought expressed in <a href="/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>, of an increase of wisdom. The soul of Jesus was human, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>subject to the conditions and limitations of human knowledge, and learnt as others learn. The heresy of Apollinarius, who constructed a theory of the Incarnation on the assumption that the Divine Word (the <span class= "ital">Logos </span>of St. John's Gospel) took, in our Lord's humanity, the place of the human mind or intellect, is thus, as it were, anticipated and condemned.<p><span class= "bld">The grace of God was upon him.</span>--The words seem chosen to express a different thought from that used to describe the growth of the Baptist. Here there was more than guidance, more than strength, a manifest outflowing of the divine favour in the moral beauty of a perfectly holy childhood.<p>On the history of the period between this and the next verses, see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>in the Notes on Matthew 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him</span>. Another of this evangelist's solemn pauses in his narrative. In this short statement the story of twelve quiet years is told. From these few words St. Luke evidently understands the humanity of Jesus as a reality. The statement that "he waxed strong, filled with wisdom" (the words, "in spirit," do not occur in the older authorities), tells us that, in the teaching of SS. Paul and Luke, the Boy learnt as others learnt, subject to the ordinary growth and development of human knowledge; thus condemning, as it were, by anticipation, the strange heresy of Apollinarius, who taught that the Divine Word (the Logos) took, in our Lord's humanity, the place of the human mind or intellect. <span class="accented">And the grace of God was upon him</span>. The legendary apocryphal Gospels are rich in stories of the Child Jesus' doings during these many years. But the silence of the holy four, whose testimony has been received now since the last years of the first century by the whole Church, is our authority for assuming that no work of power was done, and probably that no word of teaching was spoken, until the public ministry commenced, when the Messiah had reached his thirtieth year. "Take notice here," wrote Bonaventura, quoted by Farrar, "that his doing nothing wonderful was itself a kind of wonder.... As there was power in his actions, so is there power in his silence, in his inactivity, in his retirement." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(To)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
