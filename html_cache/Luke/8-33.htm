The man, previously possessed, is now freed, demonstrating Jesus' power to liberate individuals from spiritual bondage. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who sets the captives free. The deliverance also signifies the breaking of spiritual chains, a type of the greater deliverance from sin that Jesus offers to all humanity.<p><b>and went into the pigs,</b><br>The transfer of demons into pigs is significant, as pigs were considered unclean animals according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). This event took place in the region of the Gerasenes, a predominantly Gentile area, which explains the presence of a large herd of pigs. The choice of pigs underscores the unclean nature of the demons and serves as a visual representation of their impurity. This act also demonstrates the destructive intent of demonic forces, as they seek to destroy whatever they inhabit.<p><b>and the herd rushed down the steep bank</b><br>The steep bank indicates the geographical setting, likely near the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, where such terrain is common. The sudden and violent movement of the herd illustrates the chaotic and destructive power of the demons. This scene serves as a warning of the potential havoc that evil can wreak when it is not restrained by divine authority.<p><b>into the lake and was drowned.</b><br>The drowning of the pigs in the lake symbolizes the ultimate defeat and destruction of evil. Water, often a symbol of chaos and judgment in the Bible (as seen in the story of Noah's flood), here becomes the means by which the demonic presence is eradicated. This act prefigures the final judgment when all evil will be cast into the lake of fire (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).
