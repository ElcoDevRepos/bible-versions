In this context, it is part of the temptation of Jesus by Satan, who quotes Scripture to persuade Jesus. The phrase underscores the authority and importance of Scripture in Jewish and early Christian thought. It reflects the practice of using the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) as a foundation for teaching and decision-making.<p><b>&#8216;He will command His angels concerning You</b><br>This part of the verse is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, which speaks of God's protection over His faithful. The use of angels signifies divine intervention and care, a common theme in Jewish theology. Angels are often seen as messengers and protectors, acting on God's behalf. This reflects the belief in a spiritual realm actively involved in the affairs of humanity.<p><b>to guard You carefully,</b><br>The promise of protection is emphasized here, suggesting a vigilant and attentive safeguarding by the angels. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence and care for His people. The careful guarding implies not just physical protection but also spiritual and moral guidance. This connects to the broader narrative of Jesus' mission, where divine protection is assured but not to be tested presumptuously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by Satan in the wilderness after fasting for forty days and nights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary who tempts Jesus, attempting to lead Him into sin by misusing Scripture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desolate place where Jesus is led by the Spirit and where the temptation occurs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings mentioned in the verse, who are commanded by God to protect and serve His purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the temptation account includes the setting of the pinnacle of the temple in Jerusalem, where Satan challenges Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_scripture_in_context.htm">Understanding Scripture in Context</a></b><br>Satan uses Scripture out of context to tempt Jesus.
