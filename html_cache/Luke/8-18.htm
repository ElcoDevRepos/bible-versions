In the biblical context, Jesus often spoke in parables, which required careful attention and a heart open to understanding. The cultural context of the time valued oral tradition, making listening a crucial skill. This call to attentive listening is echoed in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, which advises believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak."<p><b>Whoever has will be given more,</b><br>This principle reflects the spiritual law of growth and abundance. In the context of Jesus' teachings, it suggests that those who are receptive and faithful with the spiritual insights and gifts they have will receive even greater understanding and blessings. This idea is paralleled in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful servants are rewarded with more responsibility and joy.<p><b>but whoever does not have,</b><br>This phrase warns of the consequences of spiritual neglect or indifference. It implies a lack of genuine engagement with the truth. In the historical context, many religious leaders of the time had access to the Scriptures but failed to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, illustrating a lack of true spiritual possession.<p><b>even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.&#8221;</b><br>This serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers of self-deception and complacency. It suggests that superficial or assumed spiritual knowledge can be lost if not genuinely possessed and nurtured. This concept is seen in the warnings to the churches in Revelation, where Jesus cautions against losing one's lampstand (<a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>). It underscores the necessity of a sincere and active faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd about the importance of listening and responding to His words.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, they are being instructed on how to understand and apply His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of people who often followed Jesus, listening to His parables and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_attentive_listening.htm">The Importance of Attentive Listening</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need to listen carefully to His teachings.
