His question is rhetorical, designed to challenge their understanding of the Sabbath. The context is a dinner at the house of a prominent Pharisee, where Jesus had just healed a man with dropsy. This setting is significant as it highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over the interpretation of the law.<p><b>&#8220;Which of you whose son or ox falls into a pit</b><br>The mention of a "son" or "ox" falling into a pit draws on common experiences of the time. Livestock was a valuable asset, and family members were of utmost importance. The pit represents unforeseen danger or need, and the scenario is relatable to the audience. This phrase echoes the practical concerns of daily life in ancient Israel, where such incidents could occur frequently.<p><b>on the Sabbath day</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest, commanded by God in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). The Pharisees had developed extensive rules about what constituted work on the Sabbath, often leading to legalistic interpretations. Jesus frequently challenged these interpretations, emphasizing the spirit of the law over the letter. The Sabbath was meant for rest and worship, but Jesus highlights that mercy and necessity should not be neglected.<p><b>will not immediately pull him out?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores the principle of mercy over ritual. Jesus points out the inconsistency in the Pharisees' application of the law. If they would rescue an animal or a family member on the Sabbath, how much more should they care for a person in need? This aligns with Jesus' teaching that "the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>). The immediacy of the action&#8212;"immediately pull him out"&#8212;emphasizes the urgency and priority of compassion over strict Sabbath observance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching and challenging the Pharisees' understanding of the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>- A religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law, often in conflict with Jesus over interpretations of the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>- A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_or_ox.htm">Son or Ox</a></b><br>- Used in Jesus' rhetorical question to illustrate the necessity and compassion that should override strict Sabbath observance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pit.htm">Pit</a></b><br>- Represents a situation of immediate need or danger, used metaphorically to discuss the urgency of compassionate action.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_legalism.htm">Compassion Over Legalism</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that compassion should take precedence over strict legalistic interpretations of the Law.

Instead of launching into a lecture, He opens with a question.<p>&#8226; Questions expose motives, much like the Lord&#8217;s inquiries in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> and <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>.<p>&#8226; By inviting His listeners to reason, He shows that obedience is never blind legalism but heart-level agreement with God&#8217;s character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which of you</b><p>&#8211; The Lord places every hearer inside the illustration.<p>&#8226; Each man must picture himself acting, not merely judging others (<a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; This personal angle removes any safe distance the Pharisees might feel, just as Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; did for David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whose son or ox falls into a pit</b><p>&#8211; Jesus selects two precious investments: family and livelihood.<p>&#8226; A &#8220;son&#8221; highlights relational love; an &#8220;ox&#8221; underscores economic necessity (<a href="/proverbs/14-4.htm">Proverbs 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The pit evokes sudden crisis (<a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33-34</a>). Something valuable is in genuine danger, not trivial inconvenience.<p>&#8226; The pairing shows the Law already allowed mercy toward animals (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-4.htm">Deuteronomy 22:4</a>); surely it also honors mercy toward people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the Sabbath day</b><p>&#8211; This is the crux. The Fourth Commandment stands (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), yet the Pharisees&#8217; added rules had eclipsed its intent.<p>&#8226; Jesus consistently teaches that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Acts of necessity and mercy never violate God&#8217;s rest; they fulfill it. David&#8217;s eating of the consecrated bread (<a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>; referenced in <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a>) illustrates the same principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will not immediately pull him out?</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Immediately&#8221; shows urgency and instinctive compassion.<p>&#8226; No decent father hesitates; no rancher delays&#8212;neither does God (<a href="/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By their own behavior the religious leaders admit that mercy outranks ritual when the two appear to clash (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, echoed in <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore healing a suffering man on the Sabbath is perfectly aligned with the heart of the Lawgiver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/14-5.htm">Luke 14:5</a> teaches that Sabbath observance is never meant to stifle compassion. Using a relatable rescue scenario, Jesus proves that even strict religionists practice mercy when something they value is endangered. If it is right to save an animal or child on the Sabbath, it is unquestionably right for the Son of God to heal a suffering person. The verse exposes hypocrisy, defends Sabbath kindness, and affirms that love is the true fulfillment of God&#8217;s law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Which of you shall have an ass or an ox . . .</span>--The line of thought is all but identical with that of <a href="/luke/13-15.htm" title="The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?">Luke 13:15</a>. Here, as there, the outward features of Jewish life are the same as they had been in <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm" title="The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.">Isaiah 1:3</a>. The "ox and the ass" are the beasts which common men use and value. The horse belongs to conquerors and kings. This is said with reference to the received text. Many of the best MSS., however, read, "Which of you shall have a <span class= "ital">son,</span> or an ox . . .?" and, on the whole, this reading seems likely to be the true one. The familiar combination of the ox and the ass would naturally lead a transcriber to substitute <span class= "greekheb">????</span> (ass) for <span class= "greekheb">???? </span>(son). There would be nothing to tempt any one to a change in the opposite direction.<p><span class= "bld">Fallen into a pit.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">into a well,</span> as in <a href="/context/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6-11</a>, but the word was applied also, as in <a href="/context/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1-2</a>, to "wells without water"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as here, to "pits." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And answered them, saying,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> Most of the older authorities here, instead of" an ass or an ox," read "a son or an ox." The difference here in the reading without doubt arises from the perplexity which was felt in very early days over the strangeness of the collocation of "a son and an ox." This is the reading, however, which, according to all the acknowledged principles of criticism, we must consider the true one. The meaning is clear. "If thy son, or even, to take a very different comparison, thy ox, were to fall into a pit, wouldn't you," etc.? How the sophistries of the scribes and the perplexing traditions of the Jerusalem rabbis on their sabbath restrictions must have been torn asunder by the act of mercy and power performed, and the words of Divine wisdom spoken by the Physician-Teacher of Galilee! The noble instincts even of the jealous Pharisees must have been for a moment stirred. Even they, at times, rose above the dreary, lightless teaching with which the rabbinical schools had so marred the old Divine Law. Dr. Farrar quotes a traditional instance of this. "When Hillel" - afterwards the great rabbi and head of the famous school which bore his name - "then a poor porter, had been found half-frozen under masses of snow in the window of the lecture-room of Shemaiah and Abtation, where he had hidden himself, to profit by their wisdom, because he had been unable to earn the small fee for entrance, they had rubbed and resuscitated him, <span class="accented">though it was the sabbath day</span>, and had said that he was one for whose sake it was well worth while to break the sabbath." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He asked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
