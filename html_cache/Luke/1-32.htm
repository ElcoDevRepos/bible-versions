In biblical terms, "great" often signifies not only physical or social stature but also spiritual and moral excellence. Jesus' greatness is affirmed throughout the Gospels, as He performs miracles, teaches with authority, and fulfills Old Testament prophecies. His greatness is not just in His deeds but in His divine nature and mission to bring salvation to humanity.<p><b>and will be called the Son of the Most High.</b><br>"Son of the Most High" is a title that underscores Jesus' divine origin and unique relationship with God. The term "Most High" is used throughout the Old Testament to refer to God, highlighting His supreme authority and power (e.g., <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>). This title indicates Jesus' divine sonship, setting Him apart from all other prophets and leaders. It also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the coming Messiah is described with divine titles.<p><b>The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David,</b><br>This phrase connects Jesus to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jesus, as a descendant of David, fulfills this promise, establishing His rightful place as the eternal King. This connection to David is crucial for understanding Jesus' role as the Messiah, who is both a spiritual and a royal leader. The throne of David symbolizes not just political authority but also the fulfillment of God's promises to His people, pointing to a kingdom that is everlasting and divine in nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, prophesied to be great and called the Son of the Most High.

I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.">Mark 5:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The throne of his father David.</span>--The words seem at first to suggest the thought that the Virgin was of the house of David, and that the title to the throne was thus derived through her. This may have been so (see Note on <a href="/context/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23-38</a>), and the intermarriage which had taken place in olden times between the house of Aaron and that of David (<a href="/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm" title="But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.">2Kings 11:2</a>) show that this might be quite consistent with the relationship to Elizabeth mentioned in <a href="/luke/1-36.htm" title="And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.">Luke 1:36</a>. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the genealogies, both in St. Matthew and St. Luke, appear, at first sight, to give the lineage of Joseph only, and therefore that, if this were, as many have believed, the Evangelist's point of view, our Lord, notwithstanding the supernatural birth, was thought of as inheriting from him. The form of the promise, which might well lead to the expectation of a revived kingdom of Israel after the manner of that of David, takes its place among the most memorable instances of prophecies that have been fulfilled in quite another fashion than those who first heard them could have imagined possible. That the Evangelist who recorded it held that it was fulfilled in the Kingdom of Heaven, the spiritual sovereignty of the Christ, is shown by the fact that he records it in the same Gospel as that which tells of the Crucifixion and Ascension. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Son of the Highest</span>. It is singular that this title, given by the angel to the yet unborn child, was the one given to the Redeemer by the evil spirit in the case of the poor possessed (see <a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>). Is this the title, or one of the titles, by which our Master is known in that greater world beyond our knowledge? <span class="cmt_word">The throne of his father David</span>; clearly indicating that Mary herself was of royal lineage, although this is nowhere definitely stated (see <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>). These words of the angel are as yet unfulfilled. They clearly speak of a restoration of Israel, still, as far as we can see, very distant. Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since Gabriel spoke of a restored throne of David, of a kingdom in Jacob to which should come no end. The people, through all the changing fortune of empires, have been indeed strangely kept distinct and separate, ready for the mighty change; but the eventful hour still tarries. It has been well observed how St. Luke's report of the angel's words here could never have been a forgery - as one school of critics asserts - of the second century. Would any writer in the second century, after the failure of Jesus among the Jews was well known, when the fall of Jerusalem had already taken place, have made an angel prophesy what is expressed here? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(estai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
