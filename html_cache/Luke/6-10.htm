In the context of <a href="/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a>, Jesus is in a synagogue on the Sabbath, surrounded by Pharisees and teachers of the law who are watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, which they considered unlawful. His act of looking around signifies His challenge to their legalistic mindset and His authority over the Sabbath. This moment echoes the divine authority seen in the Old Testament, where God often looks upon His people with judgment or compassion (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p><b>He said to the man</b><br>Jesus directly addresses the man with the withered hand, demonstrating His personal care and willingness to heal. This interaction shows Jesus' compassion and His focus on individual needs amidst a crowd. It also reflects the personal nature of God's relationship with His people, as seen throughout Scripture, where God calls individuals by name (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This command requires an act of faith from the man. Despite his condition, the man is asked to do something that seems impossible. This mirrors other biblical instances where faith is required for healing or miracles, such as Naaman washing in the Jordan River (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10-14</a>) or Peter walking on water (<a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29</a>). It underscores the principle that faith often involves action in response to God's word.<p><b>He did so</b><br>The man's obedience to Jesus' command is immediate and without hesitation. This act of faith is crucial, as it demonstrates trust in Jesus' power and authority. The man's response can be seen as a model for believers, illustrating the importance of obedience to God's commands, even when the outcome is uncertain.<p><b>and it was restored.</b><br>The restoration of the man's hand is a testament to Jesus' divine power and authority over physical ailments. This miracle serves as a sign of the coming Kingdom of God, where restoration and healing are central themes (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate restoration that Jesus brings through His death and resurrection, offering spiritual healing and redemption to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
