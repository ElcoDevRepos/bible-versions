In biblical times, inheritance was a significant part of one's identity and security. By squandering his inheritance, the son not only loses his wealth but also his social standing and future security. This reflects the spiritual state of humanity when it turns away from God, squandering the spiritual inheritance given by the Father. The act of spending all he had can be seen as a metaphor for living a life apart from God's wisdom and guidance, leading to spiritual bankruptcy.<p><b>a severe famine swept through that country</b><br>Famines were common in the ancient Near East and often seen as divine judgment or a test of faith. In the Old Testament, famines frequently drove people to seek God's provision, as seen in the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph. The famine in this parable serves as a catalyst for the son's realization of his dire situation. It symbolizes the spiritual emptiness and desperation that result from a life lived apart from God. The famine also underscores the unpredictability of life and the futility of relying solely on material wealth.<p><b>and he began to be in need</b><br>This phrase marks the turning point in the prodigal son's journey. His physical need mirrors his spiritual need, highlighting the insufficiency of worldly pleasures and wealth to satisfy the deeper needs of the soul. In biblical terms, need often drives individuals to seek God, as seen in the Beatitudes where Jesus blesses those who recognize their spiritual poverty. The son's need foreshadows his eventual repentance and return to the father, illustrating the concept of spiritual awakening and the beginning of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who demands his inheritance early, leaves his father's house, and squanders his wealth in a distant country.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_distant_country.htm">The Distant Country</a></b><br>Represents a place far from the father's house, symbolizing separation from God and a life of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_severe_famine.htm">The Severe Famine</a></b><br>A significant event that highlights the consequences of the prodigal son's choices, leading to his realization of need.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father's_house.htm">The Father's House</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's presence, provision, and grace, contrasting with the distant country.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_citizens_of_the_country.htm">The Citizens of the Country</a></b><br>Represent worldly influences and false security that fail to provide true sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sinful_choices.htm">Consequences of Sinful Choices</a></b><br>The prodigal son's experience teaches that living apart from God leads to spiritual and physical poverty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>The famine serves as a divine tool to bring the son to repentance, showing God's control over circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_worldly_security.htm">The Illusion of Worldly Security</a></b><br>The distant country and its citizens fail to provide true security, reminding us that only God can meet our deepest needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_return.htm">Repentance and Return</a></b><br>The son's eventual return to his father illustrates the importance of repentance and the hope of restoration with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Encourages believers to rely on God's provision rather than their own resources or worldly solutions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_15_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 15:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_14_Poor_planning_consequences.htm">How does Luke 15:14 illustrate the consequences of poor stewardship and planning?

The famine which "came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar" (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>) was more extensive and memorable than others, but it was far from standing alone. And now the pinch came. His treasure was gone, and for the fulness of bread there was hunger and "cleanness of teeth" (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm" title="And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:6</a>). In the individual interpretation of the parable, the mighty famine is the yearning of the soul's unsatisfied desire, the absence of its true food, of "the bread that cometh down from heaven." (See Notes on <a href="/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>.) In its wider range it is the craving of humanity for what it cannot find when appetites are not satisfied, and their wonted supply ceases--the famine, not of bread and of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:">Amos 8:11</a>); the want of a message from the Eternal Father to sustain the life of His children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spent all.</span> True of many a soul in all times, but especially in that age of excessive luxury and splendour and of unbridled passions. <p><span class="accented">"On that hard Roman world, disgust<br />And secret loathing fell;<br />Deep weariness and sated lust<br />Made human life a hell."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Matthew Arnold.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">There arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want</span>. The "mighty famine" may be understood to represent difficult times. Wax or political convulsions, so common in those days, may have speedily brought about the ruin of many like the prodigal of our story, and his comparatively small fortune would quickly have been swallowed up. Selfish evil-living, excesses of various kinds, had gained him no real friends, but had left him to meet the ruin of his fortune with enfeebled powers, homeless and friendless; hence the depth of the degradation in which we speedily find him. Not an unusual figure in the great world-drama, this of the younger son - the man who had sacrificed everything for selfish pleasure, and soon found he had absolutely nothing left but suffering. Very touchingly the greatest, perhaps, of our English poets writes of this awful soul-famine. In <span class="accented">his</span> case fortune and rank still remained to him, but everything that can really make life precious and beautiful had been wasted. <p><span class="accented">"My days are in the yellow leaf;<br />The flowers and fruits of love are gone;<br />The worm, the anguish, and the grief,<br />Are mine alone.</span> <p><span class="accented">"The fire that on my bosom preys<br />Is lone as some volcanic isle;<br />No torch is kindled at its blaze -<br />A funeral pile!"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Byron.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
