In the context of Jesus' teachings, it is a call to spiritual alertness. The Greek word used here for "watch" implies a continuous, active state of being on guard. This echoes Jesus' earlier teachings in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where He instructs His followers to stay awake and be prepared for His return. The call to watchfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, urging believers to remain steadfast in faith and attentive to spiritual matters.<p><b>or your hearts will be weighed down</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's emotions, thoughts, and will. A heart "weighed down" suggests a state of spiritual lethargy or burden. This can be linked to <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding the heart as it is the wellspring of life. The warning here is against allowing external influences to dull one's spiritual sensitivity and responsiveness to God's voice.<p><b>by dissipation</b><br>Dissipation refers to a lifestyle of excess and indulgence, often leading to moral and spiritual decay. In the cultural context of the time, this could include lavish banquets and hedonistic pursuits common in Roman society. The Bible frequently warns against such behavior, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, where believers are cautioned against drunkenness and encouraged to be filled with the Spirit instead. Dissipation distracts from spiritual priorities and can lead to a loss of focus on God's kingdom.<p><b>drunkenness</b><br>Drunkenness is specifically highlighted as a vice that can dull spiritual alertness. In the ancient world, wine was a common part of daily life, but excessive consumption was condemned. <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns that wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging, highlighting the dangers of losing self-control. The New Testament continues this theme, urging believers to live soberly and righteously, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6-8</a>.<p><b>and the worries of life</b><br>The worries of life refer to the everyday concerns and anxieties that can preoccupy one's mind. Jesus addressed this in the Sermon on the Mount, particularly in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where He encourages trust in God's provision. The cultural context of first-century Judea involved significant economic and political instability, which could easily lead to anxiety. However, believers are called to cast their cares on God, as stated in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>, trusting in His care and sovereignty.<p><b>and that day will spring upon you suddenly</b><br>"That day" refers to the day of the Lord, a time of divine intervention and judgment. The suddenness of its arrival is a common theme in eschatological teachings, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, where the day of the Lord is described as coming like a thief in the night. This imagery underscores the importance of readiness and the unpredictability of the timing of God's final acts in history.<p><b>like a snare</b><br>A snare is a trap set for catching animals, often hidden and unexpected. This metaphor highlights the danger of being unprepared for the Lord's return. In the biblical context, a snare represents sudden entrapment and the consequences of neglecting spiritual vigilance. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>, where an evil man is ensnared by his transgressions, contrasting with the freedom of the righteous. The warning is clear: spiritual complacency can lead to being caught unawares by the unfolding of God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, providing a warning to His disciples and followers about the end times and the importance of vigilance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to heed His warnings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/luke/21.htm">Luke 21</a> includes Jesus' prophecy about the destruction of Jerusalem, which serves as a backdrop for His teachings on vigilance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/end_times.htm">End Times</a></b><br>The event Jesus is referring to, emphasizing the suddenness and unexpected nature of His return.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hearts.htm">Hearts</a></b><br>Symbolic of the inner life and spiritual state of individuals, which can be affected by worldly distractions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_faith.htm">Vigilance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to be constantly alert and spiritually awake, avoiding complacency in their walk with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>The heart must be protected from worldly distractions such as dissipation, drunkenness, and anxiety, which can dull spiritual sensitivity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_the_times.htm">Awareness of the Times</a></b><br>Understanding the signs of the times and living with an eternal perspective helps believers remain focused on Christ's return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sobriety_and_self-control.htm">Sobriety and Self-Control</a></b><br>Practicing self-discipline in all areas of life ensures that believers are not caught off guard by the suddenness of Christ's return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_spiritual_readiness.htm">Prioritizing Spiritual Readiness</a></b><br>Daily spiritual practices such as prayer, Bible study, and fellowship with other believers help maintain readiness for the Lord's coming.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_21_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 21:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_focused_amid_distractions.htm">How can we avoid being "weighed down" by life's distractions in Luke 21:34?

We note in it, as such, that, as far as the New Testament is concerned, St. Luke only uses the words for "overcharged" and "surfeiting" (the latter word belonged, more or less, to the vocabulary of medical science); St. Luke and St. Paul alone those for "drunkenness" (<a href="/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>), and cares "of this life" (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?">1Corinthians 6:3-4</a>), and "unawares" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>). In the last passage we have what reads almost like a distinct echo from this verse. The whole passage, it may be noted, falls in with St. Luke's characteristic tendency to record all portions of our Lord's teaching that warned men against sensuality and worldliness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And take heed to yourselves</span>. The Master ended his discourse with an earnest practical reminder to his disciples to live ever with the sure expectation of his return to judgment. As for those who heard him then, conscious of the oncoming doom of the city, temple, and people, with the solemn procession of signs heralding the impending ruin ever before their eyes, no passions or cares of earth surely would hinder <span class="accented">them</span> from living the brave, pure life worthy of his servants. As for coming generations - for the warning voice of Jesus here is equally addressed to them - they too must watch for another and far more tremendous ruin falling upon their homes than ever fell upon Jerusalem. The attitude of his people in every age must be that of the "watcher" <span class="accented">till he come.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/21-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">watch</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Prosechete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4337.htm">Strong's 4337: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and echo; to hold the mind towards, i.e. Pay attention to, be cautious about, apply oneself to, adhere to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yourselves,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heautois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Reflexive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1438.htm">Strong's 1438: </a> </span><span class="str2">Himself, herself, itself. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#942;&#8255;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
