However, the act of bringing babies to Jesus indicates the recognition of His authority and the belief in His blessing. This reflects a deep trust in Jesus' power and compassion, as well as a desire for divine favor upon their children. The act of bringing children to a rabbi or religious figure for blessing was not uncommon, but the emphasis here is on the faith of the parents in Jesus' unique role.<p><b>for Him to place His hands on them.</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant biblical gesture symbolizing blessing, healing, and the impartation of spiritual favor. In the Old Testament, this act was often associated with the transfer of blessing or authority (e.g., <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>, where Jacob blesses Ephraim and Manasseh). In the New Testament, Jesus frequently uses touch to heal and bless, demonstrating His compassion and divine power. This act signifies Jesus' willingness to engage personally and lovingly with the least and the most vulnerable.<p><b>And when the disciples saw this,</b><br>The disciples, often acting as gatekeepers to Jesus, were likely concerned with managing the crowds and maintaining order. Their reaction may also reflect societal norms that undervalued children, viewing them as a distraction from more important matters. The disciples' response highlights a recurring theme in the Gospels where Jesus' followers misunderstand His mission and priorities.<p><b>they rebuked those who brought them.</b><br>The rebuke from the disciples suggests a misunderstanding of Jesus' ministry, which consistently emphasized inclusivity and the value of all individuals, regardless of social status. This moment serves as a teaching opportunity for Jesus to correct their perspective. The rebuke contrasts with Jesus' later response, which underscores His welcoming nature and the importance of childlike faith. This incident parallels other Gospel accounts where Jesus challenges societal norms and elevates the lowly, aligning with His teachings on humility and the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the passage, known for His teachings and miracles.

Our Lord's noticing children is several times alluded to in the Gospels. There was something evidently in his look and manner which singularly attracted little ones to him. SS. Matthew and Mark both recount this blessing of the children immediately after the teaching on divorce. Our Lord thus sanctifies the bond of marriage and its legitimate offspring. It was a silent but powerful reply to the mistaken inference which his disciples had drawn from his words. They had said, "It is not good to marry" (<a href="/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them</span>. Something of what the Master had said concerning the marriage state affected the disciples.
