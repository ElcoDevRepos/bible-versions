The entry of Satan into Judas signifies a direct influence of evil upon him, suggesting a spiritual battle at play. In biblical context, Satan is often depicted as the adversary of God and His purposes (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The act of Satan entering Judas highlights the severity of Judas's betrayal, as it is not merely a human decision but one influenced by a malevolent spiritual force. This moment fulfills the prophecy of betrayal found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where David speaks of a close friend who turns against him, a type of Christ's own experience with Judas.<p><b>who was one of the Twelve</b><br>This phrase underscores the gravity of Judas's betrayal. Being one of the Twelve Apostles, Judas held a position of trust and intimacy with Jesus. The Twelve were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and witnesses to His ministry (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-19</a>). Judas's role as one of the Twelve makes his betrayal more poignant, as it comes from within Jesus's inner circle. This internal betrayal is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/zechariah/13-6.htm">Zechariah 13:6</a>, which speaks of wounds received in the house of friends, further emphasizing the personal nature of Judas's actions. Judas's betrayal is a stark reminder of the potential for sin and deception even among those who are closest to the truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary and accuser, a fallen angel who opposes God and His people.

Scripture is clear that a personal devil can seize an unguarded heart (cf. <a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; This was not mere influence; Luke says Satan &#8220;entered,&#8221; echoing later statements in <a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a> and <a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>. The adversary gained direct control because Judas had opened a door through unchecked sin.<p>&#8226; Jesus had already warned of Satan&#8217;s designs on the disciples (<a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31&#8211;32</a>), underscoring an ongoing spiritual conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judas Iscariot</b><p>&#8226; Judas was chosen by Jesus (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13&#8211;16</a>), walked with Him for three years, yet harbored greed (<a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4&#8211;6</a>).

St. Luke stands alone in the first three Gospels as thus describing the origin of the Traitor's guilt. <a href="/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a> shows, however, that such a way of speaking had become common, though he places the "entrance" at a later stage. The use of the name Satan for the devil, as the author of the many forms of human evil, is, it need hardly be said, a prominent feature in St. Paul's writings (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>. <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Compare also St. Peter's speech in <a href="/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a>, where Satan appears as instigating the sin of Ananias and Sapphira. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-6.</span> - <span class="accented">Judas Iscariot betrays his Master. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. And they were glad</span>. This was their chance. In the very heart of the Galilaean Teacher's own company a traitor showed himself, one who knew well the plans of his Master. With his help the Sanhedrin and the priestly party would be enabled to effect the arrest privately. They then must trust to Roman jealousy to help them to carry out their evil design. The expression, "Then entered Satan into Judas," is a strong one, and definitely shows that, in the opinion of these inspired compilers of the Gospels, there was <span class="accented">a person</span> who bore rule over the powers of evil. The character and history of the faithless friend of Jesus is mournfully interesting. For one to whom such splendid chances were offered to fall so low, is an awful mystery. It is clear that the betrayal was no sudden impulse. He set up self as the one object of all his thoughts, and followed Jesus because he believed that, in following him, he could best serve his own interests. His ambition was cruelly disappointed by his Master's gradual unfolding his views respecting his kingdom, <span class="accented">which was not to be of this world.</span> He was still further shocked by the undisguised announcement on the part of his Master, whose greatness and power Judas recognized from the first, that he would be rejected by the nation, and even put to death, has been suggested, as an explanation of the betrayal, that at the last he seems to have fancied that he could force the manifestation of Christ's power by placing him in the hands of his enemies; but the acceptance of a reward, miserable though it was, seems to point to vulgar greed, and to the idea of making friends with the dominant party in the state now that his Master evidently looked forward to a violent death, as the real motives of the betrayal. The question has been asked whether Christ, in his choice of Judas as one of the twelve, read the inmost depths and issues of his character. Canon Westcott, in a profound note on John 13:18, writes "that the records of the gospel lead us to believe that the Lord had perfect human knowledge realized in a human way, and therefore limited in some sense, and separable in consciousness from his perfect Divine omniscience. He knew the thoughts of men absolutely in their manifold possibilities, and yet as man, not in their actual future manifestation." These mysteries "<span class="accented">underlie</span> all religious life, and, indeed, all finite life - for finite being includes the possibility of sin and the possibility of fellowship between the Creator and the creature Thus we may be content to have this concrete mystery as an example - the most terrible example - of the issues of the two fundamental mysteries of human existence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Satan</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Satanas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4567.htm">Strong's 4567: </a> </span><span class="str2">An adversary, Satan.
