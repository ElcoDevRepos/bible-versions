Moses and Elijah represent the Law and the Prophets, respectively, signifying the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in Christ. Their departure indicates the temporary nature of their appearance and the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant in Jesus.<p><b>Peter said to Jesus</b><br>Peter, often the spokesperson for the disciples, reacts impulsively. His response reflects a common human desire to capture and preserve spiritual experiences. This moment highlights Peter's misunderstanding of the event's significance, as he fails to grasp the full revelation of Jesus' mission.<p><b>Master, it is good for us to be here</b><br>Peter acknowledges the profound nature of the experience, recognizing the blessing of witnessing such a divine revelation. His use of "Master" shows respect and recognition of Jesus' authority, yet his understanding is still limited to earthly perspectives.<p><b>Let us put up three shelters&#8212;one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah</b><br>Peter's suggestion to build shelters, or tabernacles, may reflect the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, a time of commemorating God's provision and presence. However, his proposal indicates a misunderstanding of the event's purpose, as it suggests a desire to prolong the moment rather than understanding its prophetic significance.<p><b>(He did not know what he was saying.)</b><br>This parenthetical note underscores Peter's confusion and lack of comprehension. It serves as a reminder of the disciples' ongoing journey of understanding Jesus' true nature and mission.

The three evangelists who relate the Transfiguration scene, with trifling variations repeat this remark of Peter's. It is valuable to us when we remember that the tradition of the marvellous event comes from Peter, James, and John; and that they repeat the strange inconsequent words uttered by one of themselves - their acknowledged spokesman. No thought of self-glorification evidently tinged this strange memory of theirs. They simply wished to record the plain truth just as it happened, and in the course of the narrative they had to repeat their own poor, babbling, meaningless words - for the remark of Peter is nothing else. Their own remark, which immediately follows, is the best comment upon them, "not knowing what he said." There was a deep feeling that in such a company, bathed, too, in that glorious and unearthly light, <span class="accented">it was well with them.</span> But they saw the heavenly visitants preparing to leave them. They would stay their departure if they could, so they stammered, "Let us build some shelter; let us erect some temple, however humble, to do honour, Lord, to thee and thy companions." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Moses and Elijah]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
