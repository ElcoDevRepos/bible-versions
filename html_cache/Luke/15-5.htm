The act of finding the sheep highlights the initiative and effort of the shepherd, reflecting God's active pursuit of the lost. In biblical context, this mirrors God's relentless love and grace, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>, where God promises to search for His sheep and care for them. The shepherd's search signifies the divine mission of Jesus, who came "to seek and to save the lost" (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>he joyfully puts it</b><br>The joy expressed by the shepherd upon finding the sheep underscores the theme of divine joy over repentance. This joy is not just a personal satisfaction but a reflection of heavenly celebration, as seen in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>, where there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons. The act of putting the sheep on his shoulders is a gesture of care and protection, symbolizing the shepherd's willingness to bear the burden of the lost, akin to Jesus bearing the sins of humanity.<p><b>on his shoulders</b><br>Carrying the sheep on his shoulders is a powerful image of strength, care, and responsibility. In the cultural context of the time, shepherds were known for their dedication and readiness to protect their flock at all costs. This act is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>, where the suffering servant bears the iniquities of others.
