Roman soldiers were responsible for executing the sentence of crucifixion, a common method of capital punishment in the Roman Empire. This event follows Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate, where He was sentenced to death despite Pilate's initial reluctance. The soldiers' actions fulfill the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was "led like a lamb to the slaughter."<p><b>they seized Simon of Cyrene</b><br>Simon of Cyrene is introduced here as an unexpected participant in the Passion narrative. Cyrene was a city in modern-day Libya, indicating Simon was likely a Jewish pilgrim in Jerusalem for Passover. His seizure by the soldiers was likely due to Jesus' physical inability to carry the cross after the severe scourging and abuse He had endured. This act of seizing Simon highlights the Roman practice of impressment, where bystanders could be compelled to carry burdens for soldiers.<p><b>on his way in from the country</b><br>This detail suggests that Simon was arriving in Jerusalem from the surrounding countryside, possibly unaware of the events unfolding. The mention of "the country" indicates he was not a resident of the city, emphasizing his role as an outsider drawn into the central event of the Christian faith. This moment underscores the universal reach of the Gospel, as Simon, a foreigner, becomes part of the narrative of salvation.<p><b>and they put the cross on him</b><br>The cross, likely the horizontal beam known as the patibulum, was placed on Simon. This act symbolizes the weight of sin and the burden of the cross that Jesus bore for humanity. Simon's involvement is a vivid illustration of discipleship, as Jesus had earlier taught that anyone who follows Him must "take up their cross" (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>). This moment foreshadows the call for believers to share in Christ's sufferings.<p><b>to carry behind Jesus</b><br>Simon carrying the cross behind Jesus is a powerful image of following Christ. It reflects the call to discipleship, where believers are invited to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, even in suffering. This act of carrying the cross behind Jesus also fulfills the typology of Christ as the ultimate burden-bearer, who invites others to share in His mission. The positioning of Simon behind Jesus signifies the path of following the Savior, a journey marked by sacrifice and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the Christian faith, who is being led to crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_of_cyrene.htm">Simon of Cyrene</a></b><br>A man from Cyrene, a city in North Africa, who is compelled to carry Jesus' cross.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The instrument of Jesus' crucifixion, symbolizing the burden of sin and the path to salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_soldiers.htm">The Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>They are responsible for leading Jesus to His crucifixion and compelling Simon to carry the cross.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey_to_golgotha.htm">The Journey to Golgotha</a></b><br>The path Jesus takes to the place of His crucifixion, also known as Calvary.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_burden_of_the_cross.htm">The Burden of the Cross</a></b><br>Simon's act of carrying the cross symbolizes the call for believers to take up their own crosses and follow Jesus, embracing the challenges and sacrifices of the Christian life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointments.htm">Divine Appointments</a></b><br>Simon's encounter with Jesus was unexpected and unplanned from a human perspective, yet it was a divine appointment.

The moment reveals Jesus&#8217; real, physical weakness after savage abuse, highlights the cost of redemption, and offers a living illustration of discipleship&#8212;bearing the cross behind Jesus. What began as forced labor for Simon becomes a timeless call for all who would follow the Savior: share His burden, walk in His steps, and witness the unfolding of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-32.</span> - <span class="accented">On</span> <span class="accented">the way to Calvary. Simon the Cyrenian. The daughters of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they led him away</span>. Plutarch tells us that every criminal condemned to crucifixion carried his own cross. There was borne in front of him, or else hung round his own neck, a white tablet, on which the crime for which he suffered was inscribed. Possibly this was what was afterwards affixed to the cross itself. <span class="cmt_word">Simon, a Cyrenian</span>. Cyrene was an important city in North Africa, with a large colony of resident Jews. These Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue of their own in Jerusalem. It is probable that Simon was a Passover pilgrim. St. Mark tells us he was the father of "Alexander and Rufus;" evidently, from his mention of them, these were notable persons in the early Christian Church. Very likely their connection with the followers of Jesus dated from this incident on the road to Calvary. <span class="cmt_word">Coming out of the country.</span> He was probably one of the pilgrims lodged in a village near Jerusalem, and met the sad procession as he was entering the city on his way to the temple. <span class="cmt_word">On him they laid the cross.</span> Our Lord was weakened by the trouble and agitation of the past sleepless night, and was, of course, faint and utterly exhausted from the effects of the terrible scourging. The cross used for this mode of execution was (1)either the <span class="accented">Cruz decussata <span class="cmt_word"></span>X</span>, what is usually known as St. Andrew's cross; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Cruz commissa</span> <span class="cmt_word">T</span>, St. Anthony's cross; or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ordinary Roman cross <span class="cmt_word">&dagger;</span>, <span class="accented">Cruz immissa.</span> Our Lord suffered on the third description, the Roman cross. This consisted of two pieces, the one perpendicular (<span class="accented">staticulum</span>), the other horizontal (<span class="accented">antenna</span>). About the middle of the first was fastened a piece of wood (<span class="accented">sedile</span>), on which the condemned rested. This was necessary, else, during the long torture, the weight of the body would have torn the hands, and the body would have fallen. The cross was not very high, scarcely twice the height of an ordinary man. Strong nails were driven through the hands and feet. The victim usually lived about twelve hours, sometimes much longer. The agonies endured by the crucified have been thus summarized: "The fever which soon set in produced a burning thirst. The increasing inflammation of the wounds in the back, hands, and feet; the congestion of the blood in the head, lungs, and heart; the swelling of every vein, an indescribable oppression, racking pains in the head; the stiffness of the limbs, caused by the unnatural position of the body; - these all united to make the punishment, in the language of Cicero ('In Verr.,' 5:64), <span class="accented">crudelissimum teterrimumque supplicium.</span> From the beginning Jesus had foreseen that such would be the end of his life." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the soldiers] led Him away,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#942;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;gagon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lead, carry, take away; met: To be led astray, seduced.
