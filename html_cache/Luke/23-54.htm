In Jewish tradition, this day was used to prepare for the Sabbath, a day of rest, by completing tasks such as cooking and cleaning, as no work was permitted from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. This context is crucial for understanding the urgency with which Jesus' body was taken down from the cross and placed in the tomb. The Jewish leaders were eager to ensure that all was completed before the Sabbath began, as seen in <a href="/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31</a>, where they requested the bodies not remain on the crosses. This highlights the importance of the Sabbath in Jewish culture and the adherence to the Law of Moses.<p><b>and the Sabbath was beginning</b><br>The Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, begins at sundown on Friday and lasts until sundown on Saturday. This timing is significant in the narrative of Jesus' crucifixion and burial, as it limited the time available for His followers to tend to His body. The onset of the Sabbath meant that all work, including burial preparations, had to cease, which is why Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus hurried to place Jesus in the tomb (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-42</a>). This also sets the stage for the resurrection, as the women who followed Jesus had to wait until after the Sabbath to visit the tomb with spices (<a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24:1</a>). The Sabbath rest can be seen as a type of the rest believers find in Christ, who fulfills the Law and offers spiritual rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_day.htm">Preparation Day</a></b><br>This refers to the day before the Sabbath, a time when Jews would prepare for the day of rest by completing necessary tasks.

The later Rabbis appear to have spoken of the day "dawning" in the sense of its beginning at sunset, and so far support the former interpretation. It was possible, however, under the emergencies of the case, that the entombment began before the sunset, and may have been finished during the night, or that, in common speech and usage, the Sabbath, though theoretically beginning on Friday evening at sunset, was not practically recognised till Saturday at sunrise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on</span>.
