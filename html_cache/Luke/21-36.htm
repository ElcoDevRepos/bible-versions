In the context of <a href="/luke/21.htm">Luke 21</a>, Jesus is speaking about the end times and the signs that will precede His return. The call to "keep watch" is a recurring theme in the New Testament, urging believers to be prepared for the unexpected return of Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>). The idea of watchfulness is also connected to the role of a watchman in ancient times, who was responsible for alerting the city of impending danger (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>).<p><b>and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen</b><br>Prayer is presented as a vital means of obtaining divine strength and guidance. The phrase suggests that the events to come will be challenging and require spiritual fortitude. This echoes Jesus' instructions to His disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane to "watch and pray" to avoid falling into temptation (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>). The notion of escaping what is to come can be linked to the trials and tribulations described in the apocalyptic literature of the Bible, such as the Book of Revelation.<p><b>and to stand before the Son of Man.</b><br>The "Son of Man" is a title Jesus frequently used for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. To "stand before" Him implies being in a position of acceptance and readiness at His return. This phrase suggests a final judgment or evaluation, where believers are called to be found faithful and worthy. The imagery of standing before a king or judge was common in ancient cultures, symbolizing accountability and the hope of receiving a favorable verdict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing guidance and prophecy to His disciples about the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who are called to heed His warnings and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_man.htm">Son of Man</a></b><br>A title Jesus uses for Himself, emphasizing His role in the final judgment and His divine authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/end_times.htm">End Times</a></b><br>The period Jesus is referring to, characterized by trials and tribulations preceding His second coming.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, it is the setting of Jesus' discourse in <a href="/bsb/luke/21.htm">Luke 21</a>, where He predicts the destruction of the temple and the signs of the end times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_faith.htm">Vigilance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to "stay awake" spiritually, maintaining a constant awareness of their faith and the times they live in.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Prayer is essential for gaining the strength needed to endure trials and to remain faithful until the end.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_for_christ's_return.htm">Preparedness for Christ's Return</a></b><br>Christians should live in a state of readiness, understanding that the return of Christ could happen at any moment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/standing_before_the_son_of_man.htm">Standing Before the Son of Man</a></b><br>The ultimate goal is to be found worthy to stand before Jesus, which requires a life of holiness and dedication.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/escaping_tribulation.htm">Escaping Tribulation</a></b><br>While trials are inevitable, Jesus provides a way of escape through spiritual vigilance and reliance on Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_21_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 21:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_vigilant_daily.htm">How can we "be always on the watch" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_pray_for_strength_mean.htm">What does it mean to "pray that you may have strength"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_21_36_Eph_6_18_on_prayer.htm">How does Luke 21:36 connect with Ephesians 6:18 about prayer?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_escape_all_in_Luke_21.htm">Why is it important to "escape all these things" mentioned in Luke 21?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_confidently_face_the_Son_of_Man.htm">How can we ensure we "stand before the Son of Man" confidently?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_stand_before_the_Son_of_Man.htm">What does Luke 21:36 mean by "stand before the Son of Man"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_21_36_and_Christian_watchfulness.htm">How does Luke 21:36 relate to the concept of watchfulness in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Luke_21_36_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Luke 21:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_partial_rapture_theory.htm">What is the Partial Rapture Theory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'whitewashed_tombs'.htm">Are you prepared at all times for any situation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/always_ready_for_any_situation.htm">Are you prepared at all times for any situation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_if_the_end_comes_like_a_thief.htm">What if the end comes unexpectedly like a thief?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 21:36 Mean</div><b>So keep watch</b><p>Jesus has just described upheavals&#8212;wars, earthquakes, persecutions&#8212;and then He says, &#8220;So keep watch.&#8221;<p>&#8226;
