It reflects the fallen nature of mankind, emphasizing that even those who are morally flawed can still perform acts of kindness. This aligns with <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<p><b>know how to give good gifts to your children</b><br>Despite human sinfulness, there is an innate understanding of providing for one's offspring, a universal cultural norm. This reflects the common grace of God, allowing even those who are not righteous to perform acts of goodness. The concept of giving good gifts is also seen in <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>, reinforcing the idea that human parents, despite their flaws, can still care for their children.<p><b>how much more will your Father in heaven</b><br>This phrase contrasts earthly parents with the divine nature of God, highlighting His perfect goodness and generosity. The term "Father in heaven" emphasizes God's sovereignty and His intimate relationship with believers. This is consistent with the Lord's Prayer earlier in <a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>, where Jesus teaches His disciples to address God as "Our Father."<p><b>give the Holy Spirit</b><br>The promise of the Holy Spirit is a significant theme in the New Testament, representing God's presence and power within believers. This promise is fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles. The Holy Spirit is a gift that empowers, guides, and comforts believers, as seen in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a> and <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26-27</a>.<p><b>to those who ask Him!</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of prayer and seeking God earnestly. It reflects the biblical principle that God responds to those who diligently seek Him, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>.

The variation is significant, as belonging to a later stage of our Lord's teaching, and especially as spoken probably to some of the Seventy, who were thus taught to ask boldly for the Spirit which was to make them in very deed a company of prophets. (See Note on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ask him?</span> In St. Matthew we find the last portion of this teaching related as having taken place at a much earlier period of the Lord's ministry. It is more than probable that much of Jesus Christ's general instruction was repeated on more than one occasion. There is an important difference between the words reported by the two evangelists. St. Matthew, instead of the "Holy Spirit," has the more general expression, "good things." In both accounts, however, is the Master's assurance that prayer, if persisted in, would ever be heard and granted, and there is the all-important limitation that the thing prayed for must be something" good" in the eyes of the heavenly Father. How many requests are made by us, poor, shortsighted, often selfish men, which, if granted, would be harmful rather than a blessing to the asker! Here the Lord, the Reader of hearts, having taken notice of some of the deep earnest longings, perhaps scarcely crystallized into prayer, of his own disciples, of a John or a James, pictures the case of one who deserves a special deepening of the spiritual life, and prays some prayer for the presence of the Holy Spirit. Such a prayer, says Christ, <span class="accented">must</span> be granted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
