Angels are often messengers of God, appearing at pivotal moments in biblical history. The presence of an angel signifies a direct communication from God, emphasizing the importance of the message. In the Old Testament, angels appeared to figures like Abraham (Genesis 18) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>), often bringing news of great significance. The shepherds, considered lowly and humble, are chosen to receive this divine message, highlighting God's grace and the theme of the last being first in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>and the glory of the Lord shone around them</b><br>The "glory of the Lord" refers to the visible manifestation of God's presence, often associated with light and radiance. This recalls the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>) and the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The light symbolizes purity, holiness, and the divine nature of the message being delivered. It also connects to prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, where the glory of the Lord rises upon His people, indicating the fulfillment of messianic expectations.<p><b>and they were terrified</b><br>The shepherds' fear is a common human reaction to divine encounters, as seen with figures like Zechariah (<a href="/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-29.htm">Luke 1:29</a>). This fear underscores the awe-inspiring and overwhelming nature of God's presence. It also reflects the biblical theme of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The shepherds' fear sets the stage for the angel's message of peace and good news, contrasting human fear with divine reassurance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to deliver important news.

Here, one &#8220;stood before&#8221; the shepherds, giving a visible, physical presence.<p>- Previous precedents: <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11&#8211;12</a> shows an angel standing before Gideon; <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a> records the angel speaking to Joseph. Each appearance authenticates a pivotal salvation moment.<p>- The fact that the angel &#8220;stood&#8221; underscores stability and authority&#8212;heaven&#8217;s envoy arrives, not fleetingly hovering, but taking a stance that commands attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the glory of the Lord shone around them</b><p>- &#8220;Glory&#8221; signifies God&#8217;s radiant presence, first seen when &#8220;the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>).

Yet, in the very next verse, the angel will say, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>), revealing that God&#8217;s purpose is comfort, not destruction.<p>- Fear becomes the doorway to grace: awareness of God&#8217;s majesty prepares hearts to receive His message of peace through Christ (<a href="/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a> shows heaven breaking into earth&#8217;s routine. In one instant, a divine messenger stands before humble shepherds, God&#8217;s glory wraps them in radiant light, and holy fear grips their hearts.
