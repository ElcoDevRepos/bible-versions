Pharisees were a religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and additional oral traditions. They often held positions of influence in Jewish society. The act of inviting Jesus to a meal suggests a level of curiosity or interest in His teachings, though not necessarily acceptance. Meals were significant social events in Jewish culture, often used to discuss theological and philosophical ideas.<p><b>he said to himself</b><br>This internal dialogue indicates that Simon did not voice his thoughts aloud, reflecting a common human tendency to judge internally. It also highlights the omniscience of Jesus, who responds to Simon's unspoken thoughts. This moment underscores the biblical theme that God knows the hearts and minds of individuals, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>&#8220;If this man were a prophet</b><br>The Pharisees believed prophets were divinely inspired individuals who communicated God's will. Simon's skepticism about Jesus' prophetic status reveals a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and identity. Prophets in the Old Testament, such as Elijah and Isaiah, were known for their ability to discern spiritual truths and moral character, which Simon doubts Jesus possesses.<p><b>He would know who this is and what kind of woman is touching Him</b><br>The woman is identified earlier in the chapter as a sinner, likely implying she was known for immoral behavior, possibly prostitution. In Jewish culture, contact with sinners, especially women of ill repute, was considered defiling. Simon's statement reflects the social and religious barriers of the time, where association with sinners was frowned upon, contrasting with Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>for she is a sinner!&#8221;</b><br>The label "sinner" was often used by the Pharisees to describe those who did not adhere to the Law as strictly as they did. This reflects the broader biblical theme of self-righteousness versus true righteousness. Jesus frequently challenged the Pharisees' understanding of sin and righteousness, emphasizing repentance and forgiveness. The woman's actions, in contrast to Simon's judgment, demonstrate genuine repentance and faith, aligning with Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, known for His teachings and miracles.

Believing the Scriptures literally, we see Jesus as the omniscient Prophet who knows every heart, welcomes the repentant, and transforms &#8220;sinners&#8221; into forgiven worshipers. The verse challenges us to lay aside judgment, recognize our own need of grace, and celebrate the Savior who knows us completely and loves us still.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">This man, if he were a prophet.</span>--The words show that the Pharisee had had a half-feeling of respect for our Lord as a teacher, that he at least knew that He was looked upon by the people as a prophet. There is traceable in what he says a tone of satisfaction at having detected what seemed to him inconsistent with the conception of a prophet's character. It is noticeable that he, like the woman of Samaria (<a href="/john/4-19.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.">John 4:19</a>), sees that character manifested, not merely in prediction, but in the power to read the secrets of men's lives and hearts. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24-25</a>.) He knew what the woman was, and the so-called prophet did not.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This Man, if he were a Prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him</span>. It is clear that it was no mere curiosity which prompted his asking the Master to be his Guest. Respect and love for the Galilaean Teacher alternated with dread of what the Pharisee order to which he belonged would think of his conduct. As we have said, he compromised the matter with his heart, by inviting Jesus publicly, but then only receiving him with the coldest formality. He seems half-glad of this incident, for it seemed in some measure to excuse his haughty unfriendly reception of One from whom he had undoubtedly received rich spiritual benefit, as we shall see further on. "Hardly a <span class="accented">great</span> Prophet, then, after all, else he would have known all about her." This was what at once occurred to Simon. For she is a sinner. Yes, in Simon's mind, and in the world's estimation, but before the throne of God she was differently viewed. She had heard the Master's loving call to repentance, and a new life and a change had taken place in her whole being since she had listened to his voice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
