In biblical context, "woe" is often used to express lament or impending judgment. Jesus cautions against the pursuit of popularity, which can lead to compromise of truth and righteousness. Historically, prophets and righteous individuals often faced opposition and persecution, as seen in the lives of figures like Jeremiah and Elijah. The cultural context of Jesus' time valued honor and reputation, making this warning particularly countercultural. This phrase challenges believers to prioritize God's approval over human praise, echoing the sentiment found in <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>, where Paul emphasizes serving Christ over pleasing people.<p><b>for their fathers treated the false prophets in the same way</b><br>This part of the verse draws a parallel between those who seek human approval and the false prophets of the Old Testament. Historically, false prophets were often well-received because they delivered messages that aligned with the desires of the people, rather than the truth of God. In <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>, the people are described as loving the comforting lies of false prophets. This phrase highlights a pattern of behavior where those who speak truth face rejection, while those who tell people what they want to hear are celebrated. It serves as a reminder of the spiritual discernment needed to distinguish between true and false teachings, as well as the importance of remaining faithful to God's word, even in the face of opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon that includes blessings and woes, often referred to as the Sermon on the Plain.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in the Old Testament who claimed to speak for God but led people astray with false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancestors/fathers.htm">Ancestors/Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the forefathers of the Jewish people who historically praised false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_universal_approval.htm">The Danger of Universal Approval</a></b><br>Seeking universal approval can be a sign of compromising truth.

It would seem as though he was fearful lest the awful woes foretold as the doom of the rich, the powerful, and the persecutor, should impart a too sombre hue to the thoughts which his followers would in coming days entertain of the world of men about them. He would have his own think of the circle outside the little world of believers with no bitter and revengeful thoughts, but rather with that Divine pity which he felt and showed to all poor fallen creatures.
