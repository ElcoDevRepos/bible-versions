Censuses were conducted for taxation and military purposes, reflecting the Roman influence over the region. This aligns with historical records of Roman practices, where censuses were a common method to ensure efficient governance and resource allocation. The census also sets the stage for the fulfillment of prophecy, as it leads to Joseph and Mary traveling to Bethlehem, the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><b>to take place</b><br>The timing of the census is crucial for understanding the historical context of Jesus' birth. It suggests a specific period when Roman administrative activities intersected with biblical events. This phrase emphasizes the historical nature of the account, grounding the narrative in real-world events that can be cross-referenced with historical data.<p><b>while Quirinius was governor of Syria</b><br>Quirinius, known from historical sources, was a Roman official whose governance included overseeing the region of Syria, which encompassed Judea. The mention of Quirinius helps to date the events described in the Gospel of Luke. Although there is some debate among scholars regarding the exact timing of Quirinius's governorship and the census, this reference serves to anchor the narrative in a specific historical framework. The governance of Quirinius is significant as it highlights the political backdrop of Jesus' birth, underlining the Roman authority over the Jewish people and setting the stage for the socio-political tensions present during Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/quirinius.htm">Quirinius</a></b><br>A Roman official who served as governor of Syria.

Publicius Sulpicius Quirinus ("Cyrenius" is the Greek form of the last of the three names) was Consul B.C. 12, but he is not named as Governor of Syria till after the deposition of Archelaus, A.D. 6, and he was then conspicuous in carrying out a census which involved taxation in the modern sense; and this was the "taxing" referred to in Gamaliel's speech (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>) as having led to the revolt of Judas of Galilee. How are we to explain the statement of St. Luke so as to reconcile it with the facts of history? (1) The word translated "first" has been taken as if it meant "before," as it is rendered in <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>. This cuts the knot of the difficulty, but it is hardly satisfactory. This construction is not found elsewhere in St. Luke, and his manner is to refer to contemporary events, not to subsequent ones. It is hardly natural to speak of one event simply as happening before another, with no hint as to the interval that separated them, when that interval included ten or twelve years. (2) Our knowledge of the governors of Syria at this period is imperfect. The dates of their appointments, so far as they go, are as follows:--<p>B.C. 9.--Sentius Saturninus.<p>B.C. 6.--T. Quintilius Varus.<p>A.D. 6.--P. Sulpicius Quirinus.<p>It was, however, part of the policy of Augustus that no governor of an imperial province should hold office for more than five or less than three years, and it is in the highest degree improbable that Varus (whom we find in A.D. 7 in command of the ill-fated expedition against the Germans) should have continued in office for the twelve years which the above dates suggest. One of the missing links is found in A. Volusius Saturninus, whose name appears on a coin of Antioch about A.D. 4 or 5. The fact that Quirinus appears as a <span class= "ital">rector,</span> or special commissioner attached to Caius Caesar, when he was sent to Armenia (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> iii. 48), at some period before A.D. 4, the year in which Caius died--probably between B.C. 4 and 1--shows that he was in the East at this time, and we may therefore fairly look on St. Luke as having supplied the missing link in the succession, or at least as confirming the statement that Quirinus was in some office of authority in the East, if not as <span class= "ital">praeses,</span> or <span class= "ital">proconsul</span> then as <span class= "ital">quaetor</span> or Imperial Commissioner. Tacitus, however, records the fact that he triumphed over a Cilician tribe (the Homonadenses) after his consulship; and, as Cilicia was, at that time, attached to the province of Syria, it is probable that he was actually "governor" in the stricter sense of a term somewhat loosely used. St. Luke is, on this view, as accurate in his history here as he is proved to be in all other points where he comes in contact with the contemporary history of the empire, and the true meaning is found by emphasising the adjective, "This enrolment was the first under Quirinus's government of Syria." He expressly distinguishes it, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from the more memorable "taxing" of which Gamaliel speaks (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>). St. Luke, it may be noted, is the only New Testament writer who uses the word. Justin Martyr, it may be added, confidently appeals to Roman registers as confirming St. Luke's statement that our Lord was born under Quirinus. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</span> Hostile criticism makes a still more direct attack upon the historical statement made by St. Luke here. Quirinius, it is well known, was governor (legatus or praeses) of Syria ten years later, and during his office a census or registration - with a view to taxation - which led to a popular disturbance, was made in his province. These critics say that St. Luke mentions, as taking place before the birth of Jesus, an event which really happened ten years after. Much historical vestigation has been made with a view to explain this difficulty. It has been now satisfactorily demonstrated that, strangely enough, this Quirinius - who ten years later was certainly governor (legatus) of Syria - at the time of the birth of the Savior held high office in Syria, either as praeses (governor) or quaestor (imperial commissioner). The Greek word rendered by the English "governor" would have been used for either of these important offices. On the whole question of these alleged historical inaccuracies of St. Luke, it may be observed: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Strangely enough, none of the early opponents of Christianity, such as Celsus or Porphyry, impugn the accuracy of our evangelist here. Surely, if there had been so marked an error on the threshold of his Gospel, these distinguished adversaries of our faith, living comparatively soon after the events in question, would have been the first to hit so conspicuous a blot in the story they hated so well. And <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> nothing is more improbable than that St. Luke, a man of education, and writing, too, evidently for people of thought and culture, would have ventured on a definite historical statement of this kind, which would, if wrong, have been so easily exposed, had he not previously thoroughly satisfied himself as to its complete accuracy. Generally, the above conclusions are now adopted, lately, amongst others, by Godet, Farrar, Plumptre, and Bishop Ellicott (in his Hulsean Lectures). Godet has an especially long and exhaustive note on this subject. The conclusions are mainly drawn from the researches of such scholars as Zumpt and Mommsen. <span class="cmt_word">Cyrenius</span>; Latin, Quirinus. He is mentioned by the historians Tacitus and Suetonius. He appears to have been originally of humble birth, and, like so many of the soldiers of fortune of the empire, rose through his own merits to his great position. He was a gallant and true soldier, but withal self-seeking and harsh. For his Cilician victories the senate decreed him a triumph. He received the distinguished honor of a public funeral, A.D. 21 (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:30; 3:22, 48; Suet., 'Tib.,' 49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This [was the]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(haut&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">first</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(pr&#333;t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4413.htm">Strong's 4413: </a> </span><span class="str2">First, before, principal, most important.
