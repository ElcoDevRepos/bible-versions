The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish religious life, and teaching there signified authority and fulfillment of prophecy. Jesus' presence in the temple aligns with <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speaks of the Lord coming to His temple. His daily teaching underscores His commitment to instructing the people and challenging the religious leaders, as seen in His interactions throughout the Gospels.<p><b>but every evening He went out</b><br>This indicates a pattern of retreat and rest after a day of ministry. It reflects Jesus' humanity and need for solitude and prayer, as seen in other passages like <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>. This practice also demonstrates His awareness of the growing tension with religious leaders, as He avoids staying in the city overnight.<p><b>to spend the night on the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives holds significant geographical and prophetic importance. Located east of Jerusalem, it offers a panoramic view of the city. This location is associated with key events in Jesus' life, including His triumphal entry (<a href="/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-40</a>) and His ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>). The Mount of Olives is also linked to eschatological prophecy, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, which speaks of the Lord standing on the mount in the end times.

Strictly speaking, it meant to lodge, not in a room, but in the court-yard of a house; and so was used generally, in military language, for a "bivouac." It would seem to have been chosen by both Evangelists (it does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament) to include the fact, implied in all four and definitely stated by St. John, that most of the nights were spent not in a house, but in the garden, or orchard, of Gethsemane (<a href="/context/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1-2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That is called the mount of Olives.</span>--Better, perhaps, here, as in <a href="/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a> (where see Note), <span class= "ital">that is called Olivet.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives</span>. This brief picture of the last days of public work is retrospective. This was how our Lord spent "Palm Sunday" and the Monday and Tuesday of the last week. The prophetic discourse reported in this twenty-first chapter was, most probably, spoken on the afternoon of Tuesday. After Tuesday evening he never entered the temple as a public Teacher again. Wednesday and Thursday were spent in retirement. Thursday evening he returned to the city to eat the last Passover with his own. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/21-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Every]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
