The parable involves two debtors, one owing much more than the other, both forgiven by their creditor. The cultural context of debt in ancient Israel was significant, as debt could lead to slavery or imprisonment. The larger debt represents a greater awareness of sin and the need for forgiveness, aligning with the biblical theme that those who recognize their sinfulness and receive forgiveness are often more grateful and devoted. This echoes the teachings in <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-35</a>, where Jesus speaks of the unmerciful servant, emphasizing the importance of forgiveness.<p><b>Simon replied.</b><br>Simon the Pharisee is a key figure in this narrative, representing the religious leaders of the time who often struggled to understand Jesus' message of grace and forgiveness. His response indicates a logical deduction rather than a heartfelt understanding, reflecting the Pharisees' tendency to focus on the letter of the law rather than its spirit. This interaction highlights the tension between Jesus and the Pharisees, who often questioned His authority and teachings, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>You have judged correctly,</b><br>Jesus affirms Simon's answer, using it as a teaching moment. This acknowledgment serves to validate the logical conclusion while setting the stage for a deeper spiritual lesson. The phrase "judged correctly" suggests a moment of clarity or insight, which is a recurring theme in Jesus' interactions with others, where He often uses parables to reveal deeper truths. This moment is reminiscent of other instances where Jesus commends individuals for their understanding, such as in <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, when Peter recognizes Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>Jesus said.</b><br>Jesus' response is authoritative, underscoring His role as a teacher and prophet. His words often carry weight and finality, reflecting His divine wisdom and insight. In this context, Jesus uses the parable to reveal the nature of God's forgiveness and the appropriate human response to it. This teaching moment is consistent with Jesus' mission to reveal the Kingdom of God and challenge existing religious norms, as seen throughout His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching through a parable to convey a deeper spiritual truth about forgiveness and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_pharisee.htm">Simon the Pharisee</a></b><br>A Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house.

This hesitation exposes the heart: Simon has been judging both Jesus and the woman (<a href="/luke/7-39.htm">Luke 7:39</a>), yet now he must acknowledge a truth that undercuts his own self-righteousness.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently reveals that when confronted with God&#8217;s probing questions, people often hedge before confessing the truth (<a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the one who was forgiven more</b><p>&#8226; Simon identifies the debtor with the larger canceled debt as the one who will love more, echoing Jesus&#8217; point from the mini-parable of verses 41&#8211;42.<p>&#8226; The principle: deeper awareness of sin&#8217;s enormity leads to deeper gratitude and love for the Savior (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; By contrast, those who view their sin as small respond to grace with cool formality (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Simon replied</b><p>&#8226; Luke highlights Simon&#8217;s spoken response to spotlight the contrast between polite words and cold heart.<p>&#8226; Earlier Simon had offered Jesus no water, kiss, or oil (<a href="/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44&#8211;46</a>), revealing minimal affection. Now, though forced to state the correct answer, his unchanged attitude exposes spiritual blindness (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have judged correctly</b><p>&#8226; Jesus affirms Simon&#8217;s logic: truth has been spoken even from reluctant lips (<a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This affirmation is not applause but invitation&#8212;having judged the parable rightly, Simon is now accountable to judge himself rightly (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments occur elsewhere: Jesus commends correct answers yet presses for deeper personal application (<a href="/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>; <a href="/mark/12-34.htm">Mark 12:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus said</b><p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s final word carries divine authority; His verdict stands (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; By declaring Simon&#8217;s assessment &#8220;correct,&#8221; Jesus exposes the gap between intellectual agreement and heartfelt repentance, urging a move from cognition to conversion (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative then turns from Simon to the forgiven woman, illustrating that true faith responds in love and worship (<a href="/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47&#8211;50</a>; <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/7-43.htm">Luke 7:43</a> captures the moment when a self-assured Pharisee verbally concedes the principle of greater forgiveness producing greater love. Jesus affirms the correctness of Simon&#8217;s answer, but the scene underscores that right theology without humble repentance leaves the heart unchanged. The verse calls each reader to recognize the magnitude of personal sin, embrace the full pardon Christ offers, and overflow with the grateful love that inevitably follows great forgiveness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">I suppose that he. . . .--</span>The same word occurs in the same sense as <a href="/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>.
