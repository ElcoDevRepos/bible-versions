His use of "Master" indicates respect and recognition of Jesus' authority. This term reflects the rabbinic tradition where disciples would address their teacher with honor. John's approach to Jesus shows his concern for maintaining the integrity of their group and the teachings they have received.<p><b>&#8220;we saw someone driving out demons in Your name,</b><br>The act of driving out demons was a sign of divine authority and power. In the Jewish context, exorcism was not uncommon, but doing so in Jesus' name implies recognition of His power and authority. This phrase suggests that Jesus' influence extended beyond the immediate circle of His disciples. The use of "in Your name" indicates that the person performing the exorcism acknowledged Jesus' authority, even if he was not part of the twelve.<p><b>and we tried to stop him,</b><br>The disciples' attempt to stop the man reflects a concern for exclusivity and control over the ministry associated with Jesus. This reaction can be seen as a misunderstanding of the broader mission of Jesus, which was to spread the Kingdom of God beyond a select group. It highlights a common human tendency to restrict divine work to familiar or sanctioned channels.<p><b>because he does not accompany us.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "does not accompany us" indicates a concern for group identity and loyalty. The disciples were likely worried about maintaining the purity and unity of their group. This reflects a cultural context where group identity was significant, and there was a strong emphasis on community and belonging. The disciples' reaction can be compared to other instances in Scripture where God's work is not limited to a specific group, such as in <a href="/numbers/11-26.htm">Numbers 11:26-29</a>, where Moses responds to a similar situation with a broader vision of God's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, known for his close relationship with Jesus.

The character of John is a strangely interesting one. With the exception of his forming one of the chosen three who were in a peculiar manner received into their Master's confidence, John seldom appears, during the public ministry of Christ, to have played a prominent part. Many years had to elapse before he attained that unique position of influence in the early Church which no one seems to have disputed. In the mean time, his character was slowly forming. Fiery and impetuous, although reserved and retiring, it seemed in these first days scarcely probable that such a nature would ever deepen or ripen into that John who became the world-teacher of his Master's love. St. Luke here records two circumstances which suggested some of the Master's important teaching, in both of which John plays the prominent part. The question of John was evidently suggested by Jesus' words spoken in connection with his teaching respecting little ones. "Whosoever," said the Master, "shall receive this child in my <span class="accented">Name."</span> But John and others had just been sternly rebuking some one not of their company, who had been using, to some effect evidently, that same Master's Name, which possessed, as John saw, wondrous power. Had he and his friends been doing right in rebuking the comparative stranger for using a Name which Jesus, in his words just spoken, seemed to regard as the common property of kindly devout men? Meyer remarks here "<span class="accented">that</span> outside the company of disciples of Jesus there were, even then, men in whose hearts, his teaching and acts had evoked a higher and even a supernatural power. Certain sparks which had fallen here and there beyond the little circle of his own, kindled flames occasionally away from the central fire." Those who were ever close to the Master seemed to dread lest, if these were allowed unchecked to teach and to work in the <span class="accented">Name</span>, grave error might be disseminated. Some natural jealousy of these outsiders no doubt influenced men like John in their wish to confine the work in the limits of their own circle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Master,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Epistata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1988.htm">Strong's 1988: </a> </span><span class="str2">Master, teacher, chief, commander.
