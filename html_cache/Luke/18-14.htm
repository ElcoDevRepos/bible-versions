It emphasizes the importance and truth of the statement that follows. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses "I tell you" to introduce teachings that challenge conventional wisdom or religious norms.<p><b>this man, rather than the Pharisee,</b><br>The "man" refers to the tax collector in the parable, who is contrasted with the Pharisee. Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society for collaborating with the Romans and often being corrupt. Pharisees, on the other hand, were respected religious leaders known for their strict adherence to the Law. This contrast highlights the unexpected nature of God's grace, which values genuine repentance over outward religiosity.<p><b>went home justified.</b><br>Justification is a key theological concept, meaning to be declared righteous before God. The tax collector's humble repentance leads to his justification, illustrating that God values a contrite heart over self-righteousness. This echoes Old Testament themes, such as in <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, where a broken spirit is valued by God. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching on justification by faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>.<p><b>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,</b><br>This principle is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, emphasizing the reversal of worldly values in the Kingdom of God. It reflects the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns against pride. The humbling of the proud is a divine action, underscoring God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;</b><br>Humility is presented as a virtue that leads to exaltation by God. This teaching is consistent with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where the meek are promised inheritance of the earth. It also foreshadows the ultimate exaltation of Jesus Himself, who humbled Himself to the point of death and was exalted by God, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>. This principle encourages believers to adopt a posture of humility, trusting in God's timing and justice for exaltation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about humility and justification.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisee.htm">The Pharisee</a></b><br>Represents self-righteousness and pride, trusting in his own works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tax_collector.htm">The Tax Collector</a></b><br>Represents humility and repentance, acknowledging his need for God's mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The place where both men went to pray, symbolizing a place of worship and encounter with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable.htm">The Parable</a></b><br>A teaching tool used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through a simple account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_justification.htm">Understanding Justification</a></b><br>Justification is not based on our works or self-righteousness but on God's grace and mercy.

It echoes other moments where His word stands above all (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>). Believers can rest in the certainty that what follows is Heaven&#8217;s verdict, not a mere opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this man</b><p>The focus shifts to the tax collector, the one who had stood &#8220;at a distance&#8221; and beat his breast in sorrow (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>).

God actively opposes such pride (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). Eventually, He brings the lofty low&#8212;whether through circumstances, conviction, or final judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the one who humbles himself will be exalted</b><p>Humility is simply agreeing with God about our true condition and His supreme worth. When we lower ourselves under His mighty hand, He lifts us in due time (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>). The supreme model is Jesus: &#8220;He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death&#8230; Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>).

Pride shuts the door to grace; humility flings it wide open.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">This man went down to his house, justified rather than the other.</span>--The Greek participle is in the perfect, implying a completed and abiding justification. There is something suggestive in the fact that the "house" is made the test in each case. Home-life is the test of the reality and acceptableness of our worship. The Pharisee, in spite of his self-fratulation, betrayed a conscience ill at ease by irritability, harshness, sitting in judgment upon others. The publican, not in spite of his self-condemnation, but by reason of it, went home with a new sense of peace, showing itself in a new gentleness and cheerfulness.<p><span class= "bld">For every one that exalteth himself.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/luke/14-11.htm" title="For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.">Luke 14:11</a>. What had there been said, in its bearing on man's outward life, and as shown by the judgment of men, is here transferred, the law remaining the same, to the higher regions of the spiritual life and to God's judgment. In both cases there is a needless variation in the English version, the Greek giving the same verb for both "abased" and "humbleth."<p>The lessons of the parable force themselves upon every reader. The spirit of religious egotism, however, is not easily exorcised, and we need, perhaps, to be reminded that the temper of the Pharisee may learn to veil itself in the language of the publican, men confessing that they are "miserable sinners," and resting, with a secret self-satisfaction in the confession; or that, conversely, the publican--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the openly non-religious man--may cease to smite upon his breast, and may come to give God thanks that he is not as the Pharisee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted</span>. And the publican was right; there was mercy even for him, all sin-stained though he was. The words with which the Lord closes his teaching are full of comfort. <span class="accented">That</span> prayer he tells us was heard and granted. The "I tell you" of Jesus here means, as Stier well puts it, "I <span class="accented">tell you</span>, for I know, I have seen, I have heard all this in many such a case, and in many such prayers." With this example of prayer favourably heard, there is surely no sin-burthened soul on earth who may not take courage in seeking God's face. One great object of this parable, we may believe, was to suggest some such thoughts, to embolden sorrowful, heart-broken sinners simply to go to God, trusting in his great pitying love. It should not be forgotten that the publican's prayer was heard <span class="accented">in the temple</span>; a silent approval seems given to his having thus sought out the appointed consecrated place of prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
