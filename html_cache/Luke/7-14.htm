Jesus' action here demonstrates His authority over the law and death itself, foreshadowing His ultimate victory over death through His resurrection. This act also shows His compassion and willingness to engage with those considered unclean or outcast, reflecting His mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>and those carrying it stood still</b><br>The bearers of the coffin would have been surprised by Jesus' action, as it was unconventional and unexpected. Their stopping indicates a moment of anticipation and respect for Jesus' authority. This pause sets the stage for the miraculous event that follows, highlighting the power and presence of Jesus in the situation. It also reflects the cultural practice of showing deference to a rabbi or teacher, acknowledging His role as a spiritual leader.<p><b>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; He said</b><br>Addressing the deceased directly demonstrates Jesus' personal connection and authority. The term "young man" indicates the deceased was likely in the prime of life, making his death particularly tragic for his family, especially his widowed mother.

Here the facts make it clear that it was after the Jewish manner of burial. It was not a closed-up coffin, like the mummy-cases of Egypt, but an open bier on which the corpse lay wrapped up in its winding-sheet and swathing bands, as in the description of the entombment of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-44.htm" title="And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.">John 11:44</a>) and of our Lord (<a href="/context/john/20-6.htm" title="Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,">John 20:6-7</a>), with the <span class= "ital">sudarium,</span> the napkin or handkerchief, laid lightly over the face. The immediate effect of the touch was that they who bore the bier "stood <span class= "ital">still."</span> They must have marvelled, that One who was known as a Teacher should touch that which most Rabbis would have avoided as bringing pollution, and their halting in their solemn march implied, perhaps, both awe, and faith that the touch could not be unmeaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came and touched the bier</span>. The young man was about to be buried in the Jewish manner, which differed from the Egyptian custom. The corpse was not laid in a coffin or mummy-case, but simply on an open bier, on which the dead lay wrapped in folds of linen; so Lazarus was buried at Bethany, and our Lord in his rock-tomb in Joseph of Arimathaea's garden. A napkin, or sudarium, was lightly laid over the face. It was pollution for the living to touch the bier on which a corpse was lying. The bearers, in their amazement that one so generally respected and admired as was Jesus, the Teacher of Nazareth, at this period of his career, should commit so strange an act, would naturally at once stand still to see what next would happen. <span class="cmt_word">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise</span>. The Lord of life performed his miracle over death in a very different fashion to those great ones who, in some respects, had anticipated or followed him in these strange deeds of wonder. Before they recalled the dead to life, Elijah mourned long over the sea of the widow of Sarepta, Elisha repeatedly stretched himself as he agonized in prayer upon the lifeless corpse of the Shunammite boy, Peter prayed very earnestly over the body of Dorcas at Lydda. The Master, with one solitary word, brings the spirit from its mysterious habitation back to its old earthly tenement - "<span class="accented">K;m</span>!" "Arise!" St. Augustine has a beautiful comment on the three miracles of raising the dead related in the Gospels. He has been saying that all our Lord's works of mercy to the body have a spiritual reference to the soul; he then proceeds to consider them "as illustrations of Christ's Divine power and love in raising the <span class="accented">soul</span>, dead in trespasses and sins, from every kind of spiritual death, whether the soul be dead, but not yet carried out, like the daughter of Jairus; or dead and carried out, but not buried, like the widow's son; or dead, carried, and buried, like Lazarus. He who raised himself from the dead can raise all from the death of sin. Therefore let no one despair" (St. Augustine, 'Sermon' 98, quoted by Bishop Wordsworth). Godet has a curious and interesting note on what he calls a difficulty peculiar to the miracle, owing to the absence of all moral receptivity in the subject of it. "Lazarus was a believer. In the case of the daughter of Jairus, the faith of the parents to a certain extent supplied the place of her personal faith. But here there is nothing of the kind. The only receptive element that can be imagined is the ardent desire of life with which this young man, the only sea of a widowed mother, had doubtless yielded his last breath; and this indeed is sufficient, for it follows from this that Jesus did not dispose of him arbitrarily." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proselth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] touched</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7973;&#968;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;psato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_680.htm">Strong's 680: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prop: I fasten to; I lay hold of, touch, know carnally.
