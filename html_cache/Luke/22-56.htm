The firelight suggests a nighttime setting, likely in the courtyard of the high priest where Jesus was being tried. The fire would have been a source of warmth and light, drawing people together. This setting is significant as it highlights Peter's vulnerability and the intimacy of the moment. The firelight also serves as a metaphor for exposure, as Peter's identity and allegiance are about to be revealed.<p><b>and looked intently at him.</b><br>The act of looking intently indicates scrutiny and recognition. In a culture where social hierarchies were pronounced, a servant girl addressing a man directly would have been unusual, suggesting the intensity of her conviction. This moment of recognition is pivotal, as it sets the stage for Peter's denial. The intense gaze can be seen as a moment of confrontation, where Peter's internal struggle between fear and faith is brought to the forefront.<p><b>&#8220;This man also was with Him,&#8221; she said.</b><br>The servant girl's statement is an accusation that identifies Peter as a follower of Jesus. This reflects the growing tension and danger for Jesus' disciples following His arrest. Her words are simple yet profound, as they challenge Peter's loyalty and force him to confront his association with Jesus. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier prophecy that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>). Theologically, this highlights human frailty and the struggle to remain faithful under pressure. It also serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the courage required to stand with Christ in times of trial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later leadership in the early church.

Peter&#8217;s choice of company now tests that warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Looked intently at him</b><p>&#8226; The servant girl doesn&#8217;t glance&#8212;she scrutinizes.

Her observation begins the chain of denials, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; warning and exposing the weakness of self-confidence. The episode reminds us that God can use anyone to reveal truth, that light exposes what darkness tries to conceal, and that true faithfulness requires reliance on Christ, not on our own strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(56) <span class= "bld">As he sat by the fire.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by the light,</span> or <span class= "ital">blaze,</span> as in <a href="/mark/14-54.htm" title="And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.">Mark 14:54</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Earnestly looked upon him.</span>--The verb and adverb are both expressed by St. Luke's characteristic word.

Comparing the several accounts of the evangelists together, we see how naturally the incidents followed each other. As he entered, the portress first thought she recognized him as one of the followers of the well-known Teacher just arrested on a capital charge. Then as, weary and chilled, he drew near the fire, the firelight shone on his face, a face known to many who had listened during the last few days to his Master as he taught, with his disciples grouped round him in the temple-courts before crowds of listeners. Thoroughly alarmed, he drew aside from the friendly warmth of the fire into the outer shade of the gateway; yet he could not tear himself away from the neighborhood of the spot where his dear Master was being interrogated by his deadly foes; and even there, while lurking in the shadow, he was recognized again, and then, just as he was in the act of fiercely denying, with oaths and curses, his friendship for and connection with Jesus, came the Master by, after the second examination before Caiaphas and certain members of the Sanhedrin, being conducted by the guard to another and more formal court. And as the Master passed, he turned and looked upon his poor cowardly disciple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
