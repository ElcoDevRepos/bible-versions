This is significant as it reflects the divine assistance and hope that Lazarus receives in the afterlife, contrasting his earthly suffering. The use of a named character in a parable is unique to this story, suggesting a deeper personal connection and emphasizing the reality of the narrative. Lazarus represents the marginalized and destitute, highlighting the biblical theme of God's concern for the poor and oppressed, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41:1</a> and <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>.<p><b>lay at his gate</b><br>The "gate" refers to the entrance of a wealthy man's home, indicating a place of potential charity and assistance. In ancient times, city gates were places of judgment and commerce, but here it symbolizes the boundary between wealth and poverty. The placement of Lazarus at the gate underscores the proximity of the rich man's opportunity to show compassion, yet his failure to do so. This setting reflects the cultural norms of hospitality and almsgiving in Jewish society, where the expectation was to care for the needy, as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>.<p><b>covered with sores</b><br>The description of Lazarus being "covered with sores" emphasizes his physical suffering and social ostracism. In biblical times, skin diseases often led to ritual impurity and exclusion from community life, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>. This imagery evokes the plight of Job, who also suffered from sores and was marginalized (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7-8</a>). The sores symbolize not only physical affliction but also the spiritual and social neglect experienced by the poor. This condition contrasts with the rich man's opulence, highlighting the reversal of fortunes that will occur in the afterlife, as seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A poor man, depicted as a beggar, who is covered with sores.

The verse confronts us with God&#8217;s upside-down kingdom values: He exalts the lowly, holds the prosperous accountable for visible need, and reveals true riches as compassion and faithful stewardship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus.</span>--The word for "beggar," it may be noted, is the same as the "poor" of <a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>. The occurrence in this one solitary instance of a personal name in our Lord's parables, suggests the question, What was meant by it? Three answers present themselves, each of which is more or less compatible with the other two. (1) There may have been an actual beggar of that name known both to the disciples and the Pharisees. (2) The significance of the name, the current Greek form of Eleazar (="God is the helper"), may have been meant to symbolise the outward wretchedness of one who had no other help. (3) As that which seems most probable, the name may have been intended as a warning to Lazarus of Bethany. He was certainly rich. We have seen some reason to identify him with the young ruler that had great possessions. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/19-18.htm" title="He said to him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,">Matthew 19:18</a>.) In any case he was exposed to the temptations that wealth brings with it. What more effectual warning could be given him than to hear his own name brought into a parable, as belonging to the beggar who was carried into Abraham's bosom, while his own actual life corresponded more or less closely to that of the rich man who passed into the torments of Hades? Was he not taught in this way, what all else failed to teach him, that if he wished for eternal life he must strip himself of the wealth which made it impossible for him to enter the Kingdom of God? It may be noted that almost every harmonised arrangement of the Gospel history places the parable almost immediately before the death and raising of Lazarus (see Note on <a href="/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a>), while in some of them the question of the young ruler comes between the two. The combination, in either case, suggests the thought of a continuous process of spiritual education, by which the things that were "impossible with men" were shown to be "possible with God" (<a href="/matthew/19-26.htm" title="But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.">Matthew 19:26</a>). First the picture of the unseen world drawn in symbolic imagery, so as to force itself upon his notice, then an actual experience of the realities of that life; this was what he needed, and this was given him.<p><span class= "bld">Laid at his gate, full of sores, . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">at his porch,</span> or <span class= "ital">gateway.</span> The Greek word for "full of sores" is somewhat more technical than the English one; literally, <span class= "ital">ulcerated,</span> one which a medical writer like St. Luke would use to express a generally ulcerous state of the whole body. The description led, in course of time, to the application of the leper's name to those who suffered from leprosy, as producing an analogous condition, and so we get the terms, <span class= "ital">lazar, lazar-house, lazaretto.</span> In the Italian <span class= "ital">lazzaroni</span> the idea of the beggary is prominent without that of the sores.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table</span>. In striking contrast to the life of the rich man, the Master, with a few touches, paints the life of the beggar Lazarus. This giving a name to a personage in the parable occurs nowhere else in the evangelists' reports of our Lord's parabolic teaching. It probably was done in this case just to give us a hint, for it is nothing more, of the personal character of the poor sufferer who in the end was so blessed. The object of the parable, as we shall see, did not include any detailed account of the beggar-man's inner life; just <span class="accented">this</span> name is given him to show us why, when he died, he found himself at once in bliss. Among the Jews the name very often describes the character of him who bears it. The Greek name <span class="accented">Lazarus</span> is derived from two Hebrew words, <span class="accented">El-ezer</span> ("God-help"), shortened by the rabbis into <span class="accented">Leazar</span>, whence <span class="accented">Lazarus.</span> He was, then, one of those happy ones whose confidence, in all his grief and misery, was in God alone. Well was his trust, as we shall see, justified. The gate at which he was daily laid was a stately portal (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>). Lazarus is represented as utterly unable to win his bread. He was a constant sufferer, covered with sores, wasting under the dominion of a loathsome, incurable disease. This representative of human suffering has taken a strange hold on the imagination of men. In many of the languages of Europe the name of the beggar of the parable appears in the terms "lazar," "lazar-house," and "lazaretto," "lazzaroni." Unable himself to walk, some pitying friend or friends among the poor - the poor are never backward in helping others poorer than themselves, thus setting a noble example to the rich - brought him and laid him daily close by the splendid gates of the palace of Dives. The crumbs signify the broken fragments which the servants of the rich man would contemptuously, perhaps pityingly, toss to the poor helpless beggar-man as he lay by the gate. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores</span>. These were the wild, homeless pariah dogs so common in all Eastern cities, who act as the street-scavengers, and are regarded as unclean. This mention of the dogs clustering round him does not suggest any contrast between the pitying animals and pitiless men, but simply adds additional colour to the picture of the utter helplessness of the diseased sufferer; there he lay, and as he lay, the rough homeless dogs would lick his unbandaged wounds as they passed on the forage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
