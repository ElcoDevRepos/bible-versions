Lepers were considered unclean and were often isolated from the community to prevent the spread of the disease, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13-14</a>. By reaching out and touching the leper, Jesus defied social norms and religious laws, demonstrating His authority over the law and His compassion for the marginalized. This act of touching the leper is significant because it shows Jesus' willingness to become ritually unclean to bring healing and restoration. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who would take on the sins of humanity to bring spiritual healing.<p><b>&#8220;I am willing,&#8221; He said.</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' willingness to heal and His compassionate nature. It reflects the heart of God, who desires to restore and redeem His creation. The statement "I am willing" also emphasizes Jesus' divine authority and His role as the Messiah, who fulfills the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the coming of a healer and savior (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>). This willingness to heal is consistent with Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Be clean!&#8221;</b><br>The command "Be clean!" is a declaration of Jesus' power over physical ailments and spiritual uncleanness. In the Jewish context, cleanliness was not only a physical state but also a spiritual one, necessary for participation in religious life. By declaring the leper clean, Jesus not only heals him physically but also restores him to the community and religious life. This act symbolizes the greater spiritual cleansing that Jesus offers to all who come to Him in faith, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where confession leads to purification from sin.<p><b>And immediately the leprosy left him.</b><br>The immediate healing of the leper demonstrates Jesus' divine power and authority over sickness and disease. This instantaneous healing is a testament to the authenticity of Jesus' miracles and His identity as the Son of God. The use of the word "immediately" underscores the completeness and effectiveness of Jesus' healing power. This miracle serves as a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, where sickness and death are overcome, pointing forward to the ultimate restoration of all things in the new creation (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion by healing a man with leprosy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leper.htm">The Leper</a></b><br>A man suffering from leprosy, a condition that made him an outcast in society, who approaches Jesus for healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>A miraculous event where Jesus heals the leper, showcasing His power over physical ailments and His willingness to restore those who are marginalized.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_of_christ.htm">Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to touch the leper demonstrates His deep compassion and love for the marginalized and outcast.

Touching such a person normally rendered one ceremonially unclean.<p>&#8211; Jesus reverses the flow: instead of contracting uncleanness, He imparts purity.<p>&#8211; His touch communicates acceptance, dignity, and the removal of shame, foreshadowing how His cross will take our defilement and give us His righteousness (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am willing,&#8221; He said.</b><p>&#8211; These words reveal Christ&#8217;s heart, not mere ability but desire.<p>&#8211; Elsewhere He states the Father&#8217;s will to heal and restore (<a href="/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Peter later writes, &#8220;He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The leper&#8217;s fear of rejection meets the Savior&#8217;s gracious &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Be clean!&#8221;</b><p>&#8211; A simple command&#8212;no incantations, no rituals&#8212;just the authoritative word of God.<p>&#8211; Scripture consistently shows creative power in God&#8217;s speech: &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>); &#8220;Let there be light&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus&#8217; sovereign voice stills storms (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and raises the dead (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>); here it remakes diseased flesh.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And immediately the leprosy left him.</b><p>&#8211; The cure is instant and complete, a visible confirmation of divine authority.<p>&#8211; Similar immediacy marks other miracles: the woman&#8217;s bleeding stops &#8220;at once&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-29.htm">Mark 5:29</a>); the centurion&#8217;s servant is healed &#8220;that very hour&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-7.htm">Luke 7:7-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Physical change testifies to spiritual truth: when Christ cleanses, the result is decisive (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/5-13.htm">Luke 5:13</a> showcases Jesus&#8217; compassionate initiative, His fearless identification with the unclean, His willing heart, His powerful word, and His instantaneous, total healing.

And immediately the leprosy departed from him</span>. St. Mark adds here, "being touched with compassion." The Redeemer, at the sight of the man's awful wretchedness - wasting away, shunned by all men, dragging on a hopeless, aimless, weary life - in his Divine pity, with a sudden impulse tosses aside all considerations of ceremonial uncleanness or contagion, and lays his hand on the miserable sufferer from whom all shrank, with his word of power exclaimed, "I will: be thou clean." St. Ambrose writes here how "Jesus, because he is the Lord of the Law, does not obey the Law, but makes the Law." "Here Jesus obeys that Divine eternal law of compassion, in its sudden impulse, which is older and grander than the written Law" (Farrar). It is observable that in these sudden cases, in which the common brotherhood of man was involved, the nobler spirits of Israel ever rose above all consideration of law and custom, and, putting aside all legal, orthodox restriction, obeyed at once the sovereign dictates of the heart. So Elijah and Elisha, those true saints of God, shrank not from touching the dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] reached out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekteinas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1614.htm">Strong's 1614: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch out (forth), cast forth (as of an anchor), lay hands on.
