The disciples, primarily fishermen by trade, had just experienced a miraculous catch of fish orchestrated by Jesus. This event took place on the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in Israel, known for its fishing industry. The act of bringing their boats ashore signifies a transition from their old life to a new calling. In biblical context, the sea often represents chaos and the unknown, while the shore symbolizes safety and new beginnings. This moment marks the end of their reliance on their own efforts and the beginning of their reliance on Jesus.<p><b>they left everything</b><br>This phrase highlights the total commitment required to follow Jesus. The disciples abandoned their livelihood, possessions, and even their families to pursue a life of discipleship. This act of leaving everything is a recurring theme in the Gospels, emphasizing the cost of true discipleship. In the cultural context of the time, family and occupation were central to one's identity and security. By leaving everything, the disciples demonstrated their faith and trust in Jesus' provision and purpose for their lives. This echoes the call of Elisha in <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>, where he left his oxen and followed Elijah, symbolizing a complete break from his past.<p><b>and followed Him</b><br>Following Jesus implies a continuous, active commitment to His teachings and mission. The term "follow" in the biblical sense goes beyond physical movement; it involves adopting the lifestyle, values, and mission of the one being followed. This phrase indicates the beginning of the disciples' journey with Jesus, where they would witness His miracles, learn His teachings, and eventually carry on His mission after His resurrection. This act of following is a fulfillment of the prophetic call to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), indicating a shift from catching fish to gathering people into the Kingdom of God. The disciples' decision to follow Jesus is a type of the greater call to all believers to forsake worldly attachments and pursue a life dedicated to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is calling His first disciples to follow Him.

Peter, James, and John have just witnessed the miraculous catch (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-10</a>). Instead of staying on the water to sort or sell the fish, they haul the vessels onto the beach.<p>&#8226; The choice to &#8220;bring their boats ashore&#8221; shows finality; the fishing trip is over because a new calling has begun.<p>&#8226; Similar turning points dot Scripture&#8212;think of Elisha slaughtering his oxen before following Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>) or the disciples later dragging another miracle catch to shore before Jesus&#8217; resurrection breakfast (<a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; This literal act underscores that obedience always involves concrete steps. God&#8217;s Word presents real people making real decisions; here the boats touch dry land so the men can step into a new life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they left everything</b><p>The text moves from action to cost. &#8220;Everything&#8221; means nets, fish, business partners, and the predictable life they had known.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a> echoes this principle: &#8220;Any one of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Peter will later remind Jesus, &#8220;We have left everything and followed You&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>), confirming that this moment in <a href="/bsb/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a> was literal and lasting.<p>&#8226; For us, the passage confronts any compartmentalized faith. Whether it is possessions, ambitions, or relationships, the Lord calls each believer to hold nothing back (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and followed Him</b><p>Their decisive response culminates in continual discipleship. Follow is a present-tense lifestyle, not a one-time event.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; frequent invitation, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>; <a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a>), presumes ongoing trust and obedience.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a> reminds us, &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.&#8221; The same voice that filled Peter&#8217;s nets now directs his steps.<p>&#8226; From this point forward, Luke&#8217;s Gospel traces their apprenticeship&#8212;listening to teaching, witnessing miracles, sharing in suffering, and eventually preaching the gospel (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The call to follow still carries those same dimensions for believers today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a> records a straightforward sequence&#8212;boats beached, livelihoods abandoned, Christ pursued.
