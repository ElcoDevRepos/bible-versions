The farmer represents anyone who spreads the word of God, including Jesus Himself and later His disciples. The act of sowing seed symbolizes the dissemination of the Gospel message. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>, where God's word is compared to rain and snow that water the earth, ensuring it yields a harvest.<p><b>And as he was sowing,</b><br>The continuous action of sowing indicates the ongoing effort required in spreading the Gospel. It suggests diligence and persistence, as the farmer does not control where every seed lands, reflecting the unpredictability of how individuals will receive the message. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to go and make disciples of all nations, implying a continuous and widespread effort.<p><b>some seed fell along the path,</b><br>Paths in ancient fields were often hard-packed from foot traffic, making them inhospitable for seed growth. This represents those who hear the word but do not understand or accept it, as explained in Jesus' interpretation of the parable in <a href="/luke/8-12.htm">Luke 8:12</a>. The path symbolizes a hardened heart, resistant to the Gospel, similar to Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus.<p><b>where it was trampled,</b><br>The trampling of the seed signifies the rejection and disregard of the Gospel by those who are indifferent or hostile to it. This can be seen in the persecution faced by early Christians, as recorded in Acts, where the message was often met with opposition and violence. It also reflects the spiritual warfare described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers contend not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<p><b>and the birds of the air devoured it.</b><br>In biblical symbolism, birds often represent evil or demonic forces. In Jesus' explanation of the parable, He identifies the birds as the devil, who comes to take away the word from people's hearts (<a href="/luke/8-12.htm">Luke 8:12</a>). This imagery is consistent with <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where Satan is described as a prowling lion seeking to devour. The devouring of the seed illustrates the spiritual battle for the souls of individuals and the active role of the enemy in preventing the Gospel from taking root.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_farmer.htm">The Farmer</a></b><br>Represents those who spread the Word of God.

They would feel that in each of them, if they were faithful to their work, the "sower" of the parable was reproduced; they would remember what they had heard from his lips; how he had warned them of the reception which their words would surely meet with; how by far the greater proportion of the seed they would sow, would perish. But though the disciples and all true Christian men in a greater or less degree reproduce the sower of the parable, still the great Sower, it must be remembered, is the Holy Spirit. Every true teacher or sower of the Word does but repeat what they have learned from him. <span class="cmt_word">And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside</span>. Dean Stanley, on the scenery of the parable, thus writes: "Is there anything on the spot to suggest the images thus conveyed? So I asked as I rode along the tract under the hillside, by which the Plain of Gennesaret is approached. So I asked at the moment, seeing nothing but the steep sides of the hill, alternately of rock and grass. And when I thought of the parable of the sower, I answered that here at least was nothing on which the Divine teaching could fasten; it must have been the distant corn-fields of Samaria or Esdraelon on which his mind was dwelling. The thought had hardly occurred to me when a slight recess in the hillside, close upon the plain, disclosed at once, in detail, and with a conjunction which I remember nowhere else in Palestine, every feature of the great parable. There was the undulating corn-field descending to the water's edge; there was the trodden pathway running through the midst of it, with no fence or hedge to prevent the seed from falling here and there on either side of it, or upon it; itself hard with the constant tramp of horse and mule and human foot" ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 13.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;A farmer</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(speir&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4687.htm">Strong's 4687: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sow, spread, scatter.
