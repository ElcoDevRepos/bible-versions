The appearance of an angel here underscores the divine nature of the events unfolding. Angels appearing from heaven signifies divine intervention and support, emphasizing the heavenly realm's involvement in earthly matters. This aligns with other biblical instances where angels minister to individuals, such as in <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a> with Jacob's ladder and in <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a> when angels minister to Jesus after His temptation in the wilderness.<p><b>appeared to Him</b><br>The appearance of the angel to Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane highlights the intense spiritual and emotional struggle Jesus was experiencing. This moment is pivotal, as it occurs just before His arrest and crucifixion. The angel's appearance serves as a divine affirmation of Jesus' mission and the Father's presence with Him during His time of need. This moment is unique to Luke's Gospel, emphasizing the humanity of Jesus and His need for divine support.<p><b>and strengthened Him.</b><br>The strengthening of Jesus by the angel indicates the physical and spiritual fortification necessary for Him to endure the upcoming trials. This act of strengthening is not merely physical but also spiritual, preparing Jesus to face the immense suffering of the crucifixion. It reflects the fulfillment of prophecy and the typology of Jesus as the suffering servant, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The strengthening also parallels the support given to other biblical figures, such as Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-8</a>, where divine intervention provides sustenance and strength for the journey ahead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, experiencing deep anguish as He prepares for His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_from_heaven.htm">Angel from Heaven</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to provide strength and encouragement to Jesus during His time of intense prayer and emotional struggle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_gethsemane.htm">Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>The location where Jesus prayed fervently before His arrest.

Assuming their truth as part of the Gospel, we ask--(1) How came the fact to be known to St. Luke, when St. Matthew and St. Mark had made no mention of it? and (2) What is the precise nature of the fact narrated? As regards (2), it may be noted that the angel is said to have "appeared to <span class= "ital">him,"</span> to our Lord only, and not to the disciples. He was conscious of a new strength to endure even to the end. And that strength would show itself to others, to disciples who watched Him afar off, in a new expression and look, flashes of victorious strength and joy alternating with throbs and spasms of anguish. Whence could that strength come but from the messengers of His Father, in Whose presence, and in communion with Whom He habitually lived (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>; <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>). The ministrations which had been with Him in His first temptation were now with Him in the last (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>). As to (1) we may think of one of the disciples who were present having reported to the "devout women," from whom St. Luke probably, as we have seen, derived so much of the materials for his Gospel (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> that he had thus seen what seemed to him to admit of no other explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him</span>. The Lord's words reported by St. Matthew were no mere figure of rhetoric. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." The anguish and horror were so great that he himself, according to his humanity, must have before the time become the victim of death had he not been specially strengthened from above. This is the deep significance and necessity of the angel's appearance. So Stier and Godet, the latter of whom writes, "As when in the wilderness under the pressure of famine he felt himself dying, the presence of this heavenly being sends a vivifying breath over him, - a Divine refreshing pervades him, body and soul, and it is thus he receives strength to continue to the last the struggle." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an angel</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(angelos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_32.htm">Strong's 32: </a> </span><span class="str2">From aggello; a messenger; especially an 'angel'; by implication, a pastor.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
