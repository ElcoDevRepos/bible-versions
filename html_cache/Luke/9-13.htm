It highlights Jesus' intention to involve His disciples in the miracle, teaching them reliance on divine provision rather than human resources. This directive echoes the Old Testament instances where God provided for His people, such as manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also foreshadows the role of the disciples in the early church, where they would be responsible for spiritual nourishment (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,&#8221; they answered,</b><br>The disciples' response underscores their limited resources, emphasizing the miraculous nature of what Jesus is about to do. The loaves and fish were common food items in Galilee, reflecting the everyday life of the people. This scarcity sets the stage for a miracle that parallels Elisha's feeding of a hundred men with twenty loaves (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>), demonstrating God's power to multiply and provide abundantly.<p><b>&#8220;unless we go and buy food for all these people.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the disciples' practical mindset and their awareness of the crowd's size, which is later noted to be about five thousand men, not including women and children. The suggestion of buying food highlights the logistical impossibility and the financial burden it would entail, further emphasizing the miraculous provision that follows.

Godet here beautifully observes that this reply, and the great miracle that followed, was the result of a loving thought of the Redeemer. "John has disclosed it to us (John 6:4). It was the time of the Passover. He could not visit Jerusalem with his disciples, owing to the virulent hatred of which he had become the object. In this unexpected gathering, resembling that of the nation at Jerusalem, he discerns a signal from on high, and determines to celebrate a feast in the desert as a compensation for the Passover Feast." <span class="cmt_word">We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people</span>. The main lines of this story are the same in each of the four accounts which we possess of this miracle; but each of the four evangelists supplies some little detail wanting in the others. It is clear that there was no original written tradition from which they all copied. St. John tells us it was a little boy who had this small, rough provision. The boy probably was in attendance on the apostles, and this was no doubt the little stock of food they had provided for their own frugal meal. The barley loaves were the ordinary food of the poorest in Palestine, and the two fish were dried, as was the common custom of the country; and such dried fish was usually eaten with the bread. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
