The use of "must" underscores the divine necessity and inevitability of these events, as part of God's sovereign plan. Jesus often referenced the fulfillment of Scripture to validate His mission and identity as the Messiah. This reflects the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that Jesus' life and work were the culmination of God's redemptive history.<p><b>&#8216;And He was numbered with the transgressors.&#8217;</b><br>This is a direct quotation from <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, a passage from the "Suffering Servant" section, which is widely recognized as a messianic prophecy. The phrase signifies Jesus' identification with sinners, despite His sinlessness. By being "numbered with the transgressors," Jesus took on the role of a substitute, bearing the sins of humanity. This act of substitution is central to the doctrine of atonement, where Jesus' death on the cross is seen as the means by which humanity is reconciled to God.<p><b>For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus emphasizes the culmination of prophetic writings concerning His life, death, and resurrection. The phrase "reaching its fulfillment" suggests that the events of Jesus' passion were not random but were the fulfillment of God's predetermined plan. This fulfillment theme is prevalent throughout the Gospels, where Jesus' actions and experiences are consistently linked to Old Testament prophecies. It highlights the reliability of Scripture and God's faithfulness in bringing His promises to fruition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about the fulfillment of prophecy concerning His impending suffering and crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are being prepared for the events that will soon unfold, including Jesus' arrest and crucifixion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy.htm">Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus refers to the prophecy from <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, indicating that His suffering and association with sinners are part of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgressors.htm">Transgressors</a></b><br>This term refers to sinners or lawbreakers.

It was, as it were, a hint given to the disciples before the Passion, that they might learn, when it came, that it was part of the divine purpose that the Christ should so suffer; not singled out for the honour of a martyr's death, but hurried as a malefactor, with other malefactors, to the death of the rebel or the robber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors</span>.
