This ability to discern hearts is consistent with His nature as God, who knows all things (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>). The term "duplicity" indicates deceitfulness and hypocrisy, which were common traits among the religious leaders who often opposed Jesus. This moment reflects the broader theme of Jesus confronting the religious hypocrisy of the Pharisees and Sadducees, as seen throughout the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><b>and said to them</b><br>Jesus responds directly to their challenge, showcasing His authority and ability to address deceit with truth. His response is not only a defense but also a teaching moment for His disciples and the crowd. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jesus is questioned about paying taxes to Caesar, a politically and religiously charged issue (<a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20-26</a>).
