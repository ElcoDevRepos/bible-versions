It is a post-resurrection appearance, emphasizing the importance of His message. Jesus often used direct communication to ensure His teachings were clearly understood by His followers. This setting is intimate and instructional, highlighting the role of Jesus as a teacher and leader.<p><b>This is what is written</b><br>Jesus refers to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. The phrase underscores the continuity between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, affirming that His life and mission were foretold. Scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> are often cited as prophetic texts that speak of the Messiah's suffering and triumph.<p><b>The Christ will suffer</b><br>The suffering of the Messiah was a concept that many Jews of the time struggled to accept, as they expected a conquering king. However, passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a> describe a suffering servant, which Jesus fulfills. This suffering was necessary for the atonement of sin, aligning with the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament.<p><b>and rise from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian faith, validating Jesus' divinity and His victory over sin and death. It fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a cornerstone for the hope of eternal life for believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>.<p><b>on the third day</b><br>The mention of the third day is significant, as it aligns with Jesus' own predictions (e.g., <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>) and typological events in the Old Testament, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish.
