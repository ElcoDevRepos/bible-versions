The context is the mission of the seventy-two disciples, emphasizing the urgency and importance of their message. The lack of welcome signifies rejection of the message of Christ, which was a common experience for early Christians. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who were often rejected by their own people (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-27.htm">Jeremiah 7:27</a>). The cultural context of hospitality in the ancient Near East was significant; a lack of welcome was a serious breach of social norms, indicating a deeper spiritual rejection.<p><b>go into the streets and declare</b><br>The act of going into the streets symbolizes a public declaration, making the rejection known not just to the household but to the entire community. This public act serves as a testimony against the town, highlighting the seriousness of rejecting the message of the Kingdom. It parallels the prophetic actions in the Old Testament, where prophets often performed symbolic acts to convey God's message (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>). The streets, being the center of public life, ensure that the message reaches as many people as possible, underscoring the accountability of the community for their response to the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instructions to His disciples as He sends them out on a mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being sent out to preach the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/towns.htm">Towns</a></b><br>The various locations where the disciples are sent to spread the message of the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_streets.htm">The Streets</a></b><br>The public places where the disciples are instructed to make their declaration if they are not welcomed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unwelcoming_townspeople.htm">The Unwelcoming Townspeople</a></b><br>The individuals who reject the message of the disciples and, by extension, the message of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_mission.htm">Faithfulness in Mission</a></b><br>The disciples are called to be faithful in their mission, regardless of the reception they receive.
