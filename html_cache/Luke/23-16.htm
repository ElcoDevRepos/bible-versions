In the context of <a href="/luke/23.htm">Luke 23</a>, Pilate has been examining Jesus and finds no basis for a charge against Him. This decision follows Pilate's assessment of the situation, where he attempts to balance justice with the demands of the crowd. The use of "therefore" shows Pilate's attempt to appease both his conscience and the crowd's insistence on punishment.<p><b>I will punish Him</b><br>Pilate's intention to punish Jesus reflects a Roman practice of scourging, which was often used as a lesser penalty or a warning. This punishment was severe, involving whipping with a flagrum, a tool designed to inflict maximum pain and damage. Pilate's decision to punish Jesus, despite finding no guilt in Him, highlights the political pressure he faced. It also fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is described as being wounded for our transgressions.<p><b>and release Him.&#8221;</b><br>Pilate's plan to release Jesus after punishment shows his belief in Jesus' innocence and his desire to avoid executing an innocent man. This reflects the Roman legal system's emphasis on justice, yet it also underscores Pilate's weakness in succumbing to the crowd's demands. The release of Jesus was ultimately not realized, as the crowd chose Barabbas instead. This decision fulfills the typology of Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, taking the place of sinners, as seen in the substitutionary atonement theme throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

Pilate hopes a brutal whipping will satisfy the mob without requiring execution.<p>&#8226; The injustice is stark: an innocent Man is beaten to pacify public opinion.

Luke records it to highlight both human responsibility and divine sovereignty.
