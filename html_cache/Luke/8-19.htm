This visit underscores the normalcy of family ties, even for Jesus. The mention of His brothers challenges the doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity, suggesting she had other children after Jesus.

It had been bruited abroad that a species of frenzy had seized upon that strange Man who had been brought up in their midst, and who had lately aroused such enthusiasm in all the crowded lake-district of Galilee. It is difficult to estimate aright the feelings of his own family towards him; admiration and love seem to have struggled in their hearts with prejudice and jealousy - not in the case of Mary, but in the case of the so-called brothers. They seem ever to have been close to him during his public ministry, not among his "own," but still near him, watching him, and listening to him with a half-wondering, half-grudging admiration. But John tells us (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>) that they did not believe in him. It needed the Resurrection to convert them. The crowd round the Master at this juncture was so great that they - his kinsmen - could not press through it to speak to him. They conveyed to him, however, a message. The Heart-reader knew well what were the motives which induced them to come to him just then; the brothers were so distrustful that they had suffered themselves to be carried away by the Pharisees' evil surmises, that Jesus was possessed by a devil. The mother, influenced by her earthly fears for her Son, was induced to accompany the brothers, no doubt hoping to induce him to withdraw himself from the scene of excitement, at all events for a season. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus&#8217;]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
