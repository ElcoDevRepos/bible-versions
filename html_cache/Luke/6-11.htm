Their rage is significant, as it highlights their growing opposition to Jesus, who challenged their interpretations and authority. This anger is rooted in Jesus' actions and teachings, which often exposed their hypocrisy and legalism (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). The term "filled with rage" suggests an intense emotional response, indicating that Jesus' actions, such as healing on the Sabbath, directly threatened their power and control over religious practices.<p><b>and began to discuss with one another</b><br>This phrase indicates a shift from internal anger to external plotting. The scribes and Pharisees' discussions were likely secretive and strategic, aiming to find a way to undermine Jesus' influence. This behavior is consistent with their previous attempts to trap Jesus in His words (<a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53-54</a>). The use of "discuss" suggests a calculated effort to devise a plan, reflecting their desperation to maintain their authority and the status quo.<p><b>what they might do to Jesus</b><br>The phrase implies a premeditated intent to harm or discredit Jesus. This plotting foreshadows the eventual conspiracy to arrest and crucify Him (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). Their discussions were not merely about silencing Jesus but eliminating Him as a threat. This aligns with the broader narrative of the Gospels, where religious leaders consistently oppose Jesus, culminating in His crucifixion. Theologically, this opposition fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the suffering Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>) and highlights the spiritual blindness of those who reject Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose actions and teachings often challenged the religious leaders of His time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were often in opposition to Jesus, particularly when He challenged their interpretations of the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>The setting for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles, including the event leading to the reaction in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/healing_on_the_sabbath.htm">Healing on the Sabbath</a></b><br>The event that triggered the Pharisees' and scribes' anger, as Jesus healed a man with a withered hand.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rage_and_plotting.htm">Rage and Plotting</a></b><br>The emotional and conspiratorial response of the Pharisees and scribes to Jesus' actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_opposition.htm">Understanding Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that standing for truth and righteousness may lead to opposition, as seen in Jesus' ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger_vs._sinful_rage.htm">Righteous Anger vs. Sinful Rage</a></b><br>Distinguish between righteous indignation and sinful rage.
