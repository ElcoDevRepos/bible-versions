In the cultural setting of first-century Judea, family ties were significant, and the responsibility to care for one's family was paramount. The rich man's concern for his brothers highlights the importance of familial duty and the desire to protect loved ones from harm. This phrase also emphasizes the personal nature of the parable, as it reflects the rich man's awareness of his family's spiritual state. The number five may not have specific symbolic significance but serves to illustrate the reality and urgency of the rich man's plea.<p><b>Let him warn them,</b><br>The rich man requests that Lazarus be sent to warn his brothers, indicating his belief in the possibility of repentance and change if they receive a direct message from the afterlife. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the time that the dead could communicate with the living, a belief that is also seen in other ancient cultures. The request for a warning underscores the theme of repentance and the opportunity to turn away from sin before it is too late. It also highlights the rich man's realization of his own failure to heed warnings during his lifetime, serving as a cautionary tale for the living.<p><b>so that they will not also end up in this place of torment.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "place of torment" refers to the afterlife destination of the unrighteous, often understood as Hades or Gehenna in Jewish eschatology. This reflects the belief in a post-mortem judgment and the existence of a place of suffering for those who have not lived righteously. The rich man's concern for his brothers' fate emphasizes the reality and severity of divine judgment. This aligns with other scriptural teachings on the consequences of sin and the importance of living a life in accordance with God's will. The plea serves as a stark reminder of the eternal implications of one's earthly choices and the urgency of repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>A central figure in the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, who lived a life of luxury and neglect towards the needy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A poor man who suffered greatly in life but was comforted after death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who, in the parable, is in a position of comfort and dialogue with the rich man.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man's_brothers.htm">The Rich Man's Brothers</a></b><br>Five siblings who are still alive and unaware of the consequences of their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hades.htm">Hades</a></b><br>The place of torment where the rich man finds himself after death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_repentance.htm">Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>The rich man's plea for his brothers underscores the urgency of repentance and turning to God while there is still time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_warn_others.htm">Responsibility to Warn Others</a></b><br>As believers, we have a responsibility to share the truth of the Gospel with others, warning them of the consequences of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_needy.htm">Compassion for the Needy</a></b><br>The parable highlights the importance of showing compassion and care for those in need, reflecting God's love and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_consequences.htm">Eternal Consequences</a></b><br>Our choices in this life have eternal consequences, and we must live with an eternal perspective.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sufficiency_of_scripture.htm">The Sufficiency of Scripture</a></b><br>The rich man's request for a miraculous sign is denied, emphasizing that Scripture is sufficient for leading people to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_16_28_stress_warning_others.htm">How does Luke 16:28 emphasize the importance of warning others about hell?

He knows his brothers need clear, urgent warning while there is still time to repent.

Hell is not a symbolic idea but a real destination to be avoided at all costs. Scripture echoes this divine desire that none should perish:<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>&#8212;God sent His Son &#8220;that the world might be saved through Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>&#8212;God &#8220;desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>&#8212;He is &#8220;patient&#8230; not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221;<p>Yet the same passages make clear that salvation is only through conscious faith and repentance before death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>End up in this place of torment</b><p>Jesus describes hell as an actual place of unending agony.

Was it simply a selfish fear of reproaches that might aggravate his sufferings? Was it the stirring in him of an unselfish anxiety for others, content to bear his own anguish if only his brothers might escape? Either view is tenable enough, but the latter harmonises more with the humility of the tone in which the request is uttered. The question why "five" are named is again one which we cannot answer with certainty. The allusions which some have found to the five senses, in the indulgence of which the man had passed his life, or to the five books of Moses (!), are simply fantastic. It may have been merely the use of a certain number for an uncertain, as in the case of the five wise and the five foolish virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-2.htm" title="And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.">Matthew 25:2</a>), or the five talents (<a href="/matthew/25-15.htm" title="And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.">Matthew 25:15</a>), or the five cities in the land of Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm" title="In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.">Isaiah 19:18</a>). It may have been an individualising feature, pointing to some conspicuously self-indulgent rich man among the hearers of the parable, and so coming home to him as a warning; or, possibly (following up the hint in the Note on <a href="/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>), to the number of the Tetrarch's surviving brothers. Of these he had had eight, but Aristobulus and Arche-laus were already dead, and possibly, of course, another. Here, returning to the structure of the parable, there is a special motive for the rich man's wishing Lazarus to be sent. The brothers had seen the beggar lying at his gate. If they were to see him now, as risen from the dead, they would learn how far more blessed his state had been than the luxurious ease in which they had passed and were still passing their lives.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
