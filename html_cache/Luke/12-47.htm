In biblical times, servants were expected to understand and execute their master's desires. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for believers who are aware of God's commandments and expectations. The idea of knowing the master's will is echoed in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, which states that knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it is sin. This phrase emphasizes the importance of spiritual awareness and responsibility.<p><b>but does not get ready</b><br>Preparation is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with readiness for the Lord's return (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>). In the cultural context of the first century, servants were expected to be vigilant and prepared for their master's needs at any time. This phrase suggests a lack of action despite knowledge, which is a critical point in the parable. It serves as a warning against complacency and spiritual laziness.<p><b>or follow his instructions</b><br>Obedience is a central tenet of the Christian faith, as seen throughout the Bible. In <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commands." The failure to follow instructions here indicates a willful disobedience, which is more severe than ignorance. This phrase underscores the importance of not just hearing the Word, but also acting upon it, as emphasized in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>.<p><b>will be beaten with many blows</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of divine justice and discipline. In the historical context, physical punishment was a common consequence for disobedient servants. Spiritually, it symbolizes the severity of judgment for those who knowingly reject God's will. <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> speaks of the Lord disciplining those He loves, indicating that correction is a form of divine love and justice. The "many blows" suggest a greater accountability for those with greater knowledge, aligning with the principle found in <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>, "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents believers or individuals who are aware of God's will and expectations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes God or Christ, who has authority and expectations for His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beating_with_many_blows.htm">The Beating with Many Blows</a></b><br>A metaphor for the consequences of disobedience and neglect of duty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master's_will.htm">The Master's Will</a></b><br>Refers to God's commands and expectations as revealed in Scripture.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_the_parable.htm">The Context of the Parable</a></b><br>This verse is part of a larger teaching by Jesus on being watchful and prepared for His return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god's_will.htm">Accountability to God's Will</a></b><br>Believers are accountable for the knowledge they have of God's will and are expected to act accordingly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_negligence.htm">Consequences of Negligence</a></b><br>Ignoring God's instructions leads to severe consequences, emphasizing the seriousness of obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_and_readiness.htm">Preparedness and Readiness</a></b><br>Christians are called to be vigilant and prepared for Christ's return, actively living out their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>We are stewards of the knowledge and resources God has given us, and we must use them wisely and faithfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_action.htm">The Importance of Action</a></b><br>Knowing God's will is not enough; it must be accompanied by action and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_12_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 12:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_47_Know_do_God_s_will.htm">How does Luke 12:47 emphasize the importance of knowing and doing God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_47_s_consequences_for_disobedience.htm">What consequences does Luke 12:47 describe for ignoring God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_being_like_Luke_12_47_s_servant.htm">How can we ensure we are not like the servant in Luke 12:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Scriptures_on_knowing_yet_not_doing_God_s_will.htm">What other scriptures highlight accountability for knowing and not doing God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_47_s_role_in_daily_duties.htm">How can Luke 12:47 guide us in our daily Christian responsibilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_47_Love_vs_Justice.htm">How does Luke 12:47 align with the concept of a loving and forgiving God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_affects_Luke_12_47_s_meaning.htm">What historical context influences the interpretation of Luke 12:47?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Does_Luke_12_47_imply_varied_afterlife.htm">Does Luke 12:47 suggest varying degrees of punishment in the afterlife?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jesus_fulfill_ot_prophecies.htm">How does Jesus fulfill Old Testament prophecies and teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_angels_real.htm">Are angels real?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_god_judge_our_response_to_light.htm">Does God judge us by our response to received light?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_delilah_spirit.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'deny yourself'?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 12:47 Mean</div><b>That servant</b><p>The Lord paints the picture of a household where the master is away and has left clear expectations.

Living in the light of Christ&#8217;s return, let every servant translate knowledge into faithful action, so that the day of reckoning is met with reward rather than many blows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">And that servant, which knew his lord's will.</span>--The verses that follow (<a href="/context/luke/12-47.htm" title="And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.">Luke 12:47-50</a>) are peculiar to St. Luke, and every word is full of profoundest interest. First there comes a warning to the disciples who knew their Lord's will, who had been told to watch for His coming, to prepare themselves and others for it. That "will" included the use of all gifts and opportunities, as in the parables of the Pounds and the Talents, with faithfulness and activity in using them. On those who, with their eyes open, were sinning against light and knowledge (our Lord's words had, we can scarcely doubt, a latent reference to Judas) there should come, in this world or in the world to come, a penalty proportionably severe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 47, 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required</span>. These verses are easy to understand. They explain the broad principles upon which the foregoing statements, in parable and in direct teaching, are based. Rewards and punishments will be allotted in the coming world with strict justice. To some, great knowledge of the Divine will is given and splendid opportunities of work are afforded; to such, if only they are faithful and true, will indeed a high place in the city of God be allotted; but alas for them in the life to come if they fail, if they miss the splendid chance of being true toilers with and for God! Their portion will be the <span class="accented">many stripes.</span> To others a knowledge of the Divine will, scanty compared with these just spoken of, is given, and opportunities of doing high and noble work are here comparatively few; if these use the little knowledge and seize the few opportunities, they will, while occupying a lower grade in the hierarchy of heaven, still enjoy the perfect bliss of friendship with God. The punishment for failure here is designated by the <span class="accented">few stripes.</span> In this solemn passage it is notable that degrees or grades in punishment as well as degrees or grades in glory are distinctly spoken of. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ekeinos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1565.htm">Strong's 1565: </a> </span><span class="str2">That, that one there, yonder.
