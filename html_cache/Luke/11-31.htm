Sheba is believed to be located in present-day Yemen, a region known for its wealth and trade. Her visit to Solomon highlights her recognition of his God-given wisdom. In the context of judgment, her actions serve as a rebuke to the people of Jesus' time, who failed to recognize the wisdom and authority of Jesus, despite His greater revelation. The phrase "rise at the judgment" indicates a future eschatological event where all will be held accountable. The Queen's condemnation of "this generation" underscores the seriousness of rejecting divine wisdom and revelation.<p><b>for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,</b><br>The phrase "ends of the earth" emphasizes the great distance and effort the Queen of Sheba undertook to seek Solomon's wisdom. This journey signifies her earnest desire for truth and understanding, contrasting with the indifference or hostility of Jesus' contemporaries. Solomon's wisdom, a gift from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), was renowned and attracted many, yet it was a mere shadow of the wisdom embodied in Christ. The Queen's actions exemplify the pursuit of divine wisdom, a theme echoed in Proverbs and <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where seeking wisdom is commended.<p><b>and now One greater than Solomon is here.</b><br>This statement asserts the superiority of Jesus over Solomon, who was considered the wisest king of Israel. Jesus, as the incarnate Word of God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodies divine wisdom and authority far surpassing that of Solomon. This claim challenges the audience to recognize Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the Son of God. The comparison to Solomon also highlights Jesus' role as the ultimate fulfillment of Old Testament types and prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, where the coming Messiah is described as the "Wonderful Counselor." The presence of "One greater than Solomon" calls for a response of faith and repentance, as Jesus' teachings and miracles testify to His divine nature and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen_of_the_south.htm">The Queen of the South</a></b><br>This refers to the Queen of Sheba, who visited King Solomon to test his wisdom with hard questions.

The Queen of Sheba, her visit to King Solomon, and its subsequent results made a lasting impression throughout the East; probably the immediate consequence was that a great commerce was opened up between Yemen, of which she was queen, and other parts of Arabia and the far East. The Talmud and Koran, for instance, have various legends respecting this Eastern queen who was so dazzled and impressed by the magnificent Israelitic sovereign. Such a simile would be singularly attractive to the common folk who were then, we know (from ver. 29), crowding round Jesus. King Solomon's wisdom charmed and attracted from far countries the famous queen. Lo! One wiser than Solomon was in their midst: can we not hear from the honest, plain folk around him a murmur of assent here? Hadn't they been just listening to his wise words when the Pharisees tried to prejudice them against him? Hadn't they burst out, in the person of the woman of vers. 27, 28, with an irrepressible sign of admiration? Lo! the great Arabian queen, when at the day of judgment she arose, would condemn Israel for their blind folly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The Queen</span><br /><span class="grk">&#914;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Basilissa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_938.htm">Strong's 938: </a> </span><span class="str2">A queen.
