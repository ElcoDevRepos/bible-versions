The people of Nazareth, His hometown, were impressed by His teaching. This reflects the common practice of Jewish synagogues where visiting teachers would be invited to read and expound on the Scriptures. The favorable response suggests that Jesus' reputation as a teacher and miracle worker had preceded Him, aligning with the accounts of His early ministry in Galilee.<p><b>and marveled at the gracious words that came from His lips.</b><br>The term "gracious words" highlights the wisdom and authority with which Jesus spoke. His teaching was characterized by grace, a hallmark of His ministry, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where Jesus is described as "full of grace and truth." The marveling of the people suggests that His words were not only eloquent but also carried a depth and insight that was unexpected from someone they knew as a local carpenter. This reaction is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus' teaching astonished listeners (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the son of Joseph?&#8221; they asked.</b><br>This question reflects the skepticism and familiarity of the people of Nazareth. They knew Jesus as the son of Joseph, a carpenter, which made it difficult for them to reconcile His humble origins with the authority and wisdom He displayed. This skepticism is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' identity and authority are questioned by those who knew Him before His public ministry. The reference to Joseph also underscores Jesus' humanity and His fulfillment of the prophecy of the Messiah coming from humble beginnings, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>. This question foreshadows the rejection Jesus would face, as familiarity bred contempt among those who could not see beyond His earthly family ties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking in the synagogue in Nazareth, His hometown.

The same tongues praising Him now will soon doubt or even reject Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and marveled at the gracious words that came from His lips</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Gracious&#8221; highlights both tone and content. Jesus has just read <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a> and declared its fulfillment (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>). Listeners are stunned that prophecy is unfolding before their eyes&#8212;and ears.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a> anticipated Messiah: &#8220;Grace has anointed Your lips.&#8221; Luke shows that promise kept.<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s amazement resembles <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where other listeners are astonished because He teaches &#8220;as one who had authority.&#8221; Authority and grace are perfectly married in Him (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His speech models what <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a> commands of believers.

The crowd&#8217;s low view of Him reveals their incomplete knowledge, not Christ&#8217;s limited nature.<p>&#8226; The shift from praise to doubt warns modern readers: exposure to Jesus does not equal faith.
