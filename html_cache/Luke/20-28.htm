In the Gospels, Jesus is often approached by religious leaders and others seeking His interpretation of the Law. This encounter occurs in Jerusalem, where Jesus is teaching in the temple courts, a place of significant religious activity and debate.<p><b>&#8220;Moses wrote for us that if a man&#8217;s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children,</b><br>This refers to the practice of levirate marriage, which is outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>. The law was given by Moses to ensure the continuation of a family line and the preservation of property within the tribe. It reflects the cultural importance of family lineage and inheritance in ancient Israelite society. The Sadducees, who are posing this question, are referencing the Torah, which they held in high regard.<p><b>the man is to marry his brother&#8217;s widow</b><br>The practice of levirate marriage required the deceased man's brother to marry the widow. This was a legal and social obligation intended to provide for the widow and ensure the deceased brother's name and estate were preserved. This practice underscores the communal and familial responsibilities emphasized in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>and raise up offspring for him.</b><br>The primary purpose of this law was to produce an heir for the deceased brother, ensuring his name and lineage would not be lost. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern emphasis on progeny and inheritance.
