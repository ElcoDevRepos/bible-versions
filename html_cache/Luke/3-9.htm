In biblical times, an axe was a common tool for cutting down trees, symbolizing the readiness to remove what is unproductive. The imagery of the axe at the root suggests that the judgment is not only near but also thorough, targeting the very foundation. This reflects the urgency of John the Baptist's message of repentance. The root of the trees can also symbolize the core of Israel's spiritual life, indicating that God is prepared to address the fundamental issues of faith and obedience. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>, where God is depicted as cutting down the proud and lofty.<p><b>and every tree that does not produce good fruit</b><br>In the Bible, trees often symbolize people or nations, and fruit represents the outcomes of one's life or actions. Good fruit is indicative of a life aligned with God's will, characterized by righteousness and obedience. This phrase emphasizes the expectation of tangible evidence of repentance and faith. In <a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-20</a>, Jesus also uses the metaphor of trees and fruit to describe the necessity of producing good works as evidence of true faith. The absence of good fruit suggests a failure to live according to God's standards, warranting divine judgment.<p><b>will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the consequences of failing to produce good fruit. The act of cutting down and burning a tree was a common practice for disposing of unproductive or diseased trees, symbolizing complete destruction. Fire in biblical literature often represents judgment and purification. In this context, it signifies the finality and severity of God's judgment on those who do not repent. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, where the weeds are gathered and burned, and <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>, which speaks of the lake of fire as the ultimate judgment.

This intensifies the statement respecting the power of God to raise up, out of the very river shingle at their feet, children who should inherit the glorious promises made to Abraham. Nay, more, the Divine Woodman had already laid the axe at the root of the tree of Israel; its hours, as the peculiar people, were indeed numbered. Let these, who said they were willing to wash and be clean, be ready and bring forth fruit worthy of their high calling and the lofty prerogative of which they boasted. The last of the prophets, from his lonely watch-tower of unerring insight into the future, saw the awful coming doom of the loved city, the scattering and captivity of the remnant of the chosen people. Within forty years of that time would the fatal axe, now lying at the root of the tree, be lifted. In uttering this stern prophetic saying, we believe John was gazing at the storm gathering round Jerusalem, which in A.D. swept away city and temple, and destroyed the existence of Israel as a nation.
