This reflects the strong community and loyalty among his followers. John&#8217;s imprisonment is a result of his bold proclamation against Herod&#8217;s unlawful marriage (<a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3-4</a>). The act of sending disciples indicates John&#8217;s continued leadership and concern for the fulfillment of his prophetic mission.<p><b>and sent them to ask the Lord</b><br>The term "the Lord" signifies recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. This title is consistent with the messianic expectations of the time, where the Messiah was anticipated as a divine figure. The act of sending messengers is reminiscent of Old Testament prophets who often used intermediaries to convey messages (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2-3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Are You the One who was to come</b><br>This question reflects the messianic expectation rooted in Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speak of the coming of a deliverer. John&#8217;s question may stem from a desire for confirmation, as Jesus&#8217; ministry did not fully align with the common expectation of a political Messiah who would overthrow Roman rule.<p><b>or should we look for someone else?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a moment of doubt or uncertainty, possibly due to John&#8217;s imprisonment and the nature of Jesus&#8217; ministry, which focused on spiritual rather than political deliverance. It highlights the tension between contemporary Jewish expectations of the Messiah and the reality of Jesus&#8217; mission.

Disappointed in the career of Jesus, possibly himself partly forgotten, accustomed to the wild freedom of a desert-life, suffering from the hopeless imprisonment, - had his faith begun to waver? or was the question put with a view of reassuring his own disciples, with the intention of giving these faithful followers of his an opportunity of convincing themselves of the power and real glory of Jesus? In other words, was it for <span class="accented">his own</span> sake or for <span class="accented">his disciples</span> <span class="accented">sakes</span> that he sent to ask the question? Generally speaking, the second of these two conclusions - that which ascribed the question to a desire on the part of John to help his disciples (which we will call B) - was adopted by the expositors of the early Church. A good example of this school of interpretation is the following quotation from St. Jerome: "John does not put this question from ignorance, for he himself had proclaimed Christ to be 'the Lamb of God.' But as our Lord asked concerning the body of Lazarus, 'Where have ye laid him?' (<a href="/john/11-34.htm">John 11:34</a>), in order that they who answered the question might, by their own answer, be led to faith, so John, now about to be slain by Herod, sends his disciples to Jesus, in order that, by this occasion, they who were jealous of the fame of Jesus (<a href="/luke/9-14.htm">Luke 9:14</a>; <a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>) might see his mighty works and believe in him, and that, while their master asked the question by them, they might hear the truth for themselves" (St. Jerome, quoted by Wordsworth). To the same effect wrote SS. Ambrose, Hilary, Chrysostom, Theophylact. Among the Reformers, Calvin, Beza, and Melancthon contended for this opinion respecting the Baptist's message to Christ, and in our days Stier and Bishop Wordsworth. On the other hand, Tertullian among the Fathers, and nearly all the modern expositors, believe that the question of John was prompted by his own wavering faith - a faltering no doubt shared in by his own disciples. This conclusion (which we will term A) is adopted, with slightly varying modifications, by Meyer, Ewald, Neander, Godet, Plumptre, Farrar, and Morrison. This way - (A) generally adopted by the modern school of expositors - of understanding the Baptist's question to Jesus, is evidently the conclusion which would suggest itself to all minds who went to the story without any preconceived desire to purge the character of a great saint from what they imagine to be a blot; and we shall presently see that our Lord, in his answer to the question, where a rebuke is exquisitely veiled in a beatitude, evidently understood the forerunner's question in this sense. It is thus ever the practice of Holy Scripture; while it tenderly and lovingly handles the characters of its heroes, it never flinches from the truth. We see God's noblest saints, such as Moses and Elijah (John's own prototype) in the Old Testament, Peter and Paul in the New Testament, depicted in this book of truth with all their faults; nothing is hid. Only <span class="accented">one</span> flawless character appears in its storied pages - it is only the Master of Peter and Paul who never turns aside from the path of right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">John</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
