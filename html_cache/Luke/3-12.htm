They were known for collecting more than required, enriching themselves at the expense of their fellow Jews. The fact that tax collectors came to be baptized indicates a significant movement of repentance and transformation. This act of coming to John the Baptist for baptism shows their acknowledgment of sin and desire for a new way of life. It highlights the inclusive nature of John's message, which called all people, regardless of their social standing or past actions, to repentance. This moment foreshadows the later ministry of Jesus, who frequently associated with tax collectors and sinners, emphasizing the availability of God's grace to all (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10-13</a>, <a href="/luke/19.htm">Luke 19:1-10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; they asked,</b><br>The use of the term "Teacher" shows respect and recognition of John's authority as a spiritual leader. In Jewish culture, teachers or rabbis were highly respected figures who provided guidance on religious and ethical matters. By addressing John as "Teacher," the tax collectors demonstrate their willingness to learn and change. This title also connects to the broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus is often referred to as "Teacher," indicating a continuity in the role of guiding people towards righteousness.<p><b>&#8220;what should we do?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects a genuine desire for practical guidance on how to live a life that aligns with the repentance they are expressing through baptism. It shows an openness to change and a willingness to take actionable steps towards righteousness. This inquiry is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where individuals seek specific instructions on how to live according to God's will (e.g., <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, where the crowd asks Peter, "Brothers, what shall we do?"). It underscores the transformative power of repentance, which is not just about feeling remorse but also about making concrete changes in behavior. This question sets the stage for John's ethical teachings, which emphasize fairness and integrity, particularly relevant for tax collectors known for their corrupt practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tax_collectors.htm">Tax Collectors</a></b><br>In the context of first-century Judea, tax collectors were often despised by the Jewish people because they worked for the Roman authorities and were known for extorting money.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the Latin publicani (whence our rendering), were men who collected the Roman taxes or imposts. These imperial taxes, the most painful and everpresent reminder to the Jew of his subject and dependent position, were in the first instance leased out to jobbers and speculators of the equestrian order; these were properly the publicani. Beneath them and in their employ were a numerous staff who performed for these farmers of the imperial revenue the various disagreeable duties connected with the collection of the taxes. Then, as now in the East, bribery, corruption, oppression, and unfair dealing, were too common among all ranks of officials First, then, the duty itself, the being concerned in the collection of a tribute - for that is what these taxes really were - for Gentile Rome, and, secondly, the various iniquities connected with the gathering of this tribute, made the tax or tribute collectors of all ranks odious among the Jews dwelling in Palestine. Many of the posts, especially the subordinate ones, in this department of tribute and taxes, were held by Jews, in all ages singularly gifted in matters which have to do with finance. The Jew, however in the days of John the Baptist, who could stoop to such an employment, lucrative though it might be, was looked upon by his stricter fellow-countrymen with feelings of intense scorn. Yet even <span class="accented">these</span> men are not bidden by this inspired prophet of the Highest to change their way of life, but only its manner. "Would you," he says to these men who belonged to the hated calling, "indeed wash and be clean in the eyes of the All-Seeing? then in that profession of yours, remember, be scrupulous, be honest." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">tax collectors</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(tel&#333;nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5057.htm">Strong's 5057: </a> </span><span class="str2">A publican, collector of taxes.
