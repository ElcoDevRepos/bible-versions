The demons' plea indicates their recognition of Jesus' divine power and authority. In the cultural context of the time, demons were understood to be malevolent spiritual beings opposed to God. The fact that they begged Jesus shows their subservience to Him, aligning with <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>, which states that even demons believe in God and shudder. This encounter underscores Jesus' role as the Messiah, who has come to defeat evil.<p><b>not to order them</b><br>The demons' request not to be ordered reflects their understanding of Jesus' sovereign will. In the biblical context, Jesus' commands are absolute, and His word carries the power to enact His will. This is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus exercises authority over nature, illness, and spiritual entities (e.g., calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). The demons' fear of Jesus' command demonstrates their awareness of His ultimate control over their fate.<p><b>to go into the Abyss.</b><br>The Abyss, in biblical literature, is often associated with a place of confinement for evil spirits. In <a href="/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9:1-11</a>, the Abyss is depicted as a deep pit from which demonic locusts emerge, and in <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>, it is where Satan is bound for a thousand years. The demons' fear of being sent to the Abyss suggests it is a place of torment and restriction, contrasting with their current freedom to roam the earth. This reflects the eschatological belief in the final judgment and the ultimate defeat of evil, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21-22</a>, where rebellious spiritual beings are punished. The request not to be sent there indicates their desire to avoid premature judgment and continue their malevolent activities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who has authority over all creation, including the spiritual realm.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual beings opposed to God, who recognize Jesus' authority and plead with Him not to send them into the Abyss.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abyss.htm">Abyss</a></b><br>A term used to describe a place of confinement for evil spirits, often associated with the final judgment or a place of torment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gerasenes.htm">Gerasenes</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, located on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/legion.htm">Legion</a></b><br>The name given by the demons to describe their multitude, indicating a large number of evil spirits possessing the man.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus has supreme authority over the spiritual realm.

The scene is continuous, as in <a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-2</a>, showing that Jesus&#8217; authority over evil is part of His ongoing ministry, never an isolated event.<p>- Luke repeatedly links events this way (compare <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40-41</a>), reminding us that the Lord&#8217;s power operates moment by moment, circumstance by circumstance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the demons kept begging</b><p>- &#8220;Kept begging&#8221; paints a picture of nonstop pleading.

Their terror underscores that evil is subject to Christ&#8217;s command, and the Abyss is a real, reserved place of punishment. The verse assures believers that the Lord&#8217;s triumph over darkness is certain, comprehensive, and ultimately irreversible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">To go out into the deep.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">into the abyss.</span> The word is not found in the other Gospels, and it clearly means, not the deep waters of the Galilean lake, but the pit, the "bottomless pit" of <a href="/context/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>.

The direful confusion in the state of the poor demoniac is shown by this request. By whom was it made? The bystanders could discern no difference between the possessed and the spirits dwelling in the afflicted human being. So St. Mark, in his relation, puts these words into the demoniac's mouth, "And <span class="accented">he</span> besought him much that he would not send <span class="accented">them</span> away out of the country;" apparently here partly conscious of his own personal being, and partly identifying himself with the demoniac forces which were afflicting him. The request is a strange one, and suggests much anxious thought. What is the abyss these rebel-spirits dreaded with so great a dread? It would seem as though, to use Godet's thought, that for beings alienated from God, the power of acting on the world is a temporary solace to their unrest, and that to be deprived of this power is for them just what a return to prison is for the captive. St. Mark's expression here is a curious one. He represents the spirits requesting Jesus "not to send them away out of the country." The two accounts put together tell us that these spirits were aware, if they were driven out of the country - whatever that expression signified, this earth possibly - they must go out into the deep, the abyss, what is called "the bottomless pit" in <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>. Any doom seemed to these lost ones preferable to <span class="accented">that.</span> The whole train of thought suggested by the incident and the words of the Lord is very terrible. We see at least one reason <span class="accented">why</span> the first preachers of the Word have selected <span class="accented">this</span> exorcism. It indeed lifts a bit of the curtain which hangs between us and the night of endless woe! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the demons] kept begging</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(parekaloun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3870.htm">Strong's 3870: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and kaleo; to call near, i.e. Invite, invoke.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
