Throughout the Bible, God has spoken to His people in various ways, including through direct revelation, dreams, visions, and most notably, through His prophets. This underscores the belief in the Bible as the inspired Word of God, where God&#8217;s will and purposes are revealed to His people. The act of speaking signifies a personal and relational God who desires to communicate with His creation.<p><b>through His holy prophets</b><br>The prophets were individuals chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people. They were considered holy, set apart for the specific purpose of conveying God&#8217;s words. The role of a prophet was not only to foretell future events but also to call people back to faithfulness and obedience to God&#8217;s covenant. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel played crucial roles in guiding Israel and Judah, often warning of judgment while also offering hope of redemption. The holiness of the prophets underscores their divine appointment and the sacredness of their message.<p><b>those of ages past</b><br>This phrase refers to the long history of prophetic tradition in Israel, stretching back to figures like Moses, Samuel, and Elijah. It highlights the continuity and consistency of God&#8217;s message throughout history. The prophets of old spoke of God&#8217;s promises, including the coming of the Messiah, which is a central theme in the New Testament. This continuity is seen as evidence of God&#8217;s unchanging nature and His faithfulness to His promises. The phrase also connects the New Testament narrative to the Old Testament, showing the fulfillment of prophecies and the unfolding of God&#8217;s redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate speaker and source of prophecy, who communicates His will and plans through His chosen prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_prophets.htm">Holy Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals chosen by God throughout history to deliver His messages and reveal His plans to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ages_past.htm">Ages Past</a></b><br>Refers to the historical timeline of the Old Testament, where God consistently communicated with His people through prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithfulness_of_god.htm">The Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>God is faithful in His promises, as evidenced by His consistent communication through the prophets.
