In the cultural context of the first century, a servant or slave was wholly devoted to their master, with no room for dual allegiance. The concept of servitude in ancient times was one of complete submission and obedience, reflecting the total commitment expected in one's relationship with God. This principle is echoed in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, emphasizing the singular devotion required in spiritual matters.<p><b>Either he will hate the one and love the other,</b><br>The language of "hate" and "love" here is a Semitic expression denoting preference and priority rather than emotional extremes. In biblical terms, to "hate" can mean to choose against or to reject in favor of something else. This phrase underscores the idea that one cannot equally prioritize two conflicting interests. The choice between God and worldly pursuits is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where the Israelites are urged to choose whom they will serve.<p><b>or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.</b><br>Devotion implies a deep, unwavering commitment, while to "despise" suggests a disregard or devaluation. This reflects the biblical teaching that allegiance to God requires a renunciation of competing loyalties. The call to devotion is a central tenet of the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. The contrast between devotion and disdain illustrates the incompatibility of serving both God and worldly desires.<p><b>You cannot serve both God and money.&#8221;</b><br>The term "money" here is translated from the Aramaic word "mammon," which encompasses wealth and material possessions. This statement is a direct challenge to the idolatry of wealth, a common temptation throughout history. The Bible consistently warns against the dangers of materialism, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which describes the love of money as a root of all kinds of evil. This teaching calls believers to prioritize their spiritual relationship with God over the pursuit of earthly riches, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that treasures in heaven are of greater value than those on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the Pharisees about the dangers of wealth and the impossibility of serving two masters.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, they are being instructed on the principles of the Kingdom of God and the proper attitude towards wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the broader context and are known for their love of money, which Jesus addresses in His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Represented as one of the masters, God is the ultimate authority and the one whom believers are called to serve wholeheartedly.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/money.htm">Money (Mammon)</a></b><br>The other master in the analogy, representing wealth and material possessions, which can become an idol if prioritized over God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/undivided_loyalty.htm">Undivided Loyalty</a></b><br>Believers are called to serve God with an undivided heart.

One master will inevitably win your heart.<p>&#8226; Jesus elsewhere demands primary affection: &#8220;Anyone who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p>&#8226; When the heart gravitates to one master, the other becomes neglected, even resented.

Thus he tried, after his light, to serve God, but he also served mammon: this we learn, too, clearly from the description given to us of his life, from the mention of the gorgeous apparel and the sumptuous feeding. The service of the two was incompatible, and we know from the sombre sequel of the story to which master the rich man really held, and whom - alas for him! - in his heart he despised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Oudeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3762.htm">Strong's 3762: </a> </span><span class="str2">No one, none, nothing. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">servant</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(oiket&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3610.htm">Strong's 3610: </a> </span><span class="str2">A household servant.
