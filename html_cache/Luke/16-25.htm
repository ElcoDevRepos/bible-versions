His presence in the narrative underscores the importance of faith and righteousness. Abraham's role as a speaker highlights the authority and wisdom attributed to him, as he is often seen as a mediator between God and humanity in Jewish tradition.<p><b>Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things</b><br>The term "child" indicates a familial relationship, suggesting a sense of belonging or kinship. This phrase emphasizes the temporal nature of earthly wealth and comfort. The rich man, who lived a life of luxury, is reminded of the opportunities he had to use his resources for good. This reflects the biblical principle that material blessings come with the responsibility to help others, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>.<p><b>while Lazarus received bad things</b><br>Lazarus, whose name means "God has helped," represents those who suffer in this life but maintain faith and righteousness. His suffering contrasts with the rich man's comfort, highlighting the theme of divine justice and reversal of fortunes. This aligns with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>, where Jesus blesses the poor and those who mourn, promising them future comfort and reward.<p><b>But now he is comforted here</b><br>The comfort Lazarus receives in the afterlife signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to those who endure suffering with faith. This reflects the eschatological hope found throughout Scripture, where the faithful are ultimately rewarded. <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a> speaks of a time when God will wipe away every tear, and there will be no more pain or suffering.<p><b>while you are in agony</b><br>The rich man's agony serves as a warning about the consequences of a life focused solely on self-indulgence and neglect of others. This phrase underscores the reality of divine judgment and the eternal consequences of one's earthly choices. It echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where the separation of the righteous and the wicked is based on their treatment of the "least of these."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, representing the faithful and the promise of God.

If we find a meaning in the "friend" of the parables of the Labourers in the Vineyard (see Note on <a href="/matthew/20-13.htm" title="But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do you no wrong: did not you agree with me for a penny?">Matthew 20:13</a>) and the Wedding Garment (see Note on <a href="/matthew/22-12.htm" title="And he said to him, Friend, how came you in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.">Matthew 22:12</a>), we ought not to ignore the thought that seems to be implied here. Here, too, was one who, even in Hades, was recognised as being, now more truly than he had been in his life, a "child" or "son of Abraham." (Comp. <a href="/luke/19-9.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, as much as he also is a son of Abraham.">Luke 19:9</a>.) The word used is the same, in its tone of pity and tenderness, as that which the father used to the elder son in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-31.htm" title="And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.">Luke 15:31</a>), which our Lord addressed to the man sick of the palsy (<a href="/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>), or to His own disciples (<a href="/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

Abraham here simply bids the tortured man to call to his memory the circumstances of the life he had lived on earth, telling him that in these circumstances he would find the reason for his present woeful state. It was no startling record of vice and crime, or even of folly, that the father of the faithful calls attention to. He quietly recalls to the rich man's memory that on earth he had lived a life of princely splendour and luxury, and that Lazarus, sick and utterly destitute, lay at his palace gate, and was allowed to lie there unpitied and unhelped. And because of the studied moderation of its language, and the everyday character of its hero Dives - for he, the rich man, not Lazarus, is the real hero, the central character of the great parable-lesson - the lesson of the parable goes home necessarily to many more hearts than it would have done had the hero been a monster of wickedness, a cold calculating or else a plausible villain, a man who shrank not from sacrificing the lives and happiness of his fellow-men if their lives or happiness stood in his way. Dives was merely a commonplace wealthy man of the world, with self-centred alms, and the sin for which he was condemned to outer darkness was only that everyday sin of neglecting out of the mammon of unrighteousness - in other words, out of his money - to make for himself friends who should receive him into the eternal tents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Abraham</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#940;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Abraam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_11.htm">Strong's 11: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham, progenitor of the Hebrew race.
