It suggests a deliberate action, emphasizing His awareness and intentional observation. In the context of the temple, Jesus often used His surroundings to teach important lessons. His looking up signifies a moment of teaching and revelation, drawing attention to what He is about to observe and comment on.<p><b>and saw the rich</b><br>The mention of "the rich" highlights a specific group of people who were present in the temple. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judea, wealth was often associated with social status and religious piety. The rich were expected to give generously to the temple, and their contributions were often public and visible. This sets the stage for a contrast between outward appearances and inward realities, a common theme in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>putting their gifts into the treasury</b><br>The treasury was a part of the temple where offerings were collected. It consisted of thirteen trumpet-shaped chests where people could deposit their contributions. The act of giving to the treasury was a religious duty, and it was customary for people to give alms as a sign of devotion. The public nature of this act allowed for social recognition, which could lead to giving for the sake of appearance rather than genuine worship. This scene sets up a comparison with the subsequent actions of the poor widow, highlighting the difference between giving out of abundance and giving out of sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is observing the actions of those around Him.
