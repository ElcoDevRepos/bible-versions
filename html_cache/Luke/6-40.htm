In the Jewish context of Jesus' time, rabbis were highly respected, and their disciples were expected to follow their teachings closely. This mirrors the relationship between Jesus and His followers, where He is the ultimate Teacher. The concept is also seen in the relationship between Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9-15</a>), where Elisha sought to emulate his mentor. The idea is that a disciple should not expect to surpass their teacher in wisdom or authority but should aim to learn and grow under their guidance.<p><b>but everyone who is fully trained</b><br>The process of being "fully trained" implies a period of learning, growth, and maturation. In the cultural context, this would involve rigorous study and practice, much like the training of a craftsman or an athlete. The Greek word used here for "fully trained" can also mean "perfected" or "complete," suggesting a thorough and comprehensive development. This training is not just intellectual but also moral and spiritual, aligning with the biblical call to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>will be like his teacher</b><br>The goal of discipleship is to become like the teacher, reflecting their character, values, and wisdom. For Christians, this means becoming more like Christ, who is the ultimate example of righteousness and holiness. This transformation is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>, which calls believers to walk as Jesus did. The process of becoming like the teacher involves both learning and imitation, as well as the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).

Jesus speaks to people who have willingly placed themselves under His instruction. They want to know His words and imitate His life. Similar moments fill the Gospels&#8212;think of Andrew and Peter leaving their nets (<a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a>) or Mary sitting at the Lord&#8217;s feet and listening to His teaching (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>). A disciple:<p>- Actively follows (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>: &#8220;If you remain in My word, you are truly My disciples&#8221;).<p>- Submits to authority (<a href="/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27</a>: &#8220;Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple&#8221;).<p>- Learns by relationship, not just by information (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>, Jesus &#8220;appointed twelve to be with Him&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is not above his teacher</b><p>Every classroom has a hierarchy: the teacher instructs, the student receives. Jesus restates that obvious order to emphasize humility. <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a> echoes, &#8220;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.&#8221; The point:<p>- Pride short-circuits growth (<a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>).<p>- Questioning is welcome; overturning the Teacher&#8217;s authority is not (<a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13&#8211;16</a>).<p>- Even Jesus, the Son, modeled submission to the Father (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>), showing that rightful authority is good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But everyone who is fully trained</b><p>&#8220;Fully trained&#8221; pictures a complete apprenticeship&#8212;tools mastered, character formed. Paul uses similar language: Scripture &#8220;trains&#8221; believers &#8220;so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>). Keys to full training:<p>- Consistent exposure to Scripture (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p>- Obedience in everyday choices (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>: &#8220;the mature&#8230; have their senses trained to distinguish good and evil&#8221;).<p>- Mutual sharpening inside the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be like his teacher</b><p>The goal is likeness, not superiority.

The connection of thought is somewhat obscure, and we may not unreasonably believe that some links have been omitted. As it is, however, we can infer something from what precedes and follows. We are still in that section of the discourse which warns the disciples against taking on themselves the office of a judge. They were in this to follow the example of their Master. He, in His work on earth, taught, but did not judge (<a href="/context/john/8-11.htm" title="She said, No man, Lord.
