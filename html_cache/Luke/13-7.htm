Vineyards were common in Israel, and the imagery of a vineyard is often used in the Bible to represent Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The keeper's role is to tend and care for the plants, reflecting God's patience and care for His people.<p><b>Look, for the past three years</b><br>The three years may symbolize the duration of Jesus' ministry on earth, during which He sought spiritual fruit from Israel. In Jewish law, fruit from a tree was not to be eaten for the first three years (<a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>), suggesting a period of expectation and patience.<p><b>I have come to search for fruit on this fig tree and haven&#8217;t found any</b><br>The fig tree often symbolizes Israel (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a>). The absence of fruit indicates a lack of repentance and righteousness among the people. Jesus frequently sought spiritual fruit, such as repentance and faith, from the people He ministered to.<p><b>Therefore cut it down!</b><br>This phrase indicates judgment. In the context of the parable, it suggests that without repentance, there will be consequences. This echoes John the Baptist's warning in <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a> about trees that do not bear good fruit being cut down.<p><b>Why should it use up the soil?</b><br>The fig tree's failure to produce fruit despite the resources and care it received highlights the theme of accountability. The soil represents the blessings and opportunities given by God.

Some expositors see in this period of three years an allusion to the storied past of Hebrew life, and in the number 3 discern the three marked epochs, each lasting several centuries, of the high priests, judges, and kings. This, however, is a very doubtful reference, owing to the impossibility of separating the first two periods of the rule of high priests and judges, as these interchange and overlap each other. Another school of interpreters sees a reference to the three years of the public ministry of Jesus. A better reference would be God's successive calls to Israel by the Law, the prophets, and by Christ. It is, however, safer, in this and m many of the Lord's parables, not to press every little detail which was necessary for the completion of the picture. Here the period of three years in which the Lord of the vineyard came seeking fruit, represents by the number 3 the symbol of complete-ness - a period of full opportunity given to the tree to have become fruitful and productive. <span class="cmt_word">Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</span> better rendered, <span class="accented">why doth it make the ground useless</span>?
