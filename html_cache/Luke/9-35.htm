The cloud represents the divine presence, reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and temple in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The voice from the cloud is God the Father, affirming Jesus' divine sonship and authority. This divine communication echoes the theophanies experienced by Moses and Elijah, who are also present at the Transfiguration, symbolizing the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>&#8220;This is My Son,</b><br>The declaration "This is My Son" affirms Jesus' unique relationship with God the Father, echoing the divine pronouncement at Jesus' baptism (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>). This phrase underscores Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the anointed king as God's Son. It also highlights the Trinitarian relationship within the Godhead, distinguishing Jesus as the second person of the Trinity.<p><b>whom I have chosen.</b><br>The phrase "whom I have chosen" emphasizes God's sovereign election of Jesus as the Messiah and Savior. This choice is rooted in the Old Testament concept of the chosen servant, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, where God speaks of His chosen servant who will bring justice to the nations. It underscores Jesus' mission and purpose, aligning with the divine plan of redemption. This selection is not based on human merit but on divine will and purpose.<p><b>Listen to Him!&#8221;</b><br>The command "Listen to Him!" directs the disciples, and by extension all believers, to heed Jesus' teachings and authority. This instruction places Jesus above Moses and Elijah, indicating that He is the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). It calls for obedience and attentiveness to Jesus' words, which are life-giving and authoritative. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a prophet like him whom the people must listen to, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate prophet and teacher.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, recognized as the Son of God.

The voice was evidently for the disciples - one more help for them in their present and future struggle against the cold and chilling doubts which ever and again would be suggested to them by the enemy of human souls, with a view to marring their present training, their future mighty missionary work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a voice</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(ph&#333;n&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5456.htm">Strong's 5456: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably akin to phaino through the idea of disclosure; a tone; by implication, an address, saying or language.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
