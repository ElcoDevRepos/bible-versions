In the cultural context of the time, sharing meals was a sign of fellowship and community, yet Lazarus was excluded from even the smallest portion. The imagery of "crumbs" suggests a lack of compassion and generosity from the rich man, who had more than enough to share. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the poor and marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which emphasizes kindness to the needy. The mention of "crumbs" also recalls the story of the Syrophoenician woman in <a href="/mark/7-28.htm">Mark 7:28</a>, where even the smallest act of mercy is significant. This phrase challenges readers to consider their own attitudes towards wealth and generosity.<p><b>Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</b><br>In the ancient Near East, dogs were often seen as unclean animals, scavengers that roamed the streets. The presence of dogs licking Lazarus's sores adds to the picture of his destitution and neglect. This act, however, can also be seen as a form of unintended compassion, as the licking of wounds by animals was believed to have healing properties. Theologically, this detail underscores the theme of reversal found throughout Luke's Gospel, where the last will be first and the first will be last (<a href="/luke/13-30.htm">Luke 13:30</a>). The dogs, considered lowly and impure, show more care for Lazarus than the rich man does. This phrase invites reflection on the nature of true compassion and the ways God can use unexpected means to provide comfort. It also serves as a foreshadowing of the ultimate reversal of fortunes that occurs in the afterlife, as described later in the parable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A poor man who lay at the rich man's gate, covered with sores and longing for scraps from the rich man's table.

The sentence unveils a man whose hunger is so severe that even scraps would seem a feast. Scripture consistently honors those who trust God amid poverty (<a href="/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20-21</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). Lazarus embodies this truth: he desires sustenance, yet endures his lack without complaint, trusting divine justice more than earthly provision. The rich man&#8217;s table overflows (cf. <a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>), but his neighbor receives nothing&#8212;an indictment of hardened hearts (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Crumbs from the Rich Man&#8217;s Table</b><p>Crumbs represent excess cast off without a second thought, underscoring the chasm between luxury and need (<a href="/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>). Notably, in <a href="/matthew/15-27.htm">Matthew 15:27</a> a Gentile woman believes even a crumb of grace is enough; here, Lazarus would settle for literal crumbs, yet none are offered. Jesus highlights a spiritual principle: withholding mercy reveals spiritual bankruptcy (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>). The rich man&#8217;s negligence contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s call to generous stewardship (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even the Dogs Came</b><p>&#8220;Even the dogs came&#8221; stresses Lazarus&#8217;s isolation. Dogs were viewed as unclean scavengers (<a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). Their presence signals that society has pushed Lazarus so low he shares space with animals rather than people. Where human compassion fails, creation itself draws near, exposing the callousness of those who should have helped (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a> subtly reminds us creation groans with us).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Licked His Sores</b><p>The dogs &#8220;licked his sores&#8221;, a striking picture. Ancient readers recognized open sores as a sign of extreme suffering (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7-8</a>). The licking may hint at a mild alleviation&#8212;animals offer the only comfort Lazarus receives&#8212;yet it primarily magnifies his misery. In contrast, the rich man enjoys gated security (<a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a>). God sees every wound, promising ultimate healing (<a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>), but the parable insists that those who follow Him must notice and respond to visible pain (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spiritual Implications</b><p><a href="/luke/16-21.htm">Luke 16:21</a> is not mere social commentary; it lays groundwork for the eternal reversal in verses 22-26. Earthly opulence without compassion leads to torment, while faithful endurance amid hardship is honored by God (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17-18</a>). The scene urges believers to recognize Christ in the needy (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>) and steward resources for kingdom purposes (<a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/16-21.htm">Luke 16:21</a> paints Lazarus as desperately hungry, satisfied with discarded crumbs, ignored by a self-indulgent neighbor, and attended only by stray dogs that soothe his sores. Jesus uses this vivid snapshot to condemn hard-hearted wealth and exalt persevering faith. The verse calls believers to notice suffering at their gates, share generously, and trust that God will one day reverse every inequity, rewarding those who live with compassion and humble dependence on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs.</span>--The habits of the East, the absence of knives and forks and the like, made the amount of waste of this kind larger than do the habits of modern Europe. (Comp. the language of the Syro-Ph?nician woman, in <a href="/mark/7-28.htm" title="And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.">Mark 7:28</a>.) Here the picture is heightened by two touches. The dogs are there, and get the crumbs, which the man fails to get, and then they come and lick the open sores. The question has been raised whether this touch is meant to intensify the sufferings of the beggar, or to contrast the almost human sympathy of the brute with the brutal apathy of the man. In a European apologue the latter might, perhaps, be a legitimate explanation of the fact thus stated; but with the Eastern feelings, that see in the dog an unclean beast, the scavenger of the streets, we cannot doubt that the beggar would have shrunk from their licking, even assuming, which is doubtful, that it brought with it some relief from merely physical pain. It may be noted, too, that the word for "dogs" is not the diminutive form used in <a href="/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>, and <a href="/mark/7-28.htm" title="And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.">Mark 7:28</a> (where see Note), which implied tameness, but that which is always associated with the idea of abhorrence (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>). . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">longing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epithym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1937.htm">Strong's 1937: </a> </span><span class="str2">To long for, covet, lust after, set the heart upon.
