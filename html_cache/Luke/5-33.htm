John the Baptist's disciples followed a strict ascetic lifestyle, reflecting John's prophetic call for repentance. The Pharisees, known for their strict adherence to the Law, also practiced fasting regularly, often twice a week, as a sign of piety. This comparison sets the stage for understanding the differing approaches to religious observance between Jesus and these groups.<p><b>but Yours keep on eating and drinking.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the contrast between Jesus' disciples and those of John and the Pharisees. Jesus' followers were noted for their participation in communal meals, which were significant in Jesus' ministry as symbols of fellowship and the coming kingdom of God. This behavior was perceived as unconventional and even scandalous by the religious leaders, who expected a more austere lifestyle.

These disciples of John do not seem at first to have regarded Jesus with altogether friendly feelings. Such a jealousy was only too natural, and the rigid, unbending truthfulness of the evangelists compelled them to tell the story of the way the early foundations of the truth were laid without concealment of error or mistake. The Baptist himself practised the sternest asceticism, and required doubtless of his nearest followers that they should imitate his example. The Lord's way of life, his presence at feastings and merry-makings, his consorting with publicans, his choice of one of them as his disciple and friend, no doubt surprised and disturbed not a few of the followers of John; hence such a question as the one we are now considering, and such a querulous complaining as we hear of in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="/john/3-25.htm">John 3:25, 26</a>). The practice of fasting among the Jews was as follows: In the Law of Moses only one appointed fast in the year was enjoined - that on the sole Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>). After the Exile the <span class="accented">one</span> fast was increased to <span class="accented">four.</span> But the prophets gave no sanction to this added ritual (see <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1-12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). In the time of our Lord, rigid Jews used to fast twice a week (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>) - on Monday and Friday (the day on which, according to tradition, Moses went up Mount Sinai). It is evident that our Lord himself never observed or even approved of these fasts of the Pharisee sect. In the well-known and often-quoted passages, <a href="/matthew/17-21.htm">Matthew 17:21</a>; <a href="/mark/9-29.htm">Mark 9:29</a>; <a href="/acts/10-30.htm">Acts 10:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a> - in many of the older authorities, <span class="accented">the word</span> 'fasting' <span class="accented">does not occur at all.</span> In the Revised Version in each of these instances "fasting" does not appear in the new text. While, then, we must unhesitatingly conclude that fasting is no rite commanded by the Blessed One, still the Church has practised it with signal advantage and profit on certain solemn occasions; but it must ever proceed from the impulse of the sorrow-stricken heart, it must be no penance or duty imposed by authority, least of all must it be regarded as pleasing in the eye of the Almighty, or in any sense a substitute for the practice of the higher virtues really loved of God - justice, mercy, and truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
