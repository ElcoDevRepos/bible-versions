Jesus' actions echo the prophetic tradition of condemning the misuse of religious spaces, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>, where the temple is called a "den of robbers." This cleansing of the temple is a type of Christ's role as the purifier of worship and the one who restores true devotion to God.

St. Luke apparently agrees with St. Matthew in thinking of the expulsion of the money-changers as taking place on the same day as the Entry. His narrative is here the least descriptive of the three.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went into the temple</span>. The recital of St. Luke here is more general and less precise than that of the other two synoptists. The Lord on that "Palm Sunday" evening simply went into the temple, ,, and when he had looked round about upon all things" it was then evening, and he returned to his lodging at Bethany with the twelve (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). The expulsion of the money-changers, mentioned in the next verse (46), took place on the following day. St. Matthew adds another interesting detail respecting the excitement caused by the presence of Jesus in the city. "When he was come into <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?" (<a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> This visit of the Lord to the temple, in which he spoke and acted as King Messiah, was a fulfilment of <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1, 2</a>. In the outer court of the temple stalls had been erected in which money-changers were located (<span class="accented">geld-wechsel comptoir</span> - <span class="accented">change de monnaies</span>), in order that pilgrims from foreign lands might be able to exchange their foreign coins for the purchase of sacrificial victims. These also seem to have been sold in the precincts. All this made the courts of the Lord's house a scene of noise and tumult, and, from the Master's stern words, a scene often of cheating and overreaching.
