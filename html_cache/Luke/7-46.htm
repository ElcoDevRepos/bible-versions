It was customary for a host to anoint the head of a guest with oil as a sign of welcome and blessing. This practice is seen in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where David speaks of God anointing his head with oil, symbolizing abundance and favor. The absence of this gesture by the Pharisee, Simon, highlights a lack of respect and recognition of Jesus' status. Anointing also had religious significance, often associated with consecration and the Holy Spirit, as seen in the anointing of kings and priests (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>but she has anointed My feet with perfume</b><br>The act of anointing Jesus' feet with perfume by the woman, traditionally identified as a sinner, is a profound demonstration of humility and devotion. Perfume, or ointment, was costly and often used sparingly, indicating the woman's sacrificial love and repentance. This act contrasts sharply with Simon's neglect and serves as a powerful symbol of worship and recognition of Jesus' divine authority. The use of perfume on Jesus' feet echoes the anointing of kings and foreshadows His burial, as seen in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3-7</a>, where Mary anoints Jesus' feet with nard. This act fulfills the prophetic imagery of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is anointed to bring good news, highlighting Jesus as the anointed one, the Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is at a Pharisee's house, teaching through His actions and words.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisee.htm">The Pharisee (Simon)</a></b><br>A religious leader who invited Jesus to his home, yet failed to show customary hospitality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinful_woman.htm">The Sinful Woman</a></b><br>An unnamed woman known for her sinful life, who anoints Jesus' feet with perfume as an act of repentance and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_simon.htm">The House of Simon</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a place where social and religious norms are challenged by Jesus' actions and teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing.htm">The Anointing</a></b><br>A significant act of devotion and humility, contrasting the Pharisee's lack of hospitality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_and_honor.htm">Hospitality and Honor</a></b><br>The Pharisee's failure to anoint Jesus' head reflects a lack of true hospitality and honor.

Simon literally failed to extend even this basic courtesy, exposing a heart that, while religiously strict, was spiritually indifferent toward Christ.<p>&#8226; Oil in Scripture often points to joy and consecration. By withholding it, Simon silently declared that Jesus was not worthy of special recognition&#8212;an attitude Jesus directly challenges (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s rebuke underscores that outward religiosity means nothing if it is not matched by genuine love and honor for Him (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but she has anointed My feet with perfume</b><p>&#8226; The unnamed woman, widely identified as a notorious sinner in the town, approaches Jesus in brokenness and faith (<a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37&#8211;38</a>). Instead of merely anointing His head, she goes lower&#8212;His feet&#8212;demonstrating humility and deep repentance (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> offers a similar scene with Mary of Bethany).<p>&#8226; The perfume was costly (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>). Pouring it out on Jesus&#8217; feet illustrated extravagant devotion; she held nothing back. Where Simon withheld inexpensive olive oil, she poured out precious fragrance.<p>&#8226; Kneeling at His feet fulfills the prophetic picture of sinners finding mercy at the Messiah&#8217;s feet (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/luke/8-35.htm">Luke 8:35</a>). Her outward act reveals an inward reality: she believes Jesus can and will forgive her sins.<p>&#8226; Jesus accepts her worship without rebuke, affirming both His divinity and His authority to forgive (<a href="/luke/7-48.htm">Luke 7:48&#8211;50</a>), something only God can do (<a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Simon&#8217;s omission and the woman&#8217;s action form a vivid, literal contrast between empty formality and heartfelt faith. The verse teaches that Christ looks past social standing to the posture of the heart. Neglecting even simple expressions of honor toward Jesus exposes spiritual coldness, while extravagant, humble love&#8212;even from the least esteemed&#8212;receives His full approval and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">My head with oil thou didst not anoint.</span>--This also, though not so common as the kiss and the washing of the feet, was yet a mark of courtesy due to an honoured guest. For one who had journeyed to a feast under the burning sun of Syria, it brought with it a sense of comfort and refreshment which made it a, fit type of spiritual realities. For the usage, see <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm" title="Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>. Partly because the use of oil or chrism became more directly symbolic in the ritual of the Christian Church--as in baptism, confirmation, extreme unction, the coronation of kings--partly because in other climates its necessity was not felt, the practice, as belonging to common life, has dropped into disuse. Note the contrast between the olive "oil," which was commonly used, and the more costly "ointment."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My head with oil</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment</span>. "It never entered thy thoughts to pay me the homage - and yet I had helped thee, too, a little - of pouring oil on my head" (this was by no means an unusual mark of respect in the case of an honoured guest; to one who, under the burning sun of Palestine, had walked, perhaps, some distance, this pouring oil over the head was a great comfort and refreshment); "but <span class="accented">she</span> hath anointed, not my head, she shrank, poor soul! from doing this; but my feet. And, too, it was no common oil which she used, but precious, fragrant ointment. A cold, loveless welcome, indeed, my Pharisee friend, was thine! Thou thinkest it honour enough the mere admitting the carpenter's Son to thy table; no need of these special tokens of friendship for thy Guest - the water for the feet, the kiss for the face, the oil for the head. It were a pity, surely, for the great world at Jerusalem to look on thee as the friend of the Nazareth Teacher, as on the one Pharisee who loved to honour the Galilaean Reformer." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You did not anoint</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#968;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;leipsas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_218.htm">Strong's 218: </a> </span><span class="str2">To anoint: festivally, in homage, medicinally, or in anointing the dead.
