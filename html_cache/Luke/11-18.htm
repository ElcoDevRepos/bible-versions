In the biblical context, Satan is often depicted as the adversary, the one who opposes God's work (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>, <a href="/zechariah/3.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>). The idea of division within Satan's ranks would imply a weakening of his power, which contradicts the notion of a strong, unified force of evil. Historically, division within a kingdom or organization often leads to its downfall, as seen in various biblical accounts such as the division of Israel into the northern and southern kingdoms (1 Kings 12).<p><b>how can his kingdom stand?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the absurdity of the claim that Jesus is casting out demons by Satan's power. A kingdom divided against itself is destined to fall, as seen in the fall of empires and nations throughout history. Theologically, this underscores the unity and singular purpose of God's kingdom in contrast to the chaos and disorder of Satan's realm. The imagery of a kingdom is used throughout scripture to describe both God's reign and the opposing forces of evil (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-25.htm">Matthew 12:25</a>).<p><b>After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</b><br>Beelzebul, often identified with Satan, is a name that carries connotations of idolatry and false gods (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2-3</a>). The accusation reflects the cultural and religious tensions of the time, where Jesus' miraculous works were met with skepticism and hostility by some religious leaders. This charge against Jesus is a reflection of the spiritual blindness and hard-heartedness that he often encountered (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). Theologically, this accusation is a direct challenge to Jesus' divine authority and mission, which he consistently demonstrated through his teachings and miracles (<a href="/matthew/9-32.htm">Matthew 9:32-34</a>, <a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the accusations made against Him by some of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>- Referred to as the adversary, whose kingdom is being discussed in terms of division and unity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beelzebul.htm">Beelzebul</a></b><br>- A name used for a demonic figure, often associated with Satan, whom the accusers claim Jesus is using to drive out demons.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- The people who are witnessing Jesus' miracles and are divided in their opinions about His power and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>- Spiritual beings that Jesus is casting out, demonstrating His authority over the spiritual realm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_kingdom.htm">Unity in the Kingdom</a></b><br>Just as a divided kingdom cannot stand, the Church must remain united in Christ to effectively advance His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_spirits.htm">Discernment of Spirits</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern the source of spiritual power, recognizing that true authority comes from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to cast out demons demonstrates His supreme authority over all spiritual forces.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/logical_consistency.htm">Logical Consistency</a></b><br>Jesus uses logical reasoning to refute false accusations, teaching us the importance of sound reasoning in defending our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Understanding the reality of spiritual warfare equips believers to stand firm in their faith and resist the enemy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_11_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 11:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_18_Unity_s_role_in_spiritual_war.htm">How does Luke 11:18 illustrate the importance of unity in spiritual warfare?

A kingdom cannot survive internal civil war.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays Satan as a real, personal being who marshals fallen angels against God&#8217;s people (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; He works with ruthless coherence: &#8220;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). If he suddenly started sabotaging his own forces&#8212;freeing people from demonic bondage&#8212;he would be tearing down everything he has built (<a href="/mark/3-23.htm">Mark 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; By setting up this obvious absurdity, Jesus shows the crowd that the charge against Him cannot stand on basic common sense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how can his kingdom stand?</b><p>Jesus presses the point: division spells doom for any realm.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;kingdom&#8221; of Satan is a dark counterfeit to God&#8217;s kingdom of light (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>). It is temporary, yet frighteningly organized (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even earthly empires collapse when racked by infighting&#8212;how much more an evil empire built on deception.<p>&#8226; So if the exorcisms people are witnessing truly came from Satan, his entire strategy would implode. The continuing oppression seen throughout the Gospels shows that is not happening (<a href="/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</b><p>Here Jesus finally names the accusation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Beelzebul&#8221; was a derisive title for Satan himself (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>). The religious leaders wanted to discredit Jesus&#8217; miracles without denying the miracles, so they labeled the source demonic (<a href="/luke/11-15.htm">Luke 11:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; reply unmasks their hard hearts. They prefer an impossible explanation over accepting that God is powerfully at work through His Son (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Every deliverance Jesus performs proves His superior authority: &#8220;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-18.htm">Luke 11:18</a> dismantles the claim that Jesus casts out demons by satanic power. If Satan were empowering Jesus to oust his own demons, he would be sabotaging his carefully ordered kingdom. The consistent, liberating ministry of Jesus reveals the opposite: God&#8217;s kingdom has invaded, the Stronger One is here, and evil cannot stand against Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub</span>. Throughout this argument Jesus assumes the existence of a kingdom of evil, all armed and thoroughly organized to carry out its dread purposes. He concedes, too, in language which admits of no questioning, the existence of a chief of this evil confederacy. Throughout his reply, the Master, while carefully bearing in mind the ability and skill of his enemies who had suggested this questioning to the people, addresses himself to the common sense of the mixed multitude who were present on this occasion. The argument is perfectly simple. It is not thinkable that the prince of evil would fight against himself, which he would be doing if he put such mighty weapons into Jesus' hands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
