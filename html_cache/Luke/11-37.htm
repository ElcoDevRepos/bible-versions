Inviting Jesus to dine was significant, as meals were important social and religious events. This invitation could have been an attempt to scrutinize Jesus or to engage Him in theological discussion. The Pharisees often opposed Jesus, but some were curious about His teachings.<p><b>so He went in</b><br>Jesus' acceptance of the invitation demonstrates His willingness to engage with all people, including those who were often His critics. This action reflects His mission to reach out to sinners and those in need of spiritual guidance, as seen in His interactions with tax collectors and other marginalized groups.<p><b>and reclined at the table</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, reclining at the table was a common practice during meals, especially formal ones.

They wished, no doubt, to get him away from the fast increasing crowd, and, when alone with him, they hoped to entangle him in a fresh discussion, and entrap him into some statement which they would be enabled subsequently to make use of, when they formally accused him of heretical, blasphemous teaching.
