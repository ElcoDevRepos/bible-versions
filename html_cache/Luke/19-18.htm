The parable is set in the context of Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, where He is teaching about the Kingdom of God. The servants represent followers of Christ, entrusted with responsibilities until His return. The act of coming to the master signifies accountability and the need to report on one's stewardship. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, which emphasizes faithfulness in managing what God has entrusted to us.<p><b>&#8216;Master, your mina has made five minas.&#8217;</b><br>The servant addresses the nobleman as "Master," acknowledging his authority and ownership. The term "mina" refers to a unit of currency in the ancient Near East, equivalent to about three months' wages. The servant's report of the mina making five minas indicates a 500% return on investment, demonstrating diligence and effective stewardship. This outcome highlights the principle of fruitfulness and multiplication found in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to be fruitful and multiply. The servant's success contrasts with the unproductive servant later in the parable, underscoring the importance of using one's gifts and resources for the Kingdom. This also echoes the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where faithful servants are rewarded for their productivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
