Upper rooms were common in Jewish homes, typically located on the second floor, providing privacy and a place for important events. This particular room was large enough to accommodate Jesus and His disciples, indicating the significance of the gathering. The use of an upper room is also seen in <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>, where the disciples gathered after Jesus' ascension, suggesting a place of fellowship and prayer. The room's size and location highlight the importance of the event that would unfold there, the institution of the Lord's Supper.<p><b>already furnished</b><br>The room being "already furnished" suggests that it was prepared in advance, possibly indicating divine providence in the arrangements for the Passover meal. This detail underscores the readiness and hospitality of the host, who may have been a follower of Jesus. The furnishings would have included the necessary items for a Passover meal, such as tables, cushions for reclining, and utensils. This preparation aligns with the Jewish custom of ensuring everything was in place for the Passover, a significant feast commemorating Israel's deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12). The readiness of the room reflects the meticulous planning and fulfillment of God's purposes.<p><b>Make preparations there.</b><br>Jesus instructs His disciples to "make preparations there," emphasizing the importance of the Passover meal they were about to share. This preparation involved procuring the lamb, unleavened bread, wine, and bitter herbs, all elements of the traditional Passover Seder. The directive to prepare highlights the disciples' role in participating in God's plan and the significance of the meal as a precursor to Jesus' impending sacrifice. The Passover itself is a type of Christ, symbolizing deliverance and redemption, with Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). This preparation sets the stage for the new covenant Jesus would establish through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is orchestrating the events leading up to the Last Supper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically, Peter and John, who are sent by Jesus to prepare the Passover meal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_carrying_a_jar_of_water.htm">The Man Carrying a Jar of Water</a></b><br>A sign given by Jesus to the disciples to identify the location of the Passover meal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>A significant location where the Last Supper takes place, symbolizing a place of fellowship and divine instruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A Jewish feast commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Jesus reinterprets in the context of His impending sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_preparation_and_provision.htm">Divine Preparation and Provision</a></b><br>God prepares the way for His purposes to be fulfilled.

That it perhaps belonged to St. Mark's family has also been suggested. It had evidently been prepared beforehand for the purpose of the feast, in obedience to a previous direction of Jesus. "Furnished" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,) applies specially to carpets spread over the couches for the reception of guests. "In this large upper chamber thus prepared," said the Lord, "make the necessary arrangements for the Paschal Supper; procuring and preparing the lamb, the unleavened bread, the herbs, and other customary dishes." It seems probable that this" large upper room," evidently belonging to a disciple, or at least to one friendly to Jesus, was the same room which, in the happier hours <span class="accented">after</span> the Resurrection, witnessed the appearance of the Risen to the eleven, and, later, the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kakeinos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2548.htm">Strong's 2548: </a> </span><span class="str2">And he, she, it, and that.
