The context is significant as it highlights Jesus' authority and compassion. The lepers were marginalized due to their condition, and Jesus' interaction with them demonstrates His willingness to reach out to the outcasts of society. This phrase also emphasizes the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, as He speaks directly to the individual, showing that He cares for each person personally.<p><b>Rise and go</b><br>This command signifies a change in the man's status. Previously, as a leper, he would have been required to live outside the community, but now he is being instructed to reintegrate into society. The act of rising is symbolic of new life and restoration, akin to resurrection themes found throughout the New Testament. It also reflects the authority of Jesus to command and bring about physical and spiritual transformation.<p><b>your faith has made you well!</b><br>This statement underscores the importance of faith in the healing process. While all ten lepers were physically healed, only this one is commended for his faith, which implies a deeper spiritual healing. The Greek word used here for "made you well" can also mean "saved," suggesting that the man's faith brought about not just physical healing but also spiritual salvation. This connects to other scriptural instances where faith is pivotal, such as in the healing of the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>) and the blind man (<a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>).

Jesus&#8217; words single him out for a personal encounter, highlighting that the Lord notices sincere gratitude.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows the Lord speaking directly to individuals as a sign of personal care (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because every word in Scripture is true, we can trust that Jesus&#8217; address is intentional, revealing both His compassion and His authority (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rise</b><p>&#8226; The command to &#8220;rise&#8221; signals that the man&#8217;s days of stooping in shame are over; he is to stand upright, restored in body and dignity.<p>&#8226; Similar moments: &#8220;Get up, take your mat and go home&#8221; to the paralyzed man (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>), and &#8220;Peter said, &#8216;In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!&#8217;&#8221; to the lame beggar (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; These commands demonstrate Jesus&#8217; power to reverse brokenness instantly and completely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Go&#8221; sends the healed leper back into normal life&#8212;back to family, community, and worship.<p>&#8226; Jesus often links healing with commissioning: &#8220;Go home to your own people and tell them what the Lord has done for you&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>), and the broader charge &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The man&#8217;s restored condition becomes his testimony.

The nine had had sufficient faith for the restoration of the health of their body; his had gone further, and had given a new and purer life to his soul.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> This was something more than the first noble gift, which he, in common with his nine fellow-sufferers, had received. A new power was his from that day forth. Closely united to his Master, we may think of the poor unknown Samaritan for ever among the friends of Jesus here and in the world to come. There are degrees in grace here. The nine had faith enough to believe implicitly in the Master's power, and in consequence they received his glorious gift of health and strength; but they cared to go no further. The one, on the other hand, struck with the majesty and the love of Jesus, determined to learn more of his Benefactor. From henceforth we may consider the Samaritan was one of "<span class="accented">his</span> own." SS. Luke and Paul gladly recorded this "<span class="accented">memory</span>," and no doubt not once or twice in the eventful story of their future lives used the incident as a text for their teaching when they spoke to the stranger Gentiles in far cities. Being a hated Samaritan, they would say, argued no hardness of heart, nor was it any bar to the bestowal of Jesus' most splendid gifts, first of life here, and then of life glorious and full in the world to come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
