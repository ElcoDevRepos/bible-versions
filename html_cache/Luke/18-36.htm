The mention of a "crowd" indicates Jesus' growing popularity and the anticipation surrounding His ministry. Crowds often followed Jesus, seeking healing, teaching, and miracles. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah drawing people to Himself (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>).<p><b>he asked what was happening</b><br>The man asking is identified in the context as a blind beggar, highlighting the social and economic challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in ancient times. Beggars often relied on almsgiving, a common practice in Jewish culture, as a means of survival. His inquiry shows his awareness and desire to understand the commotion, indicating hope and faith that something significant was occurring. This moment foreshadows the revelation of Jesus' identity and mission, as the blind man will soon recognize Jesus as the "Son of David," a messianic title affirming Jesus' royal lineage and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_beggar.htm">The Blind Beggar</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, a blind man sitting by the roadside, represents those who are marginalized and in need of Jesus' mercy and healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>This group of people is moving with Jesus as He approaches Jericho.
