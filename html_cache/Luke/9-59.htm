The call to "Follow Me" is a direct invitation to become a disciple of Christ, which involves leaving behind one's former life and priorities. This phrase echoes Jesus' earlier calls to His first disciples, such as Peter and Andrew (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The call to follow Jesus is not just a physical following but a spiritual commitment to His teachings and mission. In the cultural context of the time, following a rabbi meant dedicating oneself entirely to the rabbi's teachings and way of life.<p><b>The man replied, &#8220;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&#8221;</b><br>The man's response indicates a desire to fulfill familial obligations, which were highly regarded in Jewish culture. The phrase "bury my father" could imply that the father had recently died, or it could mean the man wanted to wait until his father died to follow Jesus, which could be an indefinite delay. In Jewish tradition, burial was a significant duty, and honoring one's parents was a commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). However, Jesus' call to follow Him often required prioritizing the Kingdom of God above all else, even above important cultural and familial duties. This passage challenges the reader to consider the cost of discipleship and the urgency of Jesus' mission. It also connects to other scriptures where Jesus emphasizes the need to prioritize the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>) and the cost of following Him (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, calling individuals to follow Him and prioritize His mission above all else.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_called_by_jesus.htm">The Man Called by Jesus</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who is invited by Jesus to follow Him but requests to fulfill familial obligations first.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_calling.htm">The Event of Calling</a></b><br>This is part of a series of interactions where Jesus emphasizes the cost and urgency of discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_discipleship.htm">The Urgency of Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus' call to "Follow Me" is immediate and requires a response that prioritizes His mission over personal and familial obligations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_following_jesus.htm">The Cost of Following Jesus</a></b><br>True discipleship may require difficult choices and sacrifices, including putting Jesus above family duties and societal expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>In the cultural context, burying one's father was a significant duty, yet Jesus challenges cultural norms to highlight the supreme importance of His call.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_the_kingdom_of_god.htm">Prioritizing the Kingdom of God</a></b><br>Followers of Christ are called to seek first the Kingdom of God, trusting that other responsibilities will be aligned according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The passage challenges believers to trust in Jesus' authority and wisdom, responding in faith and obedience even when it conflicts with personal plans.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_59_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:59?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_59_Priorities_in_following_Jesus.htm">How does Luke 9:59 challenge our priorities in following Jesus today?

Jesus personally commands, &#8220;Follow Me,&#8221; expecting immediate, wholehearted response. The would-be disciple&#8217;s request to &#8220;first&#8221; fulfill family obligations exposes a divided heart. While Scripture affirms honoring parents, it also insists that no relationship or responsibility outranks allegiance to Jesus. The passage challenges believers to place Christ above all else, respond without delay, and let nothing&#8212;however honorable&#8212;distract from the urgent work of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59, 60.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span> In this case the Master was the Summoner. Something he read in this man's heart, or words he had heard him speak, moved the Redeemer's great love, so he gave him a special call. This was a very different character from the last. Whereas <span class="accented">that</span> seeker for work from Jesus was impulsive, and even thoughtless in his enthusiasm, one who would begin to act without counting the cost, <span class="accented">this</span> one was overcautious, cold and calculating to an ungenerous excess; yet there was evidently sterling stuff in the character, for Jesus argues and remonstrates with him; there was, too, much gold mingled with the earth of that man's disposition, for the Lord lightly to let it go. It is thus that the Spirit pleads still with the selfishness which disfigures many a noble and devoted servant of high God. He seems to say, "My call is too imperative to yield to any home duties, however orderly and respectable." During the official days of mourning (in the case of a funeral, these were seven) the impression now made by his summoning words would have worn off. It is noticeable that the home duties, which Jesus suggested should give place to other and more imperative claims, were in connection with <span class="accented">the dead.</span> It was not the <span class="accented">living</span> father who was to be left to hirelings, only the inanimate corpse. It was rather a <span class="accented">society</span> call than a <span class="accented">home</span> or <span class="accented">family</span> duty which was to give place to work for the Master. St. Chrysostom makes some quaint, but strikingly practical, remarks here. "He might need, if he went to the funeral, to proceed, after the burial, to make inquiry about the will, and then about the distribution of the inheritance, and all the other things that followed thereupon; and thus waves after waves of things coming in upon him in succession might bear him very far away from the harbour of truth. For this cause, doubtless, the Saviour draws him, and fastens him to himself." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-59.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
