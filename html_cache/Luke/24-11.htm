In the first-century Jewish context, women were not considered reliable witnesses in legal matters, which may have contributed to the disciples' disbelief. This skepticism is also indicative of the broader human tendency to doubt miraculous events, as seen throughout Scripture. The Greek word translated as "nonsense" can also mean "idle talk" or "delirium," suggesting that the disciples thought the women were speaking irrationally. This reaction underscores the unexpected nature of the resurrection, despite Jesus' prior predictions (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 18</a>:33).<p><b>and they did not believe the women</b><br>The disbelief of the disciples highlights the cultural and historical context of the time, where women's testimonies were often undervalued. This moment also serves to emphasize the authenticity of the Gospel accounts; if the resurrection story were fabricated, it would be unlikely to feature women as the first witnesses. The disbelief contrasts with the faith of the women, who, despite societal norms, were the first to encounter the risen Christ. This theme of initial disbelief followed by eventual understanding and belief is a recurring motif in the Gospels, as seen in Thomas's doubt in <a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>. The disciples' eventual acceptance of the resurrection is a testament to the transformative power of encountering the risen Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>These are the women who visited Jesus' tomb and found it empty.

This reaction shows the depth of their shock and grief; sorrow had dulled their memory of Jesus&#8217; clear predictions of His resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; 18:31-34; cf. <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly portrays human frailty when confronted with divine intervention. When Sarah overheard God promise Isaac, she laughed (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>). When Rhoda announced Peter&#8217;s miraculous release, the believers said, &#8220;You are out of your mind&#8221; (<a href="/acts/12-15.htm">Acts 12:15</a>). These parallels underline how quickly even believers can dismiss God&#8217;s supernatural work.<p>&#8226; Yet the women&#8217;s words were true. Their experience anticipates Paul&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). The initial skepticism of the apostles highlights that the gospel rests on objective events, not gullible credulity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they did not believe the women</b><p>&#8226; Unbelief, not lack of evidence, kept the apostles from embracing the truth. <a href="/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11</a> confirms, &#8220;When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.&#8221; <a href="/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a> notes, &#8220;They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The resurrection is central to the faith. Paul later warns that if Christ has not been raised, our faith is futile (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). The apostles&#8217; initial refusal actually strengthens the case for the resurrection: these men did not invent the story; they were convinced against their expectations (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus graciously confronted their unbelief. He later appeared and rebuked them &#8220;for their unbelief and hardness of heart&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>). By personally showing His wounds (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39-40</a>), He transformed doubters into eyewitnesses empowered to proclaim the gospel (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The women&#8217;s faithful witness, despite dismissal, models perseverance. Like them, believers today testify to a risen Lord&#8212;even when the message seems foolish to a skeptical world (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a> records the disciples&#8217; knee-jerk dismissal of the women&#8217;s resurrection report. Their grief-blinded skepticism underscores human weakness, magnifies the factual reality of the empty tomb, and sets the stage for Christ&#8217;s own appearance that turns disbelief into unshakeable conviction. God&#8217;s Word proves true, and the risen Jesus still transforms hesitant hearts into bold witnesses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Idle tales.</span>--The one Greek word which is thus rendered occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.

The disciples were evidently amazed at their Master's rising from the dead. The chief priests and Jewish leaders would apparently have been surprised if something startling had not happened (see <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>, etc., where an account is given of the measures these able but unprincipled men took, in their short-sighted wisdom, to counteract any fulfilment of the Crucified One's word - a fulfilment <span class="accented">they</span> evidently looked forward to as to no improbable contingency). The utter surprise of the disciples at the Resurrection, which in their Gospels they truthfully acknowledge, is no small side-proof of the genuineness of these records of the event. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">words</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8165;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(rh&#275;mata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4487.htm">Strong's 4487: </a> </span><span class="str2">From rheo; an utterance, ; by implication, a matter or topic; with a negative naught whatever.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">seemed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ephan&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5316.htm">Strong's 5316: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prolongation for the base of phos; to lighten, i.e. Show.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#963;&#949;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5616.htm">Strong's 5616: </a> </span><span class="str2">As if, as it were, like; with numbers: about.
