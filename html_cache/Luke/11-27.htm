The context of this chapter shows that Jesus had been addressing issues of spiritual warfare, the nature of the kingdom of God, and the importance of hearing and obeying God's word. This setting is crucial as it highlights the authority and wisdom of Jesus' teachings, which often drew large crowds eager to hear His message.<p><b>a woman in the crowd raised her voice</b><br>The presence of a woman in the crowd who speaks out is significant in the cultural context of first-century Judea, where women typically held a more reserved role in public settings. Her boldness in raising her voice suggests a deep emotional response to Jesus' words, reflecting the impact of His teachings on individuals regardless of societal norms.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Blessed is the womb that bore You,</b><br>This statement reflects a common Jewish expression of blessing, emphasizing the honor and privilege of being the mother of someone as significant as Jesus. It echoes the cultural value placed on motherhood and lineage, which were highly esteemed in Jewish society. The woman's exclamation can be seen as an acknowledgment of Jesus' greatness and the blessedness of His mother, Mary, fulfilling the prophecy of Mary's blessedness found in <a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>.<p><b>and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!&#8221;</b><br>This continuation of the blessing further emphasizes the intimate and nurturing role of a mother. In the cultural context, it underscores the physical and emotional bond between mother and child, highlighting the honor of having raised someone of Jesus' stature. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision and care, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/66-11.htm">Isaiah 66:11-13</a>, where maternal imagery is used to describe God's comfort and sustenance for His people.<br><br>Overall, this verse captures a moment of spontaneous praise and recognition of Jesus' significance, while also pointing to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's blessed lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, teaching the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_in_the_crowd.htm">The Woman in the Crowd</a></b><br>An unnamed woman who speaks out, blessing Jesus' mother.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The group of people gathered around Jesus, listening to His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_jesus'_humanity_and_divinity.htm">Recognition of Jesus' Humanity and Divinity</a></b><br>The woman's blessing acknowledges Jesus' human birth, but believers are called to recognize His divine mission and teachings as paramount.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_blessedness.htm">True Blessedness</a></b><br>Jesus redirects the focus from His biological mother to those who hear and obey God's word, emphasizing spiritual obedience over physical lineage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_scripture.htm">The Role of Women in Scripture</a></b><br>This passage highlights a woman's voice in the crowd, reminding us of the significant roles women play in the biblical account and in the faith community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_and_obeying_god's_word.htm">The Importance of Listening and Obeying God's Word</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the woman's blessing underscores the importance of not just hearing but living out God's word in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_11_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 11:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_27_Hear_obey_God_s_word.htm">How does Luke 11:27 emphasize the importance of hearing and obeying God's word?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Motherhood_views_in_Jesus_era.htm">What does the woman's blessing reveal about cultural views of motherhood in Jesus' time?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_11_27_to_Matthew_5_Beatitudes.htm">How does Luke 11:27 connect with the Beatitudes in Matthew 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_spiritual_over_earthly_daily.htm">How can we prioritize spiritual blessings over earthly ones in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_inspire_focus_on_God_s_word_today.htm">In what ways can we encourage others to focus on God's word today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_27_Women_s_role_in_Jesus_work.htm">What does Luke 11:27 reveal about the role of women in Jesus' ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_27_Family_and_blessing_views.htm">How does Luke 11:27 challenge traditional views of family and blessing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_reply_that_way_in_Luke_11_27.htm">Why does Jesus respond to the woman's blessing in Luke 11:27 as He does?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_breastfeeding.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on breastfeeding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_dulia,_hyperdulia,_and_latria.htm">What are Dulia, Hyperdulia, and Latria?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_mary_the_mother_of_god.htm">Is Mary the mother of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_mary_called_queen_of_heaven.htm">Is Mary referred to as the Queen of Heaven?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 11:27 Mean</div><b>As Jesus was saying these things</b><p><a href="/luke/11-27.htm">Luke 11:27</a> opens in the middle of Jesus&#8217; teaching.

She is essentially echoing Elizabeth&#8217;s exclamation in <a href="/luke/1-42.htm">Luke 1:42</a>, &#8220;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that Jesus evokes personal responses&#8212;no one remains neutral (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Blessed is the womb that bore You&#8221;</b><p>The woman&#8217;s first phrase honors Mary for her unique role.<p>&#8226; Scripture affirms this blessing: Mary herself declares, &#8220;From now on all generations will call me blessed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet blessing Mary points beyond Mary to the Son she bore (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By praising Jesus&#8217; mother, the woman is confessing that Jesus is extraordinary; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a> calls children a &#8220;heritage from the LORD,&#8221; and this Child is the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!&#8221;</b><p>The second phrase extends the blessing to the nurturing Mary gave.<p>&#8226; It underscores Jesus&#8217; real humanity&#8212;He entered history through ordinary birth and infancy (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, Jesus immediately redirects: &#8220;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p>&#8211; He does not deny Mary&#8217;s blessedness (<a href="/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45</a>) but elevates obedience to God&#8217;s word as the truest source of blessing.<p>&#8211; This parallels <a href="/luke/8-21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>: &#8220;My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The statement guards against mere sentimentalism. Physical ties to Jesus&#8212;whether maternal, familial, or even national (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>)&#8212;are not what secure favor. Faith that results in obedience does.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-27.htm">Luke 11:27</a> records a sincere shout of praise that rightly honors Mary yet serves a deeper purpose. The woman&#8217;s words highlight Jesus&#8217; greatness, but Jesus&#8217; reply (verse 28) shifts the focus to the surpassing blessing of hearing and obeying God. Physical connections, even to Christ Himself, are secondary to spiritual submission. True blessedness is found not in proximity to holy things but in practiced obedience to God&#8217;s unchanging word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">A certain woman of the company.</span>--The incident is peculiar to St. Luke, and, like many other of the facts recorded by him, seems to have been derived from the company of devout women (<a href="/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1</a>; see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>) with whom he came into contact. It is interesting as being the first direct fulfilment of the words of the Magnificat, "All generations shall call me blessed" (<a href="/luke/1-48.htm" title="For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.">Luke 1:48</a>), and as showing how the Son of Mary in this instance, as in <a href="/context/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46-50</a>, extended the beatitude. There is at once a singular agreement in the manner in which each incident, embodying substantially the same lesson, follows on the parable of the Unclean Spirit, and a singular difference in the forms which the incident takes in the two narratives. A possible solution of the problem thus presented may be found in supposing the exclamation which St. Luke records to have been uttered by one of the women who was present when, as St. Matthew relates (<a href="/matthew/12-47.htm" title="Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.">Matthew 12:47</a>), one said unto Him, "Behold Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without . . ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked!</span> This woman seems to have expressed the popular feeling. The crowds who had seen the great miracle, had listened to the cavilling suspicions, and then heard the Master's wise and skillful reply, were evidently impressed with the wisdom as with the power of the famous but hated Teacher, for they no doubt echoed the lofty and sublime blessing of the woman here. She, perhaps, had in her own person experience of the two kinds of healing just contrasted by the Master; at all events, she had rightly comprehended his words. "How many women have blessed the holy Virgin, and desired to be such a mother as she was! What hinders them? Christ has made for us a wide way to this happiness, and not only women, but men may tread it - the way of obedience; this it is which makes such a mother, and not the throes of parturition" (St. Chrysostom). It has been ingeniously noticed that this is the first direct fulfillment of the "Magnificat" - "all generations shall call me blessed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
