This encounter occurs in the temple, a sacred space where Zechariah, a priest, is performing his duties. The appearance of an angel signifies a moment of divine intervention and communication, emphasizing the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>Do not be afraid, Zechariah</b><br>Fear is a common human reaction to angelic appearances, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>, <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>). The angel's reassurance to Zechariah reflects God's understanding of human emotions and His desire to comfort and encourage those He calls to serve Him. The personal address by name indicates a direct and intimate communication from God.<p><b>because your prayer has been heard</b><br>This phrase suggests that Zechariah had been praying for a child, as he and his wife Elizabeth were childless and advanced in years. It highlights the power of persistent prayer and God's faithfulness in answering prayers, even if the response comes after a long period. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God hearing and responding to the cries of His people (e.g., <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>).<p><b>Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son</b><br>The promise of a son to Zechariah and Elizabeth echoes other miraculous births in Scripture, such as Isaac to Abraham and Sarah (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Samuel to Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>). These instances often precede significant developments in God's redemptive plan, indicating that the child to be born will play a crucial role in God's purposes.<p><b>and you are to give him the name John</b><br>The name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious," reflecting the grace of God in granting Zechariah and Elizabeth a child. Naming in biblical times often carried prophetic significance, indicating the character or mission of the individual. John the Baptist's role as the forerunner to Jesus Christ is a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) and underscores the graciousness of God in preparing the way for the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, serving in the temple.

What was the nature of this prayer? The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) used here implies that some special supplication had been offered, and which the angel tells had been listened to at the throne of grace. The righteous old man had not, as some have thought, been praying for a son, - he had long resigned himself in this private sorrow to the will of his God; but we may well suppose that on that solemn occasion he prayed the unselfish patriotic prayer that the long looked for Messiah would hasten his coming. His name John; the shortened form for Jehochanan, "the grace of Jehovah." Under various diminutives, such as Jonah, it was a favorite Hebrew name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
