In biblical context, death is often seen as a transition rather than an end. The beggar, likely representing those who are poor in spirit, finds his earthly suffering concluded. This aligns with the Beatitudes, where Jesus blesses the poor and those who mourn (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-4</a>).<p><b>and was carried by the angels</b><br>This imagery suggests a divine escort, emphasizing the care God provides for His faithful even in death. Angels are often depicted as messengers and servants of God, playing roles in significant biblical events (e.g., <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). The presence of angels here underscores the beggar's righteousness and God's approval.<p><b>to Abraham&#8217;s side</b><br>Abraham is a patriarchal figure, representing the covenant and promises of God to His people (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Being at Abraham's side implies a place of honor and comfort, often interpreted as a metaphor for paradise or heaven. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the afterlife during Jesus' time, where the righteous would be gathered with the patriarchs.<p><b>And the rich man also died and was buried</b><br>The rich man's death is noted without the mention of angels, highlighting a stark contrast in their eternal destinies. Burial was a significant cultural practice, often elaborate for the wealthy, yet it underscores that earthly riches do not influence one's standing before God. This echoes Jesus' teachings on the dangers of wealth and the need for spiritual richness (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beggar.htm">The Beggar (Lazarus)</a></b><br>A poor man who suffered greatly in life, representing those who are humble and dependent on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>A wealthy individual who lived in luxury, symbolizing those who are self-reliant and neglectful of spiritual matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings who serve God and minister to His people, here depicted as carrying Lazarus to a place of comfort.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_side.htm">Abraham&#8217;s Side (Bosom)</a></b><br>A metaphorical place of honor and comfort in the afterlife, representing the blessings of being in God&#8217;s presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>The event that transitions both Lazarus and the rich man from earthly life to their respective eternal destinies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_eternal_destinies.htm">The Reality of Eternal Destinies</a></b><br>Our earthly status does not determine our eternal destiny.

Lazarus, though destitute in life, meets the same appointment as kings and merchants. His poverty did not negate his dignity before God (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>). The verse quietly reminds us that earthly circumstances do not dictate eternal destiny (<a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Life&#8217;s hardships end at death for the believer (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God notices the lowly and records their names (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carried by the angels</b><p>Rather than facing the journey alone, Lazarus enjoys angelic escort.

Scripture hints at similar heavenly assistance: Elijah taken up in a whirlwind (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), believers gathered at Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>), and angelic protection promised in <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>.<p>&#8226; The presence of angels underscores God&#8217;s personal care for His children (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their role at death assures us that nothing about a believer&#8217;s passing is random or neglected (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Abraham&#8217;s side</b><p>&#8220;Abraham&#8217;s side&#8221; (often &#8220;bosom of Abraham&#8221;) describes conscious fellowship and comfort among the redeemed. Jesus pictures Lazarus reclining at the same table as the father of faith&#8212;an image that echoes the future feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>). For the believer, to be &#8220;absent from the body&#8221; is to be &#8220;at home with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Immediate comfort follows death for those in covenant with God (<a href="/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of Abraham affirms continuity between Old Testament faith and New Testament promise (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the rich man also died</b><p>Wealth offers no exemption from mortality (<a href="/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16&#8211;17</a>).

Jesus had previously warned, &#8220;This very night your soul is required of you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly success cannot purchase eternal security (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Both men die, but their destinations differ&#8212;highlighting the decisive nature of faith, not fortune (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was buried</b><p>The text notes only the rich man&#8217;s burial, stressing the contrast between an impressive funeral and an impoverished eternity (<a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>).

Lazarus may have lacked a formal burial, yet he enjoys paradise, proving that divine approval outweighs human ceremony (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The grave closes earthly chapters, but judgment follows (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Without faith, even the most ornate tomb is empty hope (<a href="/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a> underscores two certainties: death is universal, and destiny is determined by relationship to God, not by earthly status. Lazarus moves instantly from misery to comfort, attended by angels and welcomed to Abraham&#8217;s fellowship. The rich man passes from luxury to mere burial, revealing the futility of wealth without faith. The verse calls us to trust God&#8217;s promise of eternal life, confident that He personally shepherds His people all the way home.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.</span>--Of the three terms in common use among the Jews to express the future state of blessedness--(1) the Garden of Eden, or Paradise; (2) the Throne of Glory; (3) the bosom of Abraham--this was the most widely popular. It rested on the idea of a great feast, in which Abraham was the host. To lie in his bosom, as St. John in that of our Lord's (<a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>), was to be there as the most favoured guest. And this was the position which was assigned to the beggar, obviously not merely as a compensation for the "evil things" he had endured on earth, but as the crown of the faith and patience with which he had borne them. The being "carried by angels" was literally in accord with the popular Jewish belief. Either good angels in general, or the special guardian angels of the righteous, took on them this office.<p><span class= "bld">The rich man also died, and was buried.</span>--As no mention is made of the burial of the beggar, it is obvious that there is something specially distinctive in the word. It had been, we may imagine, a stately burial, with hired mourners and all the pageantry of woe. such as within a few weeks, or even days, was to be the portion of the historic Lazarus of Bethany.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom</span>. At last kind death came, and relieved Lazarus of his sufferings. His <span class="accented">dismissal, as</span> might have been expected, preceded that of the rich man; for he was enfeebled by a deadly disease. We must not, of course, press too much the details we find in parables; still, from our Lord's way of speaking of the great change in the cases of both Lazarus and Dives, it would seem as though there was absolutely no pause between the two lives of this world and the world to come. The rich man evidently is pictured as closing his eyes upon his gorgeous surroundings <span class="accented">here</span>, and opening them directly again upon his cheerless surroundings <span class="accented">there.</span> Lazarus is described as being borne at once into Abraham's bosom. Indeed, some interpret the words as signifying that the body as well as the soul was carried by angels into Paradise. It is, however, better, with Calvin, to understand the expression as alluding only to Lazarus's soul; of the body of the pauper nothing was said, as men probably contemptuously, if not carelessly, buried it with the burial rites which such homeless, friendless ones too often receive. The place whither the blest Lazarus went is termed "Abraham's bosom." This term was used by the Jews indifferently, with "the garden of Eden," or "under the throne of glory," for the home of happy but waiting souls. <span class="cmt_word">The rich man also died, and was buried</span>. There is a terrible irony here in this mention of burial. This human pageantry of woe was for the rich man what the carrying by the angels into Abraham's bosom was for Lazarus - it was <span class="accented">his</span> equivalent; but while these empty honours were being paid to his senseless, deserted body, the rich man was already gazing on the surroundings of his new and cheerless home.
