Throughout Scripture, God often controls human perception to fulfill His purposes. In <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>, God reminds Moses that He is the one who gives sight. Similarly, in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, God tells Isaiah that the people's hearts will be hardened and their eyes closed. This divine action serves a greater purpose in God's redemptive plan, often to reveal deeper truths at the appointed time.<p><b>from recognizing Him</b><br>The inability of the disciples to recognize Jesus after His resurrection is significant. It highlights the transformed nature of Jesus' resurrected body, which, while physical, is also glorified and different from before (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>). This moment also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being unrecognized and despised. Theologically, this lack of recognition can symbolize spiritual blindness, a theme prevalent in the Gospels (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). It underscores the necessity of divine revelation for true understanding, as seen when Jesus later opens their eyes to recognize Him (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). This event foreshadows the spiritual awakening that occurs when believers come to faith in Christ, recognizing Him as Lord and Savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to the disciples on the road to Emmaus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus, one named Cleopas, who are traveling to the village of Emmaus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village approximately seven miles from Jerusalem, where the encounter takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city from which the disciples are departing, filled with recent events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>The setting of this significant post-resurrection appearance of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Even devoted followers can experience moments of spiritual blindness.

Cleopas and his companion have been pouring out their grief. Everything they thought they knew about Jesus has been shattered by the cross. But&#8212;God is about to pivot their despair.<p>&#8211; Throughout Scripture a &#8220;but&#8221; often signals divine intervention. Think of <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>: &#8220;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good,&#8221; or <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>: &#8220;But God, being rich in mercy&#8230;&#8221; The pattern teaches us to expect God to step in when circumstances look darkest.<p>&#8211; Application: when the sentence of life feels stuck on sorrow, watch for God&#8217;s gracious &#8220;but&#8221; that changes the storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their eyes</b><p>&#8211; The focus rests on perception, not physical sight. They can see a fellow traveler, yet they cannot perceive His true identity. Second Kings 6:17 offers a parallel when Elisha prays, &#8220;O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see,&#8221; and the servant suddenly beholds angelic armies.<p>&#8211; Spiritual eyesight comes from God. <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a> prays, &#8220;Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law.&#8221; The disciples&#8217; natural vision functions perfectly, but spiritual vision needs divine enabling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were kept</b><p>&#8211; The passive voice signals God&#8217;s sovereign action. He deliberately withholds recognition to teach them through Scripture before revealing Himself. <a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14-16</a> shows a similar pattern with Mary Magdalene: she doesn&#8217;t recognize Jesus until He speaks her name.<p>&#8211; This restraint protects a process. By walking them through Moses and the Prophets (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>), Jesus grounds their faith in the written Word rather than a fleeting visual encounter. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;So faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from recognizing Him</b><p>&#8211; Recognition arrives later, &#8220;their eyes were opened and they recognized Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). The sequence underlines that true knowledge of Christ depends on revelation. <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a> echoes the point: &#8220;Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father in heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The withheld recognition exposes the insufficiency of human reasoning. They had all the facts&#8212;reports from the women, an empty tomb&#8212;yet could not assemble them correctly. First Corinthians 2:14 notes, &#8220;The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God&#8230; they are spiritually discerned.&#8221;<p>&#8211; When recognition finally breaks through, their hearts burn within them (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), demonstrating that the warmth of conviction follows the opening of spiritual eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a> highlights God&#8217;s sovereign control over spiritual perception. In love, He momentarily veils Jesus&#8217; identity to ground the disciples&#8217; faith in Scripture, not sight. Their temporary blindness turns the coming revelation into a life-changing moment that anchors them&#8212;and us&#8212;on the certainty that true understanding of Christ is always a gift God graciously grants through His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.</span> So Mary Magdalene looked on and failed to recognize at first the Person of her adored Master (<a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>). So by the lake-shore, as he stood and spoke to the tired fishermen, they who had been so long with him knew him not. Some mysterious change had been wrought in the Person of the Lord. Between the Resurrection and the Ascension, men and women now looked on him without a gleam of recognition, now gazed on him knowing well that it was the Lord. "It is vain," writes Dr. Westcott, "to give any simply natural explanation of the failure of the disciples to recognize Christ. After the Resurrection he was known as he pleased, and not necessarily at once Till they who gazed on him were placed in something of spiritual harmony with the Lord, they could not recognize him." The two on their walk to Emmaus, and Mary Magdalene in the garden, were preoccupied with their sorrow. The fisher-disciples on the lake were preoccupied with their work, so that the vision of the Divine was obscured. The risen Christ will surely fulfil his own words, "The pure in heart, they shall see God" <span class="accented">but only the pure in heart.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
