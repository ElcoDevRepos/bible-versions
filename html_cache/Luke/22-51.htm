This command from Jesus emphasizes His commitment to non-violence and His mission of peace, even in the face of betrayal and arrest. It reflects His teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>) about turning the other cheek and underscores His role as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). This phrase also highlights Jesus' authority and control over the situation, as He intervenes to stop further violence.<p><b>And He touched the man&#8217;s ear and healed him.</b><br>This miraculous healing is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' compassion and divine power even towards those who came to arrest Him. The act of healing Malchus, the servant of the high priest, is unique to Luke's Gospel, which often emphasizes Jesus' concern for individuals and His healing ministry. This miracle serves as a final public act of healing before His crucifixion, symbolizing His mission to restore and reconcile. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's wounds bringing healing.
