In the context of <a href="/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a>, Jesus is addressing His disciples, providing them with guidance on faith and forgiveness. The title "Lord" underscores His divine authority and the respect He commands from His followers.<p><b>If you have faith the size of a mustard seed</b><br>The mustard seed is known for its small size, symbolizing the potential of even the smallest amount of genuine faith. In Jewish culture, the mustard seed was often used proverbially to represent something very small. This imagery highlights the power of faith, not in its quantity, but in its quality and the object of that faith&#8212;God. The mustard seed metaphor is also found in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, reinforcing the teaching across the Gospels.<p><b>you can say to this mulberry tree</b><br>The mulberry tree, likely the black mulberry common in the region, is known for its deep roots and resilience. This makes the imagery of uprooting it even more striking, illustrating the seemingly impossible tasks that can be accomplished through faith. The choice of a mulberry tree may also reflect its cultural significance and familiarity to Jesus' audience.<p><b>&#8216;Be uprooted and planted in the sea,&#8217;</b><br>This hyperbolic statement emphasizes the miraculous power of faith. The sea, often representing chaos and the unknown in biblical literature, serves as a backdrop for demonstrating God's sovereignty over creation. The act of planting a tree in the sea is naturally impossible, underscoring the supernatural possibilities available through faith in God.<p><b>and it will obey you.</b><br>This conclusion assures believers of the effectiveness of faith when aligned with God's will. The obedience of the tree symbolizes the submission of creation to divine authority, echoing themes found in other scriptures where nature responds to God's command, such as Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.

The "sycamine tree" (probably not the same as the "sycamore," but identified by most botanists with the mulberry tree, still cultivated on the slopes of the Lebanon and in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and Nablous, both for its fruit and as supplying food for silkworms) takes the place of "this mountain," <span class= "ital">sc.</span> Hermon, as an illustration of what true faith could do. If we suppose the conversation to have taken place near the Sea of Galilee, both features of the comparison gain a local vividness. It is remarkable that our Lord meets the prayer with what sounds like a reproof; and such a reproof, we must believe, was needed. The most elementary faith would have been enough to teach them (assuming the connection that has been traced above) that God is love, and that He would help them to overcome all hindrances to their love being after the pattern of His own. There was something, it may be, false in the ring of that prayer, an unreal diffidence asking for that as a gift which really comes only through active obedience and the experience which is gained through it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you</span>. The Lord signifies that a very slight <span class="accented">real</span> faith, which he compares to the mustard seed, that smallest of grains, would be of power sufficient to accomplish what seemed to them impossible. In other words, he says, "If you have any real faith at all, you will be able to win the victory over yourselves necessary for a perpetual loving judgment of others." The sycamine tree here mentioned in his comparison is not the sycamore; he was probably standing close by the tree in question as he spoke. The sycamine is the black mulberry, Morns <span class="accented">nigra</span>, still called <span class="accented">sycamenea</span> in Greece. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
