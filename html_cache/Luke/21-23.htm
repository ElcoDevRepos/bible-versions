In the context of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, such individuals would have faced extreme hardship due to the siege and subsequent famine. The phrase underscores the severity of the situation, as pregnant and nursing mothers would struggle to find food and safety for themselves and their children. This reflects the broader biblical theme of compassion for the vulnerable, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd caring for his flock, including nursing ewes.<p><b>For there will be great distress upon the land</b><br>The "land" refers to the region of Judea, particularly Jerusalem, which faced devastation during the Roman siege. This distress is not only physical but also spiritual, as the Jewish people faced the consequences of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. The phrase echoes Old Testament prophecies of judgment, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>, which speaks of a time of trouble for Jacob. The distress is a fulfillment of Jesus' earlier warnings in <a href="/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43-44</a>, where He foretold the encirclement and destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>and wrath against this people.</b><br>The "wrath" signifies divine judgment upon the Jewish nation for their unbelief and rejection of Christ. This concept of divine wrath is consistent with the Old Testament, where God's judgment often comes upon His people for their disobedience, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and mercy, where judgment serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of the need for salvation through Christ. This wrath is not arbitrary but is a response to the covenantal unfaithfulness of the people, as outlined in the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pregnant_and_nursing_mothers.htm">Pregnant and Nursing Mothers</a></b><br>This group is highlighted to emphasize vulnerability and the severity of the coming distress.

This is the geographical area where the predicted events will unfold.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/this_people.htm">This People</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, who are the primary audience of Jesus' prophecy.
