Historically, this event was marked by significant bloodshed, as Roman forces, led by General Titus, breached the city walls and slaughtered many inhabitants. The "edge of the sword" is a common biblical expression denoting violent death in battle, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>.<p><b>and be led captive into all the nations.</b><br>Following the fall of Jerusalem, many Jews were taken as captives and dispersed throughout the Roman Empire. This dispersion, or Diaspora, fulfilled prophecies such as those found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, where God warned of scattering His people among the nations due to disobedience. The historical context of this dispersion is crucial, as it led to the widespread presence of Jewish communities across the Mediterranean and beyond, influencing both Jewish and Christian history.<p><b>And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles,</b><br>The phrase "trodden down" suggests domination and control by foreign powers. After the destruction of Jerusalem, the city came under Gentile rule, first by the Romans and later by various other empires, including the Byzantines, Muslims, Crusaders, and Ottomans. This period of Gentile control is significant in biblical prophecy, as it indicates a time when Jerusalem would not be under Jewish sovereignty, aligning with prophecies in <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26-27</a> and <a href="/zechariah/12-3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>.<p><b>until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</b><br>This phrase indicates a prophetic timeline during which Gentile nations would have dominion over Jerusalem. The "times of the Gentiles" is a concept that suggests a divinely appointed period where Gentile influence prevails, which is echoed in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>, where Paul speaks of a partial hardening of Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. The fulfillment of this period is often associated with eschatological events, pointing to a future restoration and redemption of Israel, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14:1-4</a> and <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city central to Jewish identity and worship, significant in biblical prophecy and history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people, often seen in the Bible as those outside the covenant community of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivity.htm">Captivity</a></b><br>Refers to the dispersion of the Jewish people among the nations, a recurring theme in Jewish history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_edge_of_the_sword.htm">The Edge of the Sword</a></b><br>A phrase indicating warfare and destruction, often used in biblical contexts to describe divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_times_of_the_gentiles.htm">The Times of the Gentiles</a></b><br>A prophetic period during which Gentile nations have dominion over Jerusalem, awaiting fulfillment in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Understanding Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' prophecy about Jerusalem's destruction and the times of the Gentiles has historical and future implications.

It is computed that 1,100,000 Jews perished in the terrible war when Jerusalem fell (A.D. 70). Renan writes of this awful slaughter, "that it would seem as though the whole (Jewish) race had determined upon a rendezvous for extermination." <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles</span>. After incredible slaughter and woes, Titus, the Emperor Vespasian's son, who commanded the Roman armies, ordered the city (of Jerusalem) to be razed so completely as to look like a spot which had never been inhabited (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' v. 10. &sect; 5). The storied city has been rebuilt on the old site - <span class="accented">but without the temple</span> - and since that fatal day, more than eighteen centuries ago, no Jew save on bare sufferance has dwelt in the old loved and sacred spot. In turn, Roman and Saracen, Norseman and Turk, have trodden Jerusalem down. Literally, indeed, have the sad words of Jesus been fulfilled<span class="cmt_word">. Until the times of the Gentiles</span> <span class="cmt_word">be fulfilled.</span> These few words carry on the prophecy past our own time (how far past?) - carry it on close to the days of the end. "The times of the Gentiles" signify the whole period or epoch which must elapse between the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, and the beginning of the times of the end when the Lord will return. In other words, these "times of the Gentiles" denote the period during which they - the Gentiles - hold the Church of God in place of the Jews, deposal from that position of favor and honor. These words separate the prophecy of Jesus which belongs solely to the ruin of the cry and temple from the eschatological portion of the same prophecy. <span class="accented">Hitherto</span> the Lord's words referred solely to the fall of Jerusalem and the ruin of the Jewish race.
