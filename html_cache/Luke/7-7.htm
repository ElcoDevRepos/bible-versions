In the cultural context of Roman-occupied Judea, a centurion was a man of authority and power, yet he acknowledges his unworthiness before Jesus, a Jewish teacher. This reflects a deep respect and recognition of Jesus' divine authority. The centurion's attitude contrasts with the typical Roman view of superiority over the Jewish people, highlighting a significant shift in understanding and faith. This humility is reminiscent of the attitude encouraged in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up."<p><b>But just say the word,</b><br>The centurion's faith in Jesus' power is profound. He believes that Jesus' spoken word alone is sufficient to heal, without the need for physical presence or touch. This reflects an understanding of Jesus' divine authority over creation, similar to God's creative power in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the world into existence. The centurion's faith is a model of belief in the power of God's word, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, which states that the universe was formed at God's command.<p><b>and my servant will be healed.</b><br>The centurion's confidence in Jesus' ability to heal from a distance demonstrates a remarkable faith that transcends cultural and religious boundaries. This belief in Jesus' healing power is consistent with the miracles recorded throughout the Gospels, where Jesus heals the sick, restores sight to the blind, and even raises the dead. The centurion's faith is commended by Jesus in the following verses, highlighting the importance of faith in receiving God's blessings. This healing also prefigures the spiritual healing and salvation that Jesus offers to all who believe, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "By His wounds we are healed."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Luke, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer commanding a hundred soldiers, demonstrating faith and humility in seeking Jesus' help for his servant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>The centurion's valued servant who is ill and in need of healing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performs many miracles, including the healing of the centurion's servant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_elders.htm">Jewish Elders</a></b><br>Representatives of the Jewish community who intercede on behalf of the centurion, showing his good relationship with the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_sight.htm">Faith Beyond Sight</a></b><br>The centurion's faith is remarkable because he believes in Jesus' power without needing Him to be physically present.

The word the Master would speak would be enough; the result he willed would assuredly follow. "Do not come hither where my servant is, but only <span class="accented">speak here</span> where thou art." The centurion had a just notion of Christ's power.
