Leprosy, a term used for various skin diseases, rendered individuals ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (Leviticus 13-14). The healing of lepers was a sign of the Messiah's arrival, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. Jesus' question underscores the completeness of His miracle, as all ten were physically healed. This reflects God's grace, which is extended to all, regardless of their response.<p><b>Jesus asked.</b><br>The act of Jesus asking a question is a common teaching method used throughout the Gospels. It invites reflection and self-examination. Here, Jesus' question serves to highlight the ingratitude of the nine lepers who did not return to give thanks. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and responding to God's work in one's life. This method of questioning is reminiscent of God's interactions with humanity throughout Scripture, such as when God questioned Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>.<p><b>Where then are the other nine?</b><br>This question points to the lack of gratitude and acknowledgment from the nine lepers who were healed. In Jewish culture, gratitude was an expected response to acts of kindness, especially divine intervention. The absence of the nine highlights a spiritual lesson about the importance of thankfulness and the recognition of God's blessings. This moment also foreshadows the broader rejection of Jesus by many of His own people, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where it states, "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him." The one who returned, a Samaritan, represents the unexpected recipients of God's grace, aligning with the theme of the Gospel reaching beyond the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of healing the ten lepers.

Scripture warns that in the last days people will be &#8220;ungrateful&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>), forgetting the Giver while enjoying His gifts (<a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving completes the circle of blessing (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>).

All ten tasted mercy; only one returned to honor the Merciful. The verse presses us to move beyond receiving blessings to voicing gratitude, beyond physical relief to saving faith. Christ&#8217;s questions still echo, inviting every healed soul to draw near, give glory, and live in thankful communion with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Were there not ten cleansed?</span>--There is, it is clear, a tone of mingled surprise, and grief, and indignation, in the question thus asked. Looking to the facts of the case, an ethical question of some difficulty presents itself. If the nine had had faith to be healed--and the fact that they were healed implies it--how was it that faith did not show itself further in gratitude and love? The answer is to be found in the analogous phenomena of the spiritual life which are found at times in cases that are as the cleansing of the soul's leprosy. Men have the faith which justifies; they are pardoned, and they have the sense of freedom from the burden and the disease of sin, and yet their lives show no glow of loving gratitude. They shrink from fellowship with those who, having been sharers in the same blessing with themselves, are separated from them by outward lines of demarcation. We may, perhaps, think, without being over-bold, of the twelve disciples of the Baptist, who continued in their separatist life at Ephesus, without knowing the warmth and love and joy of the indwelling of the Spirit, as presenting such analogous phenomena. (See Notes on <a href="/context/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1-7</a>.) The history of most churches or smaller religious societies, perhaps also that of most individual men, presents many more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are the nine?</span> It has been suggested that the priests, in their hostility to Jesus, hindered the return of the nine. The one who was a Samaritan would naturally pay little heed to a remonstrance from such a quarter. From the terms of the narrative it is, however, more likely that the strange Samaritan, as soon as he felt he was really cured, moved by intense, adoring gratitude, at once turned back to offer his humble, heartfelt thanks to his Deliverer. The others, now they had got what they so earnestly required, forgot to be grateful, and hurried off to the priests to procure their certificate of health, that they might plunge at once again into the varied distractions of everyday life - into business, pleasure, and the like. The Master appears especially moved by this display. He seems to see in the thanklessness of the nine, contrasted with the conduct of the one, the ingratitude of men as a whole, "as a prophetic type of what will also ever take place" (Stier). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;{Were} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#967;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouchi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3780.htm">Strong's 3780: </a> </span><span class="str2">By no means, not at all.
