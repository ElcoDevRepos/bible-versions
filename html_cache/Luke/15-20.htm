The prodigal son, having realized his dire situation, chooses to return to his father, symbolizing a sinner's repentance and turning back to God. This act of getting up signifies a change of heart and a willingness to seek forgiveness. In biblical context, repentance is often depicted as a return to God, as seen in the stories of Israel's return to the Lord after periods of disobedience (e.g., <a href="/hosea/6.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>). The act of going to the father also reflects the biblical theme of reconciliation and restoration.<p><b>But while he was still in the distance, his father saw him and was filled with compassion.</b><br>The father's ability to see his son from a distance suggests a watchful and hopeful anticipation, reflecting God's omniscience and readiness to receive repentant sinners. The father's compassion is a central theme, illustrating God's loving and merciful nature. In the cultural context of the time, a father showing such emotion and eagerness would have been countercultural, as patriarchal figures were expected to maintain dignity and reserve. This compassion aligns with other scriptural depictions of God's mercy, such as in <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, where God is described as a compassionate father.<p><b>He ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.</b><br>The father's actions break with cultural norms, as running was considered undignified for an elder. This eagerness to reconcile highlights the depth of God's love and grace. The embrace and kiss are signs of acceptance and forgiveness, symbolizing the complete restoration of the relationship. This mirrors the reconciliation offered through Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>, where God reconciles the world to Himself through Jesus. The father's actions can also be seen as a type of Christ, who actively seeks and saves the lost, as described in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>Represents a sinner who has strayed from God but decides to return in repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Symbolizes God the Father, who is loving, compassionate, and eager to forgive.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey_home.htm">The Journey Home</a></b><br>The son's decision to return signifies repentance and the journey back to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_embrace_and_kiss.htm">The Embrace and Kiss</a></b><br>Demonstrates the father's (God's) unconditional love and acceptance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_distant_view.htm">The Distant View</a></b><br>Indicates the father's anticipation and readiness to forgive, even before the son arrives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_readiness_to_forgive.htm">God's Readiness to Forgive</a></b><br>God is always ready to forgive and welcome us back, no matter how far we have strayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a change of heart and a decision to return to God, as demonstrated by the prodigal son.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unconditional_love.htm">Unconditional Love</a></b><br>God's love is unconditional and not based on our past actions.

In the interpretation, the state of the penitent is that of one who is poor in spirit, hungering and thirsting after righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>), with knees that are feeble and hands that hang down (<a href="/hebrews/12-12.htm" title="Why lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;">Hebrews 12:12</a>), conscious of his nakedness and needing something else than the "filthy rags" of his own righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm" title="But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.">Isaiah 64:6</a>) to cover it. And he is yet "a great way off"--not as yet near the home of peace, the light of the Father's countenance--but even there, there comes to him the joy of all joys, the love of the Father finds him, and he is conscious of the love. There is the contact of his soul with the Divine Presence which answers to the Father's kiss.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and came to his father</span>. And so he came safe home; sad, suffering, ragged, destitute, but still safe. But, in spite of this, the parable gives scant encouragement indeed to sin, poor hope indeed to wanderers from the right way, like the hero of our story; for we feel that, though he escaped, yet many were left behind in that sad country. We dimly see many other figures in the picture., The employer of the prodigal was a citizen, but only one of many citizens. The prodigal himself was a servant - one, though, of a great crowd of others; and of all these unhappy dwellers in that land of sin, we only read of <span class="accented">one coming out.</span> Not an encouraging picture at best to any soul purposing deliberately to adventure into that country, with the idea of enjoying the pleasant licence of sin for a season and there coming home again. Such a home-coming is, of course, possible - the beautiful story of Jesus tells us this; but, alas I how many stay behind! how few come out thence! <span class="cmt_word">But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him</span>. But although many who wander never escape from that sad country, it is not because they would be unwelcomed should they choose to return. The whole imagery of this part of the parable tells us how gladly the eternal Father welcomes the sorrowful penitent. The father does not wait for the poor wanderer, but, as though he had been watching for him, sights him afar off, and at once takes compassion, and even hastens to meet him, and all is forgiven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he got up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anastas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
