In first-century Jewish society, women were not considered reliable witnesses in legal matters. However, the Gospels consistently record women as the first to discover the empty tomb, underscoring the authenticity of the resurrection accounts. This also reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, where women played crucial roles. The term "astounded" indicates the unexpected and shocking nature of the news they brought, which was beyond the disciples' understanding and expectations.<p><b>They were at the tomb early this morning,</b><br>The mention of the women being at the tomb "early this morning" emphasizes their devotion and eagerness to care for Jesus' body, as they intended to anoint it with spices. This detail aligns with Jewish burial customs, where bodies were anointed to honor the deceased and mitigate the odor of decay. The timing also fulfills the prophecy of Jesus rising on the third day, as He had foretold (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>). The early morning visit signifies the dawn of a new era, symbolizing the light of the resurrection dispelling the darkness of death. The location of the tomb, traditionally identified as the Garden Tomb or the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, remains a significant site for Christian pilgrimage, reflecting the historical and spiritual importance of the resurrection event.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_at_the_tomb.htm">Women at the Tomb</a></b><br>These women were followers of Jesus who went to His tomb early in the morning to anoint His body with spices, as was the custom.
