It holds significant biblical importance as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11). This location is symbolic, as it represents a place of friendship and hospitality for Jesus. Leading the disciples to Bethany signifies a transition from His earthly ministry to His ascension. The Mount of Olives is also prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> as the place where the Lord will stand in the end times, highlighting its eschatological significance.<p><b>He lifted up His hands</b><br>Lifting hands is a traditional Jewish gesture of blessing and prayer, seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a>, where Aaron lifts his hands to bless the people). This act signifies Jesus' role as the High Priest, interceding for His followers. It also symbolizes the impartation of divine favor and grace upon the disciples, preparing them for their mission to spread the Gospel.<p><b>and blessed them.</b><br>The blessing Jesus imparts is both a farewell and a commissioning. It echoes the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, which invokes God's protection, grace, and peace. This blessing is a precursor to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, empowering the disciples for their mission.

We must remember, however, that even the coincidences between the close of St. Luke's first book and the beginning of his second, show that he was already looking forward to resuming his work, and that the interval of forty days is distinctly recognised in <a href="/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a>, though there also, as here, there is no mention of any return to Galilee in the interval. Is it a conceivable solution of the problem that the devout women, who were St. Luke's informants, remained at Jerusalem in almost entire seclusion, and hardly knew of what had passed outside the walls of their house from the day of the Resurrection onwards to that of the Ascension? To them, as to others who look back upon periods in which intense sorrow and intense joy have followed one on the other, all may have seemed, when they looked back upon it in after years, as a dream, the memory of which was in one sense, as to its outcome, indelible, but in which the sequence of details could no longer be traced with clearness. If we may distinguish between two words often used as synonymous, it was with them, not recollection, but memory. On the brief narrative that follows, see Notes on <a href="/context/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9-11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50-53.</span> - THE ASCENSION. In considering the questions which suggest themselves in connection with the ascension of our blessed Lord, we are met on the threshold with the fact that only St. Luke, in his Gospel in this place, and in the Acts (1.), has given us a detailed account of the scene. But the fact is referred to <span class="accented">plainly</span> by St. John (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>; <a href="/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>) and by St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9, 10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>). A vast number of passages besides, in the Epistles of SS. Paul, Peter, and James, and in the Revelation of St. John, presuppose the Ascension, when they describe the heavenly glory of Jesus and of his session at the right hand of God. St. John's triple mention of the Ascension (see above) is exactly in accordance with his constant practice in his Gospel; he avoids rewriting a formal narrative of things which, when he wrote, were well known i, the Churches; yet he alludes to these things in clear and unmistakable language, and draws from them his lessons and conclusions. Notably this is the case in the Fourth Gospel with regard to the sacraments. "It contains," says Dr. Westcott, "no formal narrative of the institution of sacraments, and yet it presents most fully the idea of sacraments." Neander writes with great force on this apparent omission of the Ascension: "We make the same remark upon the ascension of Christ as was before made upon his miraculous conception. In regard to neither is prominence given to the special and actual <span class="accented">fact</span> in the apostolic writings; in regard to both, such a fact is presupposed in the general conviction of the apostles, and in the connection of Christian consciousness. Thus the end of Christ's appearance on earth corresponds with its beginning. Christianity rests upon supernatural facts - stands or falls with them. By faith in them has the Divine life been generated from the beginning. Were this faith gone, there might indeed remain many of the <span class="accented">effects</span> of what Christianity has been; but as for Christianity in the true sense, as for a Christian Church, there could be none." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he led them out as far</span> <span class="cmt_word">as to Bethany;</span> more accurately, <span class="accented">and he led them out until they were over against Bethany.</span> The scene of the Ascension could scarcely have been the central summit of the Mount of Olives (<span class="accented">Jebel-el-Tur</span>), according to ancient tradition; but it is more likely that it took place on one of the remoter uplands which lie above the village. "On the wild uplands which immediately overhang the village, he finally withdrew from the eyes of his disciples, in a seclusion which, perhaps, could nowhere else be found so near the stir of a mighty city; the long ridge of Olivet screening those hills, and those hills the village beneath them, from all sound or sight of the city behind; the view opening only on the wide waste of desert-rocks and ever-descending valleys, into the depths of the distant Jordan and its mysterious lake" (Dean Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 3.). <span class="cmt_word">He lifted up his hands, and blessed them</span>. In <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a> we read how Jesus, having assembled (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the apostles, gave them some last commands before he left them. It is not expressly stated that only the eleven were present on this occasion.' When he had finished speaking, "he lifted up his hands, and blessed them." There is <span class="accented">now</span> no laying on of hands. "Jam non imposuit manus," comments Bengel. Those hands, as they were lifted up, were already separated from them, the space between the Risen and those he was blessing grew greater every moment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] had led</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#958;&#942;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Ex&#275;gagen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1806.htm">Strong's 1806: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lead out, sometimes to death, execution.
