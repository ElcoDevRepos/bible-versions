In the context of <a href="/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>, Jesus is addressing those at a Pharisee's house, where He had been teaching about humility and the kingdom of God. His reply often serves as a parable, a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>A certain man</b><br>The "certain man" in parables often represents God or Jesus Himself. This character is central to the story and is used to illustrate divine actions or attributes. In this context, the man symbolizes God&#8217;s initiative in offering salvation and fellowship to humanity.<p><b>Prepared a great banquet</b><br>Banquets in biblical times were significant social events, often symbolizing abundance, celebration, and fellowship. The "great banquet" here represents the kingdom of God, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings. It signifies the richness and generosity of God's invitation to eternal life. This imagery is also reminiscent of the Messianic banquet prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where God prepares a feast for all peoples.<p><b>And invited many guests</b><br>The invitation to "many guests" reflects the inclusive nature of God's call to salvation. Historically, Jewish customs involved inviting guests well in advance, with a second invitation when the feast was ready. This dual invitation can be seen as a parallel to God's initial covenant with Israel and the subsequent call to all nations through Christ. The invitation underscores the theme of grace, as it is extended freely and widely, echoing the call to "go and make disciples of all nations" (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, Jesus uses this account to teach about the Kingdom of God and the nature of God's invitation to humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_certain_man.htm">A Certain Man</a></b><br>Represents God, who prepares a great banquet, symbolizing the Kingdom of Heaven and the salvation offered to all.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_banquet.htm">Great Banquet</a></b><br>Symbolizes the abundant blessings and eternal life offered in the Kingdom of God.

Throughout Scripture a solitary figure who gives lavish gifts often pictures God the Father (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>- The wording makes it plain: this &#8220;certain man&#8221; is not imaginary but represents a real Being who initiates salvation history. Just as God covenanted with Abram on His own initiative (<a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7&#8211;18</a>), so here the host moves first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prepared a great banquet</b><p>- &#8220;Great&#8221; signals abundance. The Old Testament anticipates God&#8217;s final, overflowing feast for His people (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>).<p>- Banquets in Scripture mark covenant celebrations&#8212;think of Sinai where the elders &#8220;saw God, and they ate and drank&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>).<p>- Jesus Himself embodies that feast: &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and the new wine of the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>). The parable pictures the total sufficiency of Christ&#8217;s redeeming work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And invited many guests</b><p>- The host&#8217;s invitation is generous, mirroring God&#8217;s desire that &#8220;all people be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3-4</a>).<p>- &#8220;Many&#8221; reminds us of the promise to Abraham: &#8220;all the families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Jesus later applies this to highways and hedges (<a href="/luke/14-23.htm">Luke 14:23</a>), highlighting Gentile inclusion (<a href="/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>).<p>- An invitation implies response. <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> blesses &#8220;those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb,&#8221; but <a href="/matthew/22-8.htm">Matthew 22:8</a> warns that some refuse and forfeit their seat. Acceptance is through faith alone (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Jesus replied</b><p>- The setting is a Sabbath meal where a guest exclaims, &#8220;Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15</a>). Jesus&#8217; reply shifts from polite table talk to eternal realities, pressing His hearers for personal commitment.<p>- His response corrects presumption. Many assumed birthright guaranteed a place at God&#8217;s table (<a href="/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33-39</a>). Jesus graciously exposes that misconception, echoing earlier warnings: &#8220;Not everyone who says to Me, &#8216;Lord, Lord,&#8217; will enter&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/14-16.htm">Luke 14:16</a> opens a parable revealing God as a gracious Host who has already made every provision for humanity&#8217;s salvation in Christ. The banquet displays His abundant, covenantal love, and the wide-open invitation underscores His desire to save many. Yet Jesus&#8217; reply also confronts complacency, urging each listener to receive the call personally and without delay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">A certain man made a great supper.</span>--Historically this has the interest of being the first occurrence of the "feast" imagery in our Lord's teaching. Here, as with so many of His parables, it is suggested by the occasion. Afterwards, as in <a href="/context/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1-13</a>, it is reproduced in an altered and expanded form. Here, as there, the giver of the feast is God.<p><span class= "bld">And bade many.</span>--The sequel determines the primary application of the word to the Jewish people. But it need hardly be said that it admits of manifold secondary, or even tertiary, applications through the whole history of the many churches of Christendom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he unto him</span>. The parable with which the great Teacher answered the guest's remark contains much and varied teaching for all ages of the Church, but in the first instance it replies to the speaker's words. "Yes," said the Master, "blessed indeed are they who sit down at the heavenly feast. You think you are one of those whom the King of heaven has invited to the banquet; what have you done, though, with the invitation? I know many who have received it who have simply tossed it aside; <span class="accented">are you of that number</span>? Listen now to my story of the Divine banquet and of the invited thereto." <span class="cmt_word">A certain man made a great supper, and bade many</span>. The kingdom of heaven, under the imagery of a great Banquet, was a picture well known to the Jews of that age. The guests in the Pharisee's house for the greater part were probably highly cultured men. At once they would grasp the meaning of the parable. They knew that the supper was heaven, and the Giver of the feast was God. The many - these were Israel, the long line of generations of the chosen people. So far strictly true, they thought; the Galilaean Teacher here is one with the rabbis of our Jerusalem schools. But, as Jesus proceeded, a puzzled, angry look would come upon the self-satisfied faces of Pharisee, scribe, and doctor; whispers would run round, "What means the Galilaean here?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
