Bethphage, meaning "house of unripe figs," was situated on the Mount of Olives and is less frequently mentioned in the Bible compared to Bethany. Bethany, meaning "house of affliction" or "house of dates," was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11). These villages were significant as they were close to Jerusalem, where Jesus would soon enter triumphantly. The proximity to Jerusalem highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' mission and the prophetic significance of His journey to the city.<p><b>at the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives is a ridge east of Jerusalem, significant in both Old and New Testament contexts. It was a place of prayer and teaching for Jesus (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>) and is associated with His ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>). The Mount of Olives is also linked to prophecy, as <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> predicts the Lord's feet will stand on this mount in the end times. This location underscores the messianic expectations and the fulfillment of prophecy through Jesus' actions.<p><b>He sent out two of His disciples</b><br>Sending two disciples was a common practice for Jesus, emphasizing the importance of companionship and witness (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>). This act also reflects the Jewish legal requirement for two witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The sending of the disciples here is a preparatory action for the triumphal entry, demonstrating Jesus' foreknowledge and authority. It also symbolizes the mission of the Church, as Jesus sends His followers to prepare the way for His coming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, preparing for His triumphal entry into Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethphage.htm">Bethphage</a></b><br>A small village near Jerusalem, its name means "house of unripe figs" in Hebrew, indicating its agricultural nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>Another village near Jerusalem, known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, and a place where Jesus often visited.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A significant location east of Jerusalem, often associated with important events in Jesus' ministry, including His ascension.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_disciples.htm">Two Disciples</a></b><br>Unnamed in this passage, they are sent by Jesus to carry out a specific task, demonstrating obedience and trust.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>The two disciples exemplify obedience by following Jesus' instructions without question.
