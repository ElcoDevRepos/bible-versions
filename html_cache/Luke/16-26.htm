In the context of <a href="/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>, Jesus is recounting the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. The rich man, now in Hades, is in torment and seeks relief. The phrase suggests that the following statement is an additional reason why his request cannot be granted. It emphasizes the finality and seriousness of the situation.<p><b>a great chasm has been fixed</b><br>The "great chasm" symbolizes an unbridgeable divide between the righteous and the unrighteous after death. This imagery reflects the Jewish understanding of Sheol, where the dead reside, and the separation between the faithful and the wicked. The term "fixed" implies permanence, indicating that the state of one's soul after death is irreversible. This concept is consistent with the biblical theme of final judgment and eternal separation from God for those who reject Him.<p><b>between us and you</b><br>The "us" refers to Abraham and Lazarus, representing the faithful who are in a place of comfort, often interpreted as "Abraham's bosom" or paradise. The "you" refers to the rich man, symbolizing those who are in torment due to their rejection of God's ways. This separation underscores the moral and spiritual divide between those who follow God and those who do not, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>so that even those who wish cannot cross from here to you</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the impossibility of altering one's eternal destiny after death. The desire to cross indicates a recognition of the better state of the righteous, yet it is too late for change. This aligns with the biblical teaching that the time for repentance and faith is during one's earthly life, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which speaks of judgment following death.<p><b>nor can anyone cross from there to us</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea of a fixed and eternal separation. It serves as a warning to the living about the consequences of their choices. The inability to cross from torment to comfort emphasizes the urgency of repentance and faith in Christ during one's lifetime. It also reflects the justice of God, who honors the decisions made by individuals regarding their relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A central figure in this parable, representing the faithful and the promise of God.

The scene brought before us is like one of the pictures of Dante's <span class= "ital">Commedia</span>--steep rocks and a deep gorge, and on one side the flames that burn and do not consume, and on the other, the fair garden of Paradise and the kingly palace, and the banquet at which Abraham presides. And those that are bearing the penalty, or reaping the reward, of their life are within sight and hearing of each other, and hold conversation and debate. It is obvious that no single detail of such a description can be pressed as a literal representation of the unseen world. What was wanted for the purpose of the parable was the dramatic and pictorial vividness which impresses itself on the minds and hearts of men, and this could not otherwise be gained.<p><span class= "bld">So that they which would pass from hence . . .</span>--So far as we may draw any inference from such a detail as this, it suggests the thought that the blessed look with pity and compassion on those who are in the penal fires, and would fain help them if they could. <span class= "ital">They that wish to pass</span> are spoken of in tones which present a striking contrast to the vindictive exultation that has sometimes shown itself in Christian writers, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as Tertullian (<span class= "ital">de Spectac.</span> c. 30), and Milton (<span class= "ital">Reformation in England, ad fin.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> A further lesson is, of course, implied, which strikes at the root of the specifically Romish theory of Purgatory and Indulgences--viz., that the wish is fruitless, that no interposition of the saints avails beyond the grave. The thought of their intercession that the discipline may do its appointed work is, indeed, not absolutely excluded, but that work must continue as long as God wills, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> till it attains its end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence</span>. Although the whole thought which runs through this parable is new, and peculiar to Christ, yet the colouring of the picture is nearly all borrowed from the great rabbinic schools; one of the few exceptions to this rule being this chasm or gulf which separates the two regions of Hades. The rabbis represented the division as consisting only of a wall. "What is the distance between Paradise and Gehenna? According to R. Johanan, a wall; according to other teachers, a palm-breadth, or only a finger-breadth" ('Midrash on Koheleth'). What, asks the awestruck reader, is this dreadful chasm? why is it impassable? will it be for ever there? will no ages of sorrow, no tears, no bitter heartfelt repentance succeed in throwing a bridge across it? Many have written here, and kindly souls have tried to answer the stern question with the gentle, loving reply which their souls so longed to hear. What is impossible to the limitless love of God? Nothing, wistfully says the heart. But, when interrogated closely, the parable and, indeed, all the Master's teaching on this point preserves a silence complete, impenetrable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">besides</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
