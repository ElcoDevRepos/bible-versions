In the cultural context of the time, blindfolding a person was a way to strip them of dignity and control. It symbolizes the spiritual blindness of those who could not see Jesus as the Messiah. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the suffering servant is described as being despised and rejected. The blindfolding also highlights the irony that those who were spiritually blind were attempting to blindfold the one who is the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>and kept demanding,</b><br>The continuous nature of their demands indicates persistent and aggressive mockery. This reflects the hostility and unbelief of the religious leaders and guards who were intent on discrediting Jesus. It also shows the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7-8</a>, where the psalmist speaks of being mocked and ridiculed. The repetition of their demands underscores the intensity of the situation and the depth of their scorn.<p><b>&#8220;Prophesy!</b><br>The demand for Jesus to prophesy was a taunt, challenging His identity as a prophet and the Messiah. In Jewish tradition, prophets were revered for their ability to speak God's truth and foretell future events. By demanding a prophecy, they were sarcastically questioning His divine authority and role. This mockery is a stark contrast to the true prophecies Jesus had already given, such as predicting Peter's denial (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>) and His own death and resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>).<p><b>Who hit You?&#8221;</b><br>This question was part of the cruel game they played, mocking Jesus' prophetic abilities. It reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord is struck and insulted. The act of striking someone while blindfolded was a common form of mockery and torture in ancient times, intended to degrade and dehumanize. This moment foreshadows the suffering and sacrifice Jesus would endure on the cross, where He would ultimately fulfill His role as the suffering servant who takes on the sins of the world (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being mocked and abused by His captors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guards/abusers.htm">The Guards/Abusers</a></b><br>These are the individuals who blindfolded Jesus and mocked Him, demanding that He prophesy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council that was responsible for the trial of Jesus, although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the authority behind His arrest and subsequent abuse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, specifically during the time of Jesus' arrest and trial.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passion_of_christ.htm">The Passion of Christ</a></b><br>The series of events leading up to and including the crucifixion of Jesus, of which this mocking is a part.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humility_of_christ.htm">The Humility of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to endure mockery and suffering demonstrates His humility and obedience to the Father's will.
