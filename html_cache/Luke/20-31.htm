This law required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow if the brother died without leaving a son, to ensure the continuation of the brother's family line. The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, used this scenario to challenge Jesus on the concept of life after death. The cultural context of levirate marriage was significant in Jewish society as it preserved family inheritance and lineage.<p><b>and in the same way all seven died</b><br>The repetition of the scenario with all seven brothers emphasizes the improbability and absurdity of the situation, which the Sadducees used to mock the idea of resurrection. This reflects their misunderstanding of the nature of the resurrection life, which Jesus later clarifies. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, which may suggest the totality of the Sadducees' argument against the resurrection.<p><b>leaving no children</b><br>The lack of children underscores the failure to fulfill the purpose of levirate marriage, which was to produce offspring to carry on the deceased brother's name. This detail highlights the futility of the Sadducees' argument, as they focus on earthly concerns rather than the spiritual realities of the resurrection. The absence of children also serves to set the stage for Jesus' teaching on the nature of eternal life, where earthly institutions like marriage do not apply.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who posed the question to Jesus to challenge Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, responding to the Sadducees' question with wisdom and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>A hypothetical group of brothers used in the Sadducees' question to illustrate their point about marriage and resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>The woman in the Sadducees' scenario who marries each brother in turn, according to the Levirate marriage law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus was teaching in the temple courts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>The Sadducees' question reveals their misunderstanding of the resurrection.

The mention of &#8220;the third&#8221; underscores the literal succession of brothers, showing that the scenario is not random but follows God-given levirate law (see <a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By accepting each marriage as legitimate, Jesus affirms the historical reality and authority of the Mosaic command.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a> reminds us the question is built on Scripture itself, not on human invention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in the same way all seven died</b><p>&#8226; The repetition (&#8220;in the same way&#8221;) highlights the completeness of the sequence&#8212;every brother obeys the law, and every brother dies.<p>&#8226; Their deaths emphasize human mortality (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>) and set up the Sadducees&#8217;

riddle: without a child, marital bonds seem unresolved, so whose wife will she be?<p>&#8226; The childlessness underscores the limitation of human effort and points ahead to God&#8217;s power to raise the dead (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/20-31.htm">Luke 20:31</a> stacks one orderly, literal detail upon another&#8212;third brother, all seven brothers, no children&#8212;to expose the Sadducees&#8217; skepticism. By affirming each step, Jesus shows the authority of Scripture and sets the stage for His teaching that resurrection life transcends earthly marriage. The passage reminds believers that while God&#8217;s commands govern life here, our ultimate hope rests in His promise of eternal life where death and earthly roles no longer bind us (<a href="/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35&#8211;36</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
