Priests were descendants of Aaron and held significant religious authority, responsible for temple sacrifices and rituals. The road referred to is likely the road from Jerusalem to Jericho, a well-traveled and dangerous route known for its steep descent and frequent robberies. The phrase "by chance" suggests a divine orchestration, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the encounter. This setting underscores the priest's role as a religious leader who would be expected to show compassion and adherence to the Law, which commands love for one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>but when he saw him</b><br>The priest's ability to see the injured man indicates awareness and opportunity to act. In biblical terms, seeing often implies understanding and responsibility (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The priest's sight of the man in need contrasts with his subsequent inaction, highlighting a failure to translate religious duty into compassionate action. This moment of seeing is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the moral and ethical implications of the parable.<p><b>he passed by on the other side</b><br>The priest's decision to pass by on the other side reflects a deliberate choice to avoid involvement. This action may have been influenced by concerns over ritual purity, as contact with a potentially dead body would render him ceremonially unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>). However, this avoidance reveals a prioritization of ritual over mercy, which Jesus critiques throughout His ministry (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). The priest's behavior serves as a critique of religious formalism that neglects the weightier matters of the law, such as justice and mercy. This phrase challenges the reader to consider the true nature of neighborly love and the call to act with compassion, regardless of personal cost or inconvenience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>A religious leader in Jewish society responsible for temple duties and rituals.

Scripture&#8217;s consistent theme&#8212;mercy over ritual, love over convenience&#8212;shows that genuine faith acts. The verse prepares us for the Good Samaritan, urging every believer to let knowledge translate into sacrificial, hands-on love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">By chance</span>.<span class= "bld"> . . .</span>--The passage is the only one in the New Testament in which the phrase occurs. Our Lord seems to use it as with a touch of what we have elsewhere termed irony. It seemed so casual, as such opportunities always do to men who neglect them, and yet it was, in the purpose of God, the test-moment of each man's character and life.<p><span class= "bld">There came down.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">there was going down.</span><p><span class= "bld">A certain priest.</span>--Jericho was at this time a priestly city, and so the journey of the priest from Jerusalem, as if returning from his week of sacerdotal offices there, has a touch of vivid naturalness. He, too, like the questioner, had been doing his duty to God, according to his measure of that duty.<p><span class= "bld">Passed by on the other side.</span>--The priest shrank, it might be, (1) from the trouble and peril of meddling with a man whom robbers had just attacked, and (2) from the fear of incurring a ceremonial defilement by coming into contact with what might possibly be a corpse before he reached it. He accordingly "passed by on the other side," not of the road only, but of the ravine through which the road passed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the</span> <span class="cmt_word">other side.</span> Both the priest and Levite were frequent travellers along this road between the capital and Jericho. Jericho was especially a city of priests, and when the allotted service or residence time at the temple was over, these would return naturally to their own homes. It has been remarked that the grave censure which this story levels at the everyday want of charity on the part of priests and Levites, fills up what would otherwise have been a blank in the Master's many-sided teaching. Nowhere else in the gospel narrative do we find our Lord taking up the attitude of censor of the priestly and Levitical orders. We have little difficulty in discovering reasons for this apparently strange reticence. They were still the official guardians and ministers of his Father's house. In his public teaching, as a rule, he would refrain from touching these or their hollow, pretentious lives. Once, and once only, in this one parable did he dwell - but even here with no severe denunciations, as in the case of scribes and Pharisees - on the shortcomings of the priestly caste. The bitter woe was fast coming on these degenerate children of Aaron. In less than half a century, that house, the glory and the joy of Israel, would be utterly destroyed, net to be raised again. No woe that the Christ could pronounce could be as crushing in its pitiless condemnation. <span class="accented">The very reason for the existence of priest and Levite as priest and Levite would exist no longer.</span> The selfish life of the doomed order, in which holiness seemed effectually to have been divorced from charity, is portrayed in the lifelike picture of the parable of the good Samaritan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">chance</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#947;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(synkyrian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4795.htm">Strong's 4795: </a> </span><span class="str2">A coincidence, accident, chance.
