In the context of <a href="/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>, Jesus is responding to the crowd after telling the Parable of the Ten Minas. This parable is part of Jesus' teaching on stewardship and accountability, emphasizing the importance of using what God has entrusted to individuals.<p><b>&#8216;I tell you that everyone who has will be given more;</b><br>This statement reflects a principle of divine economy and stewardship. It suggests that those who are faithful and diligent with what they have been given will receive even more. This principle is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the Parable of the Talents in <a href="/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a>. It underscores the idea that God rewards faithfulness and responsible management of His gifts.<p><b>but the one who does not have,</b><br>This phrase refers to those who fail to utilize or appreciate what they have been given. In the cultural context of the time, this could relate to the Jewish leaders who were not recognizing or using the spiritual truths and opportunities presented to them through Jesus' ministry.<p><b>even what he has will be taken away from him.</b><br>This is a warning of judgment and loss. It implies that neglecting or misusing what one has been given can lead to losing it altogether. This principle is seen in the broader biblical narrative, where Israel's failure to live up to their covenant with God led to exile and loss. It also serves as a caution to believers about the consequences of spiritual negligence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching about the Kingdom of God and the responsibilities of His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>In the parable preceding this verse, the servants are given minas (a form of currency) to manage while their master is away, representing believers entrusted with God's gifts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus, who entrusts His followers with resources and responsibilities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where Jesus is heading, symbolizing the culmination of His earthly ministry and the coming of the Kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_minas.htm">The Parable of the Minas</a></b><br>An event where Jesus uses a account to illustrate the principles of stewardship and accountability in God's Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>Believers are entrusted with resources, talents, and opportunities.
