In <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-8</a>, the days of Noah are characterized by widespread wickedness and corruption, with humanity's thoughts being continually evil. This context suggests a time of moral decay and spiritual apathy. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of ancient flood narratives, indicating a historical basis for the story of Noah. Theologically, Noah is seen as a type of Christ, a righteous man who provides a means of salvation through the ark, prefiguring Christ's role as the Savior.<p><b>so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man:</b><br>The "days of the Son of Man" refers to the period leading up to and including the return of Jesus Christ. This phrase emphasizes a future time of judgment and deliverance, similar to the flood in Noah's time. The term "Son of Man" is a messianic title used by Jesus, rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a divine figure given authority and an everlasting kingdom. The comparison suggests that just as the flood came unexpectedly to those who were unprepared, so will the return of Christ catch many off guard. This serves as a warning to remain vigilant and faithful, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>, where Jesus further elaborates on this comparison.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood due to his faithfulness and obedience.

The torch of religious feeling will have waned in that unknown and possibly distant future when Messiah shall reappear, and will be burning with a pale, faint light. The bulk of mankind will be given up to a sensuality which the higher culture then generally reached will have been utterly powerless to check or even to modify. Men, just as in the days when the ark was building and Noah was preaching, as in the days when the dark cloud was gathering over the doomed cities of the plain and Abraham was praying, will be entirely given up to their pursuits, their pleasures, and their sins. They will argue that the sun rose yesterday and on many yesterdays; of course it will rise to-morrow. Perfect security will have taken possession of the whole race, just as, on a smaller scale, was the case in the days of Noah and of Lot, when the floods came and the fire, and did their stern, pitiless work; so will that day of the second coming of Messiah, with its' bloody and fiery dawn, assuredly come on man when he is utterly unprepared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Just</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
