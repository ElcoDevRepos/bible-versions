The darkening of the sun is significant as it symbolizes the judgment and mourning over the death of Christ. In biblical context, darkness often represents God's judgment (<a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>) and is associated with significant divine interventions (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). This event fulfills the prophecy in Amos and serves as a cosmic sign of the gravity of the moment. Historically, some have attempted to explain this darkness as a solar eclipse, but the timing of Passover, which occurs during a full moon, makes a natural eclipse impossible, emphasizing the miraculous nature of this event.<p><b>and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle</b><br>The tearing of the temple veil is a profound event with deep theological significance. The veil separated the Holy of Holies, the most sacred part of the temple where God's presence dwelt, from the rest of the temple. Only the high priest could enter this area, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>). The tearing of the veil from top to bottom (as described in <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of the barrier between God and humanity, made possible through the atoning death of Jesus Christ. This act symbolizes the new covenant, granting believers direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>). It also marks the end of the old sacrificial system, as Jesus becomes the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>). Theologically, this event underscores the fulfillment of the law and the prophets, as Jesus embodies the true temple and high priest (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>Represents the natural world responding to the crucifixion of Jesus.

This was the inner veil, which hung between the holy place and the holy of holies. It was rich with costly embroidery, and very heavy. Before the willing surrender of life told of in the next versa (46), our Lord spoke twice more. These fifth and sixth words from the cross are preserved by St. John (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28, 30</a>). The first of these, "I <span class="accented">thirst</span> " - an expression of bodily exhaustion, of physical suffering - was predicted as part of the agony of the Servant of God (<a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). The second, "It <span class="accented">is finished</span>!" tells that "the earthly life had been carried to its issue. That every essential point in the prophetic portraiture of Messiah had been realized. The last suffering for sin had been endured. The end of all had been gained. Nothing was left undone or unborne" (Westcott). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
