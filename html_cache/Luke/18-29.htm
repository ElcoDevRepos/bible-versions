It is a common introductory phrase in the Gospels, indicating that what follows is a significant teaching or revelation. It underscores the authority of Jesus as a teacher and prophet, echoing the Old Testament prophets who often prefaced their messages with "Thus says the Lord."<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>This indicates that Jesus is responding to a question or situation. In the context of <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>, Jesus is addressing Peter's statement about the disciples having left everything to follow Him. This response is part of a larger discourse on the cost of discipleship and the rewards of following Christ.<p><b>no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children</b><br>This phrase highlights the sacrifices that may be required of those who choose to follow Jesus. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judaism, family ties were of utmost importance, and leaving one's family would have been a significant and challenging decision. This reflects the radical nature of discipleship, where allegiance to Jesus takes precedence over even the closest familial relationships. It also echoes the call of the prophets, like Elisha, who left his family to follow Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>).<p><b>for the sake of the kingdom of God</b><br>The "kingdom of God" is a central theme in Jesus' teaching, referring to God's sovereign rule and the realization of His will on earth as it is in heaven. This phrase indicates that the sacrifices made by disciples are not for personal gain but for the advancement of God's kingdom. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, which speaks of God's everlasting kingdom. The kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope, fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies the kingdom's values and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the cost and rewards of following Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are learning about the sacrifices required for the kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_god.htm">Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The spiritual realm over which God reigns, and the focus of Jesus' ministry and teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>Mentioned as those whom one might leave for the sake of the kingdom, representing personal sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice_for_the_kingdom.htm">Sacrifice for the Kingdom</a></b><br>Following Jesus may require significant personal sacrifices, including relationships and comforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>The sacrifices made for the kingdom of God are not in vain; they hold eternal significance and promise future rewards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_god's_kingdom.htm">Prioritizing God&#8217;s Kingdom</a></b><br>Believers are called to prioritize the kingdom of God above all earthly ties and possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_trust.htm">Faith and Trust</a></b><br>Trusting in God's provision and promises is essential when making sacrifices for His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_support.htm">Community and Support</a></b><br>The church community can provide support and fellowship to those who have made sacrifices for the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_18_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 18:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_29_s_call_to_sacrifice.htm">How does Luke 18:29 encourage sacrificial living for the kingdom of God?

To leave a "house" implied the breaking-up of the life of home and its relationships, but the companion of Paul and Barnabas might well have thought so little of parting with a "field," as a simple possession (comp. <a href="/context/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18-19</a>; <a href="/acts/4-34.htm" title="Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,">Acts 4:34</a>), that the word hardly dwelt upon his memory as connected with the idea of a special and extraordinary sacrifice.<p><span class= "bld">For the kingdom of God's sake.</span>--Note the freedom of reporting in the substitution of this phrase in the place of "for My name's sake," in St. Matthew, and "for My sake and the gospel's" in St. Mark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting</span>. Evidently, from the reports of the three evangelists, the reply of Jesus was a lengthy one, and contained much deep teaching. St. Luke only gives us, however, one section, so to speak, of the great discourse which followed upon Peter's question. Here and in St. Mark Peter and the twelve receive a quiet rebuke in this general promise. The Master seems to say, "My promises are not especially to you, my first followers, but to all who, not for any selfish hope of recompense or reward, but for the kingdom of God's sake, give up what they hold dearest; there will be real, true happiness for them even in this world, and in the world to come unspeakable joy will be their portion; theirs will be the life that knows no ending." St. Mark adds, with rare truth, that the happiness which his faithful are to enjoy in this world will be accompanied <span class="accented">with persecutions.</span> It is the same beautiful thought which the Master had put out before, only the gem now is set in different words. "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>; see, too, vers. 11, 12), St. Matthew deals especially with another division of the Lord's discourse. Here Jesus speaks of the future of the twelve; and, looking forward to the generally noble and self-devoted lives he saw these would live, he tells them of the great destiny surely reserved for them if they remained faithful to the end. But even here, in his words, "the first shall be last" (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>), and still more pointedly in the parable of the labourers which followed (<a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>), he warned these devoted but often mistaken men of the danger of self-complacency. It was only because he foresaw that in these really great ones this spirit would in the end be overcome (at least in eleven of them) that he made the grand and mysterious promise of <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>. The narrative here, in the three synoptical Gospels, is not continuous; at this point there is a break. There is little doubt but that the sickness and death of Lazarus of Bethany, and the summons of the sisters to Jesus, took place about this period. The three synoptical evangelists are silent here for reasons we have discussed elsewhere. Between vers. 30 and 31 there probably should be inserted the hasty journey to Bethany. The Master was not far when the news of his friend's death reached him. Immediately after the miracle there appears to have been a meeting of the Sanhedrin, when it was decided to put Jesus to death, though not during the ensuing Passover, with such precautions as were possible. The terrible decision became known. Jesus then retired to Ephraim, an obscure village about twenty miles from the city. Here a very short time was spent in absolute retirement and seclusion. But the Passover Feast was nigh at hand. In company with some of the crowded pilgrim caravans, and secure under their protection till his last few days of work were accomplished, Jesus journeys to Jerusalem. At this point the three synoptical Gospels take up the story again. The eleventh chapter of St. John fills up this gap in the connected story. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Truly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
