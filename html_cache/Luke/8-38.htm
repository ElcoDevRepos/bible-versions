The deliverance took place in the region of the Gerasenes, a Gentile area on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The man's possession and subsequent healing highlight Jesus' authority over spiritual forces. This event fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of setting captives free, and demonstrates Jesus' power to restore individuals to their right mind and community.<p><b>begged to go with Jesus.</b><br>The man's desire to accompany Jesus reflects a profound transformation and gratitude. In the cultural context, following a rabbi was a sign of discipleship and commitment. His request indicates a longing for continued relationship and learning from Jesus, akin to the calling of the twelve disciples. This also parallels the response of others who were healed by Jesus, such as the blind man in <a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>, who followed Jesus after receiving his sight.<p><b>But He sent him away, saying,</b><br>Jesus' response is significant. Instead of allowing the man to join Him, Jesus commissions him to stay in his own region. This decision underscores the importance of witnessing to one's own community. It also highlights the inclusivity of Jesus' mission, extending beyond Jewish territories to Gentile regions. The man's testimony would serve as a powerful witness to the transformative power of Jesus, preparing the way for future ministry in Gentile areas, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with the spread of the Gospel to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_possessed_by_demons.htm">The Man Possessed by Demons</a></b><br>Previously possessed by a legion of demons, this man lived among the tombs and was uncontrollable.

The restored man longed to remain with his Deliverer, but this was not permitted - the great Teacher bade him stay behind in his own country. Perhaps, thought the Redeemer, "some of these hardhearted Gadarenes will be won by his testimony - one of themselves, too, and so notorious a sufferer." His work, the Master told him, was <span class="accented">there</span> among his own people; so he stayed, and the next verse (39) tells us how he worked as a diligent evangelist.
