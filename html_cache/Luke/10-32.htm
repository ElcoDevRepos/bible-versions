They assisted the priests in the temple and were responsible for maintaining the sanctuary and teaching the law. This context highlights the expectation of religious leaders to act with compassion and mercy. The Levite's presence in the parable emphasizes the religious and social hierarchy of the time, where Levites were respected for their roles in worship and service. The phrase "came to that spot" suggests a deliberate approach, indicating that the Levite had the opportunity to assess the situation closely.<p><b>and saw him</b><br>The Levite's act of seeing the injured man is significant. In biblical terms, seeing often implies understanding and acknowledgment. This mirrors the call in Scripture to be aware of the needs around us, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>, which speaks against ignoring a brother or sister in need. The Levite's awareness of the man's condition contrasts with his subsequent actions, highlighting a disconnect between knowledge and compassion.<p><b>he passed by on the other side</b><br>This action of passing by on the other side indicates a deliberate avoidance. In the cultural context, touching a potentially dead body would render a Levite ceremonially unclean, which might explain his reluctance. However, the moral of the parable challenges such legalistic concerns, emphasizing mercy over ritual purity. This behavior is contrasted with the actions of the Good Samaritan later in the parable, who exemplifies true neighborly love. The Levite's choice reflects a broader theme in Scripture where religious duty is often critiqued when it lacks compassion, as seen in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, where God desires mercy, not sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, traditionally responsible for religious duties and temple service in Israel.

He is represented as at once better and worse than the priest--better in that he does not altogether turn aside, but "comes" and looks; worse in that his second thoughts are at variance with his first, and prevail against them. If he has more light, he also sins more against it.

They both, priest and Levite, shrank from the trouble and expense of meddling with the poor victim of the robbers; perhaps a cowardly fear of being identified with the robbers was mixed with these feelings. The whole of their conduct was inhuman, but not unnatural; alas! how faithfully is it copied by multitudes of men and women professing Christianity now! The Levite's conduct was better and worse than his official superior's - better, in that he did feel a little pity, and stopped to look, no doubt compassionately, on the sufferer; and worse, because he selfishly strangled the noble impulse in its birth, and passed on to his own place without so much as throwing a cloth over the poor maimed body to shelter it from the scorching sun, or the cold night dew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So too,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Homoi&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3668.htm">Strong's 3668: </a> </span><span class="str2">In like manner, similarly, in the same way, equally.
