In the Gospels, Jesus often uses such expressions to underscore the importance and veracity of His teachings. It reflects His role as a prophet and teacher, speaking with divine authority.<p><b>that there were many widows in Israel</b><br>Widows in ancient Israel were often among the most vulnerable members of society, lacking a husband's protection and provision. The mention of "many widows" highlights the widespread suffering and need during this period. This sets the stage for understanding the significance of God's intervention through Elijah.<p><b>in the time of Elijah</b><br>Elijah was a prominent prophet in Israel during the 9th century BC, known for his powerful miracles and confrontation with the idolatrous practices of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. His ministry is recorded in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17-19</a>. Elijah's time was marked by spiritual decline and apostasy in Israel, making his prophetic role crucial.<p><b>when the sky was shut for three and a half years</b><br>This refers to the drought that Elijah prophesied as a judgment from God due to Israel's idolatry and sin (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). The "three and a half years" is a specific period also mentioned in <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>, symbolizing a time of divine testing and judgment. The drought was a direct challenge to Baal, the Canaanite storm god, demonstrating the LORD's supremacy.<p><b>and great famine swept over all the land</b><br>The famine was a natural consequence of the prolonged drought, affecting not only Israel but surrounding regions. This severe famine underscores the seriousness of God's judgment and the dire circumstances faced by the people. It also sets the stage for God's miraculous provision through Elijah, as seen in the story of the widow of Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-16</a>).<br><br>This passage, as a whole, serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the importance of faithfulness to Him. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan, as Elijah was sent to a Gentile widow, prefiguring the broader mission of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful ministry and miracles, including the confrontation with the prophets of Baal and the raising of the widow's son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/widows_in_israel.htm">Widows in Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the many widows living in Israel during the time of Elijah, highlighting their suffering during the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe lack of food that lasted for three and a half years, affecting the entire land of Israel as a divine judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often experiencing cycles of faithfulness and rebellion, which led to various judgments and blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sky_was_shut.htm">Sky was shut</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the cessation of rain, leading to the famine, as a result of Elijah's prayer and God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>The famine was a direct result of God's judgment on Israel for their unfaithfulness.

Many widows lived in Israel, yet God&#8217;s miraculous provision went to a foreigner (v. 26). In the same way, Nazareth&#8217;s unbelief could shut them out of the blessings Christ brings.

And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian</span>. In support of these assertions, Jesus proceeds to quote two well known incidents in the story of Israel. They must remember God's mercies in past times were not confined to Israel. There were many starving widows among the chosen people, not a few childless, desolate hearths; but their own great Elijah was sent to none of these, but to a despised Phoenician woman in Sarepta, hard by Sidon. Elisha, that loved man of God, who passed by the homes of the people continually, performed his famous miracle of healing on no child of Israel, though many a leper mourned his sad lot among the chosen people; but the one on whom Elisha worked his mighty miracle of mercy was the Syrian leper Naaman, the great foe of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
