The context is the trial before the Sanhedrin, where Jesus is being mocked and ridiculed. The use of "they" refers to the religious leaders and guards who were present, highlighting the collective nature of the opposition against Jesus.<p><b>many other blasphemous things:</b><br>The term "blasphemous" is significant, as it denotes speech that is irreverent or disrespectful towards God. In Jewish law, blasphemy was a serious offense, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). Ironically, the accusers themselves are committing blasphemy by mocking the Son of God. This reflects the deep spiritual blindness and hardness of heart among those who should have recognized the Messiah. The phrase "many other" suggests that the verbal abuse was extensive and relentless.<p><b>against Him:</b><br>The focus of the blasphemy is Jesus, who is the central figure of the Gospel narrative. This opposition fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men." The hostility Jesus faced is a testament to His role as the suffering servant, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament and finds its fulfillment in the New Testament. The phrase underscores the personal nature of the attacks, as they are directed specifically at Jesus, who is both fully God and fully man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being mocked and blasphemed by the guards after His arrest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guards.htm">The Guards</a></b><br>These are the men who held Jesus in custody and were responsible for mocking and blaspheming Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the Jewish council responsible for Jesus' arrest and trial.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, specifically in the vicinity of the high priest's house.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_mocking.htm">The Event of Mocking</a></b><br>This is part of the larger account of Jesus' trial and suffering, where He is subjected to ridicule and blasphemy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_blasphemy.htm">Understanding Blasphemy</a></b><br>The term "blasphemous" in Greek is (blasph?me?), which means to speak evil or slander.

Their words follow the beating and blindfolding described in verses 63-64. Scripture shows this cruel chorus coming in waves (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67-68</a>; <a href="/mark/14-65.htm">Mark 14:65</a>). Their mouths, not satisfied with fists, pour out ridicule. The pattern is clear: sinful humanity, when confronted with the Holy One, speaks out of the overflow of a rebellious heart (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>; <a href="/romans/3-14.htm">Romans 3:14-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many other</b><p>The phrase signals sheer volume. Their mockery wasn&#8217;t a stray comment; it was sustained, habitual, and relentless. <a href="/psalms/69-20.htm">Psalm 69:20</a> pictures Messiah&#8217;s heartache: &#8220;I looked for comforters, but found none.&#8221; Here, instead of comfort He receives a barrage. <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> says He was &#8220;despised and rejected by men,&#8221; and Luke highlights just how thorough that rejection is&#8212;&#8220;many other&#8221; taunts beyond what is recorded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>blasphemous things</b><p>Blasphemy is slander against God&#8217;s name. By twisting Jesus&#8217; true identity, they violate the third commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>) and fulfill the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7-8</a>, &#8220;All who see Me mock Me; they shake their heads.&#8221; Their taunts echo later scoffers at the cross (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35-39</a>). Yet Jesus remains silent (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>), proving His innocence and His willingness to bear the insults we deserve (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Him</b><p>The hostility is personal. These words are hurled not merely in His presence but squarely &#8220;against Him,&#8221; the Son of Man and Son of God (<a href="/luke/22-69.htm">Luke 22:69-70</a>). <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-27</a> links this moment to <a href="/bsb/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where rulers gather &#8220;against the Lord and against His Anointed.&#8221; Their opposition underlines our need for a Savior, for in our sin nature we, too, stand opposed to God (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>). Yet Jesus&#8217; love pursues His enemies (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>), turning blasphemers like Saul of Tarsus into believers (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-65.htm">Luke 22:65</a> shows the guards volleying an onslaught of verbal abuse at Jesus. Their mounting insults reveal hardened hearts, fulfill messianic prophecy, and contrast sharply with Christ&#8217;s patient, redemptive silence. The verse calls believers to acknowledge the depth of human sin, to marvel at the Savior who endured it, and to respond with reverence, gratitude, and faithful witness to the One who bore blasphemy &#8220;against Him&#8221; so He could speak forgiveness over us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-65.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
