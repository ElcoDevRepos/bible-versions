Jesus' action of calling the children to Himself demonstrates His counter-cultural approach, valuing those whom society might overlook. This act reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing that the kingdom of God is open to all, regardless of social standing. It also highlights Jesus' compassion and His role as a shepherd who gathers His flock, reminiscent of prophecies about the Messiah who would care for His people (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Let the little children come to Me,</b><br>Jesus' invitation to the children signifies the openness and accessibility of His message. In a broader theological sense, this phrase underscores the necessity of approaching God with childlike faith and humility. The act of coming to Jesus is symbolic of seeking salvation and entering into a relationship with Him. This invitation is echoed in other parts of the Gospels where Jesus calls individuals to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>and do not hinder them!</b><br>This command not to hinder the children can be seen as a rebuke to the disciples who were trying to prevent them from approaching Jesus. It serves as a reminder that no barriers should be placed between individuals and Christ. Theologically, it underscores the importance of removing obstacles that prevent people from experiencing the grace and love of God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God desiring all to come to repentance and knowledge of the truth (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>).<p><b>For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</b><br>This statement highlights the qualities of children&#8212;such as trust, dependence, and humility&#8212;that are essential for entering the kingdom of God. It suggests that the kingdom is not about power or status but about a heart posture that is open and receptive to God's rule. This teaching is consistent with Jesus' earlier statements about the need to become like children to enter the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). It also reflects the prophetic vision of a kingdom where the meek and humble are exalted (<a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the nature of the kingdom of God and the qualities required to enter it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Representing innocence, humility, and dependence, the children are used by Jesus as an example of the kind of faith and openness required to enter the kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the disciples were present and initially rebuked those bringing children to Jesus, prompting His response.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The broader group of people present, including parents and others who were bringing children to Jesus for blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/childlike_faith.htm">Childlike Faith</a></b><br>Embrace a faith characterized by trust, humility, and openness, akin to that of a child.

(See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God</span>. St. Mark, who gives us here the memories of a faithful eye-witness - St. Peter - records how much displeased Jesus was when he saw them pushing back the mothers and their little ones, eager to win a smile or perhaps a touch from him whom the people justly regarded as the children's Friend. It seems also to have been the practice for Jewish mothers to bring their babes to famous rabbis, and to ask these teachers to bless their little ones. Christ's "interest in the little children was real, <span class="accented">and for their own sakes.</span> It was primary; not merely secondary, and because of the childlikeness of his subjects. <span class="accented">If they who are like little children belong to the kingdom of heaven, why should we for a moment doubt that the little children themselves belong to the kingdom</span>? Doubtless they all do. And if that change which men call <span class="accented">death</span> happen to them while they are still little children, we may rest assured that it will be to the little ones <span class="accented">bye everlasting.</span> They will not be shut out from the higher province of the kingdom of heaven when they are snatched away from the lower" (Dr. Morrison). St. Mark's account, being that of an eye-witness, is fuller and more graphic. It is read in the Office of the Church of England for the Baptism of Infarcts, wherein young children are in like manner presented to Christ. It is considered that the Master's words and act here justify the Church in commending infants, as such, to the blessing of their Father. Surely if little ones were capable of spiritual blessings then, they are so now. It is noticeable that these children were not brought to the Lord to be taught, but "that he should put his hands upon them, and bless them" (<a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called [the children] to [Him]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(prosekalesato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
