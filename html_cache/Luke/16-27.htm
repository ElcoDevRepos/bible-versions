The term "father" is a respectful address, acknowledging Abraham's role as the patriarch of the Jewish faith. This highlights the rich man's understanding of his heritage and the respect due to Abraham. The plea indicates a shift from self-concern to concern for others, albeit too late. It underscores the importance of repentance and intercession while still alive, as echoed in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which states that after death comes judgment.<p><b>he said,</b><br>The rich man is speaking from Hades, a place of torment, which contrasts with Lazarus's comfort in Abraham's bosom. This setting illustrates the reversal of fortunes in the afterlife, a common theme in Jesus' teachings. The narrative emphasizes the finality of one's earthly choices and their eternal consequences, aligning with the parable's broader message about wealth, compassion, and the afterlife.<p><b>send Lazarus</b><br>The request to send Lazarus indicates the rich man's continued misunderstanding of his situation and the nature of repentance. He still views Lazarus as a servant, reflecting his unchanged heart and failure to grasp the equality of all souls before God. This mirrors the societal norms of the time, where class distinctions were pronounced. Theologically, it highlights the need for humility and the recognition of others' worth, as taught in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>.<p><b>to my father&#8217;s house,</b><br>The mention of "my father's house" suggests a familial concern, indicating the rich man's desire to warn his brothers. This reflects the Jewish cultural emphasis on family and the responsibility to guide one's household in righteousness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. It also underscores the urgency of repentance and the importance of heeding God's word, as the rich man realizes too late the necessity of living a life aligned with divine principles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>A central figure in the parable who lived a life of luxury and is now in Hades, experiencing torment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A poor man who suffered in life but is now comforted in Abraham's bosom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who represents the faithful and is a figure of authority in the afterlife.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hades.htm">Hades</a></b><br>The place of the dead where the rich man finds himself in torment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man's_brothers.htm">The Rich Man's Brothers</a></b><br>The rich man&#8217;s family who are still alive and unaware of the fate that awaits them if they do not repent.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_repentance.htm">Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>The rich man's plea for his brothers highlights the urgency of repentance and the need to turn to God while there is still time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_warn_others.htm">Responsibility to Warn Others</a></b><br>Just as the rich man wanted to warn his brothers, we have a responsibility to share the truth of the Gospel with those around us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_needy.htm">Compassion for the Needy</a></b><br>The parable challenges us to examine how we treat those in need and to act with compassion and generosity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_consequences.htm">Eternal Consequences</a></b><br>Our actions in this life have eternal consequences, and we must live with an awareness of the life to come.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god's_word.htm">Listening to God's Word</a></b><br>The rich man's brothers have Moses and the Prophets, emphasizing the sufficiency and authority of Scripture in guiding us to truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_27_Warn_others_to_repent.htm">How does Luke 16:27 emphasize the importance of warning others about repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Family_s_role_in_spiritual_duty_Luke_16_27.htm">What role does family play in spiritual accountability according to Luke 16:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Luke_16_27_urgency_in_evangelism.htm">How can we apply the urgency of Luke 16:27 in evangelism today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_16_27_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Luke 16:27 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_warn_loved_ones_of_eternal_fate.htm">What practical steps can we take to warn loved ones about eternal consequences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_the_rich_man_plead_for_kin.htm">Why does the rich man plead for his brothers in Luke 16:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_27_s_take_on_afterlife_talk.htm">How does Luke 16:27 challenge the concept of afterlife communication?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_16_27_stress_repentance.htm">What does Luke 16:27 reveal about the importance of repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_the_dead_aware_of_events_on_earth.htm">Are the dead aware of events on earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_torments_of_sheol.htm">What are the torments of Sheol?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_abraham's_bosom.htm">What is the concept of Abraham's Bosom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_inherit_david's_throne.htm">Would Jesus inherit David's throne?

There is no rebellious defiance, no blasphemous execration, such as men have pictured to themselves as resounding ever more in the realms of darkness. Abraham is the sufferer's father still, and he yet counts on his sympathy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them; lest they also come into this place of torment</span>. The condemned acquiesces in this dread fact; convinced of the utter impossibility of any interchange of sympathy between him and the dwellers in the realms of bliss, he ceases to pray for any alleviation of his own sad and wretched state. But another wail of woe quickly rises from the awful solitude. What means this second prayer of the doomed man? Are we to read in it the first signs of a new and noble purpose in the lost soul, the first dawning of loving thoughts and tender care for others? It seems, perhaps, unkind not to recognize this; but the Divine Speaker evidently had another purpose here when he put these words into the mouth of the lost rich man - he would teach the great lesson to the living that a selfish life is inexcusable. On first thoughts, the rich man's request to Abraham appears prompted alone by his anxiety for the future of his brothers who were still alive; but on examination it would seem, to use the striking words of Professor Bruce, that he wished rather to justify his own sad past by some such. reflection as this: "Had only some one come from the dead with the calm, clear light of eternity shining in his eyes, to inform me that this life beyond is no table, that Paradise is a place or state of unspeakable bliss, and Gehenna a place or state of unspeakable woe, I should have renounced my voluptuous, selfish ways, and entered on the path of piety and charity. If one had come to me from the dead, I had surely repented, and so should not have come to this place of torment." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8216;Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
