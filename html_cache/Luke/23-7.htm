Herod's jurisdiction over Galilee is significant, as it reflects the Roman practice of regional governance. Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, is known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-29</a>). This jurisdictional transfer highlights the political maneuvering of Pilate, who sought to avoid responsibility for Jesus' fate.<p><b>he sent Him to Herod</b><br>Pilate's decision to send Jesus to Herod can be seen as an attempt to pass the responsibility of judgment. This act also reflects the strained relationship between Pilate and Herod, which is later reconciled through this interaction (<a href="/luke/23-12.htm">Luke 23:12</a>). The sending of Jesus to Herod fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers gather against the Lord's Anointed. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of Jesus' prediction that He would be handed over to the Gentiles (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>).<p><b>who himself was in Jerusalem at that time</b><br>Herod's presence in Jerusalem during the Passover festival is significant, as it was customary for Jewish leaders to be in the city for major feasts. This detail underscores the providential timing of events leading to the crucifixion. Herod's presence in Jerusalem also provides a rare opportunity for him to encounter Jesus, whom he had long desired to see (<a href="/luke/9-9.htm">Luke 9:9</a>).

The verse reveals political maneuvering, human reluctance to render true justice, and God&#8217;s sovereign design that multiple authorities would examine&#8212;and ultimately reject&#8212;His spotless Son.
