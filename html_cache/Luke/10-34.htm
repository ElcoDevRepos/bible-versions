In the cultural context of Jesus' time, Jews and Samaritans had deep-seated animosity, yet the Samaritan crosses these boundaries to help a wounded man. This act reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and exemplified by Jesus in His ministry.<p><b>and bandaged his wounds</b><br>The act of bandaging wounds indicates immediate and practical care. In ancient times, travelers often faced dangers such as robbers, making this a relatable scenario for Jesus' audience. The Samaritan's actions prefigure Christ's healing ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>, where Jesus heals every disease and affliction.<p><b>pouring on oil and wine</b><br>Oil and wine were common first-century remedies for wounds. Oil would soothe and wine, with its antiseptic properties, would cleanse. This reflects the use of natural resources for healing, akin to the anointing with oil in <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>. Symbolically, oil often represents the Holy Spirit, and wine can symbolize the blood of Christ, pointing to spiritual healing.<p><b>Then he put him on his own animal</b><br>By placing the wounded man on his own animal, the Samaritan sacrifices his comfort for the sake of another. This selflessness is a type of Christ, who bore our burdens (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>). The act of carrying another's burden is echoed in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, where believers are called to fulfill the law of Christ through love.<p><b>brought him to an inn</b><br>Inns during this period were basic and often unsafe, yet the Samaritan ensures the man's continued care by taking him to a place of refuge. This action parallels the church's role as a sanctuary for the weary and wounded, offering rest and healing through community and the Word of God.<p><b>and took care of him</b><br>The Samaritan's ongoing care demonstrates commitment and compassion, going beyond a one-time act of kindness. This mirrors the continuous care and intercession of Christ for believers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, where Jesus is described as always living to intercede for us. The Samaritan's actions serve as a model for Christian discipleship, emphasizing mercy and love in action.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan.htm">The Samaritan</a></b><br>A traveler who demonstrates compassion and mercy, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_injured_man.htm">The Injured Man</a></b><br>A victim of robbery and violence, left for dead on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_from_jerusalem_to_jericho.htm">The Road from Jerusalem to Jericho</a></b><br>A dangerous and treacherous path known for its frequent robberies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inn.htm">The Inn</a></b><br>A place of refuge and care where the Samaritan takes the injured man for further assistance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oil_and_wine.htm">Oil and Wine</a></b><br>Common first-century medicinal agents used for cleansing and soothing wounds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>True compassion requires us to act, not just feel sympathy.
