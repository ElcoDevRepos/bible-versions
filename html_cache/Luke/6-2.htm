They were known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and the oral traditions that had developed around it. Their questioning reflects their role as religious authorities who were concerned with maintaining the purity of Jewish law and practice. This encounter highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, a recurring theme in the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?&#8221;</b><br>The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a day of rest and worship as commanded in the Fourth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). The Pharisees had developed extensive interpretations of what constituted "work" on the Sabbath, which included activities like harvesting. In this context, Jesus' disciples were picking grain, which the Pharisees considered a violation of the Sabbath law. This question underscores the conflict between Jesus' interpretation of the law and the Pharisaic tradition. Jesus often emphasized the spirit of the law over the letter, pointing to the deeper purpose of the Sabbath as a time for mercy and restoration, as seen in His response in the following verses. This incident also foreshadows the greater revelation of Jesus as the Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/luke/6-5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>), indicating His authority over traditional interpretations and His fulfillment of the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses and additional oral traditions.

Round the original "sabbath law" of Moses thirty-nine prohibitions had been laid down in the oral law; round these "thirty-nine" a vast number of smaller rules had grouped themselves. Amongst these greater and lesser sabbath restrictions were prohibitions against "reaping and threshing." Now, <span class="accented">plucking ears of corn</span> was defined to be a kind of "reaping," and <span class="accented">rubbing the ears in the hands</span> a kind of "threshing." "See," cried some of these spying Pharisees, "do thy disciples publicly break the sabbath, and dost thou not rebuke them?" The Lord's reply does not attempt to discuss what was and what was not lawful on the sabbath, but in broad terms he expounds the great doctrine respecting the significance, limits, and purpose of every law relating to outward acts, even in the event of that law having been given by God, which was not the case in the present alleged transgression. How rigidly the stricter Jews some fourteen or fifteen centuries later still kept these strained and exaggerated traditional sabbath-day restrictions, is shown in a curious anecdote of the famous Abarbanel, "when, in 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain, and were forbidden to enter the city of Fez, lest they should cause a famine, they lived on grass; yet even in this state '<span class="accented">religiously avoided the violation of their sabbath by plucking the grass with their hands.</span> To avoid this they took the much more laborious method of grovelling on their knees, and cropping it with their teeth!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#8050;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
