Jesus was in the midst of addressing the crowd or perhaps speaking to the woman who had been healed from her bleeding (<a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43-48</a>). The interruption underscores the pressing nature of Jairus's need and the desperation of the situation. It highlights the constant demands on Jesus' time and attention during His ministry.<p><b>someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader</b><br>The synagogue leader, Jairus, was a person of significant social and religious standing within the Jewish community. Synagogues were central to Jewish religious life, serving as places of worship, teaching, and community gathering. The arrival of someone from Jairus's house suggests a close connection and the importance of the message being delivered. This reflects the communal nature of Jewish society, where news, especially of a critical nature, was quickly shared among family and community members.<p><b>&#8220;Your daughter is dead,&#8221;</b><br>This blunt announcement marks a pivotal moment in the narrative. The death of Jairus's daughter represents a situation beyond human hope and intervention, setting the stage for a demonstration of Jesus' divine power over life and death. In Jewish culture, death was a profound event, often accompanied by mourning rituals and a sense of finality. This statement would have been devastating to Jairus, highlighting the depth of his impending grief.<p><b>he told Jairus.</b><br>The direct address to Jairus personalizes the message, emphasizing the personal loss and emotional impact on him as a father. Jairus's role as a synagogue leader would have made him a man of faith and influence, yet here he is portrayed in a moment of vulnerability and helplessness, needing divine intervention.<p><b>&#8220;Do not bother the Teacher anymore.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects a common human perspective that death is the ultimate end, beyond the reach of any teacher or healer. The term "Teacher" acknowledges Jesus' role as a rabbi and respected figure, yet the statement implies a limitation to His power. This sets the stage for Jesus to reveal His authority over death, challenging the prevailing beliefs and expectations of those around Him. The phrase also reflects a cultural understanding of not troubling a respected figure with what seems to be an insurmountable problem, highlighting the contrast between human limitations and divine capability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus.htm">Jairus</a></b><br>A synagogue leader, a man of authority and faith, seeking Jesus' help for his dying daughter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus'_daughter.htm">Jairus' Daughter</a></b><br>The young girl who is the subject of the miracle, representing innocence and the need for divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messenger.htm">The Messenger</a></b><br>The person who brings the news of the daughter's death, representing doubt and despair.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>A place of Jewish worship and community, highlighting Jairus' role and status.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_desperation.htm">Faith in Desperation</a></b><br>Jairus' approach to Jesus shows that faith often begins in moments of desperation.

This interruption, which must have occupied some time, was, no doubt, a sore trial to the ruler's faith. His little daughter was, he knew well, dying; and though he trusted that the famous Rabbi had power to arrest the progress of disease, he never seems for a moment to have contemplated his wrestling with <span class="accented">death</span>; indeed, the bare thought of recalling the spirit to the deserted clay tenement evidently never occurred to any of that sad household, while the <span class="accented">hired</span> mourners (vers. 52, 53, and <a href="/mark/5-38.htm">Mark 5:38</a>), too accustomed to the sight of death in all its forms to dream of any man, however great a physician, recalling the dead to life, transgressing all courtesy, positively laughed him to scorn. It seems to us strange now that this supreme miracle should have seemed so much harder a thing to accomplish than the healing of blindness or deafness, or the creation of wine and bread and fish, or the instantaneous quieting of the elements, the waves, and the wind. While sufferers and their friends and the Lord's disciples, in countless instances, asked him to put forth his power in cases of disease and sickness, neither friend nor disciple ever asked him to raise the dead to life. To the last, in spite of what they had seen, none, till after the Resurrection, could persuade themselves that he was, indeed, the Lord of death as well as of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[While] He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
