In the cultural context of Jesus' time, the idea of loving one's enemies was revolutionary. The Old Testament law emphasized justice and retribution (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>), but Jesus introduces a higher standard of love. This echoes the teachings in <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>, where kindness to an enemy is encouraged. Jesus exemplifies this love on the cross, praying for those who crucified Him (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><b>do good to them</b><br>The call to actively do good to enemies goes beyond mere tolerance or passive non-retaliation. It involves taking positive steps to benefit those who oppose us. This reflects the nature of God, who provides for both the righteous and the unrighteous (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). The early church practiced this principle, as seen in <a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>, where Stephen prays for those stoning him.<p><b>and lend to them, expecting nothing in return</b><br>In the ancient world, lending was often transactional, with the expectation of repayment with interest. Jesus' instruction to lend without expecting repayment challenges the economic norms of the time and reflects a radical generosity. This principle is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israelites were encouraged to lend freely to the poor (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). It underscores the believer's trust in God's provision rather than human reciprocity.<p><b>Then your reward will be great</b><br>The promise of a great reward is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, emphasizing the eternal perspective believers should maintain. This reward is not necessarily material but spiritual and eternal, aligning with the treasures in heaven mentioned in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>. The concept of divine reward is also seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, where faith is linked to believing that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>and you will be sons of the Most High</b><br>Being called "sons of the Most High" signifies a relationship with God characterized by reflecting His nature. In biblical times, being a "son" often implied sharing in the character and mission of the father. This phrase indicates that by loving enemies and doing good, believers demonstrate their identity as God's children, similar to how Jesus, the Son of God, revealed the Father's love (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<p><b>for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked</b><br>This statement highlights God's grace and mercy, extending kindness even to those who do not acknowledge Him. It reflects the divine attribute of common grace, where God provides for all humanity regardless of their response to Him (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>). This kindness is a model for believers, who are called to imitate God's character in their interactions with others, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this teaching, providing guidance on how to live a life that reflects the character of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose or act against us, whom Jesus instructs us to love and treat with kindness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_most_high.htm">Sons of the Most High</a></b><br>A term used to describe those who emulate God's character, particularly His kindness and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High (God)</a></b><br>The ultimate example of kindness and mercy, even to those who are ungrateful and wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to follow His example.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/love_beyond_boundaries.htm">Love Beyond Boundaries</a></b><br>Jesus calls us to love not just those who love us but also our enemies.

Such obedience brings divine reward and visibly marks us as children of the Most High, whose kindness reaches even the ungrateful and wicked. Living this verse showcases the gospel, displaying to a watching world the Father&#8217;s generous, redeeming heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Love ye your enemies.</span>--The tense of the Greek verb may be noted as implying a perpetual abiding rule of action.<p><span class= "bld">Hoping for nothing again.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in nothing losing hope.</span> It is possible that the Greek verb may have the sense given in the text, but its uniform signification in the LXX. (as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/22-21.htm" title="Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning to favour.">Ecclesiasticus 22:21-24</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/27-21.htm" title="As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.">Ecclesiasticus 27:21</a>), which must be allowed great weight in interpreting a writer like St. Luke, is that of "giving up hope," <span class= "ital">despairing.</span> And this gives, it is obvious, a meaning not less admirable than that of the received version, "Give and lend according to the law of Christ, and do not let the absence of immediate profit make you lose heart and hope." There is a "great reward." The last words at least remind us of the promise made to Abraham, and may be interpreted by it. God Himself is our "exceeding great reward" (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a>). One or two MSS. give a masculine instead of a neuter pronoun after the verb, and in that case the verb must be taken as transitive. We have accordingly to choose between <span class= "ital">in nothing despairing,</span> or <span class= "ital">driving no man to despair.</span> On the whole, the former seems preferable. So taken, we may compare it with St. Paul's description of "charity" or "love," as "hoping all things" (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.">1Corinthians 13:7</a>), and his counsel, "Be not weary in well doing" (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">your reward shall be great,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ye shall be the children of the Highest</span>. It has been objected by the enemies of Christianity that, after all, Jesus offered his followers a reward by way of payment to them for their self-sacrificing lives on earth. What, however, is this reward? Is it not a share in that Divine and glorious life of God, who is all love; a hope of participation in that eternal work of his which will go from blessing to blessing, from glory to glory; a certain expectation of dying only to wake up in his likeness, satisfied? The Eternal had already made a similar promise to his faithful servant Abraham. when he bade him fear not, because here on earth God was his Shield, and after death would be his exceeding great Reward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#955;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Pl&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4133.htm">Strong's 4133: </a> </span><span class="str2">However, nevertheless, but, except that, yet.
