This turning signifies a deliberate focus on the woman, who is often identified as a sinner. Jesus' interaction with Simon, a religious leader, contrasts with His acceptance of the woman, demonstrating His mission to reach the marginalized and sinful. This act of turning also emphasizes the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, where He addresses individuals directly and personally.<p><b>&#8220;Do you see this woman?</b><br>Jesus challenges Simon to truly see the woman, not just as a sinner but as a person of worth and dignity. This question invites Simon to look beyond societal labels and prejudices. In the cultural context, women, especially those with a sinful reputation, were often disregarded. Jesus' question is a call to recognize her humanity and her act of devotion. It also serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that God looks at the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet,</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, offering water for a guest's feet was a common courtesy, reflecting hospitality and respect. Roads were dusty, and washing feet was a practical necessity. Simon's neglect of this custom indicates a lack of honor and respect for Jesus. This omission contrasts with the woman's actions and highlights Simon's failure to recognize Jesus' significance.<p><b>but she wet My feet with her tears</b><br>The woman's tears symbolize deep repentance and devotion. Her emotional response indicates a profound awareness of her sin and a desire for forgiveness. In biblical terms, tears often represent a broken and contrite heart (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). Her tears serve as a form of cleansing, replacing the water Simon failed to provide, and demonstrate her humility and love for Jesus.<p><b>and wiped them with her hair.</b><br>In Jewish culture, a woman's hair was considered her glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>). By using her hair to wipe Jesus' feet, the woman performs an act of humility and self-abasement. This action signifies her willingness to lay down her pride and honor at Jesus' feet. It also reflects a deep personal sacrifice and devotion, as she uses what is most precious to her in service to Christ. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus' body for burial, symbolizing preparation and reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who addresses Simon and highlights the actions of the woman.
