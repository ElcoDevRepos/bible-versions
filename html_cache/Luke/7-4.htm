The act of coming to Jesus signifies recognition of His authority and power. The elders' earnest plea reflects the seriousness and urgency of their request. In the cultural context, a centurion was a Roman officer, typically commanding about 100 soldiers, and was often seen as an oppressor by the Jewish people. However, the fact that Jewish elders are advocating for him suggests he was respected and had a good relationship with the local Jewish community. This interaction underscores the centurion's humility and the respect he commanded, despite being a Gentile. The earnestness of their plea also indicates their belief in Jesus' ability to heal, showcasing the growing recognition of His miraculous powers.<p><b>&#8220;This man is worthy to have You grant this,&#8221;</b><br>The elders' declaration of the centurion's worthiness is significant. In Jewish culture, worthiness was often associated with adherence to the Law and good deeds. The centurion's worthiness, as perceived by the elders, likely stems from his support and love for the Jewish nation, as further detailed in the following verses where it is mentioned that he built a synagogue for them. This is a remarkable statement, considering the typical animosity between Jews and Roman authorities. Theologically, this phrase can be contrasted with the Christian understanding of grace, where worthiness is not based on deeds but on faith. The centurion's faith, which is later commended by Jesus, becomes a pivotal lesson in the narrative, illustrating that true worthiness in the eyes of God is rooted in faith and humility rather than social status or ethnic background. This also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the Kingdom of God, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_elders.htm">The Jewish Elders</a></b><br>Representatives of the Jewish community who approach Jesus on behalf of the centurion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion.htm">The Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer who shows great faith and humility, seeking Jesus' help for his servant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles and taught in the synagogue.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>The centurion's valued servant who is ill and in need of healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_boundaries.htm">Faith Beyond Boundaries</a></b><br>The centurion, a Gentile, demonstrates faith that surpasses many in Israel.

There are several mentions of these Roman military officers in the Gospels and Acts, and in every instance the mention is a favourable one. Still more notable instances occur in the case of Cornelius - to whom Peter was specially sent (<a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10, 11</a>.) - of the centurion who was on guard at the execution on Calvary, and of the centurion who conveyed Paul to Rome (<a href="/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1-3</a>). On these Gentile soldiers "the faith and life of Judaism (seen, we may well believe, to more advantage in the village life of Galilee than amid the factions of Jerusalem) had made a deep impression: he found a purity, reverence, simplicity, and nobleness of life which he had not found elsewhere, and so he loved the nation, and built a new one of the synagogues of the town" (Dean Plumptre). The centurion was apparently one of those foreigners who - without submitting to circumcision and other burdensome ceremonial rites which were incompatible with the exercise of his profession - had accepted the faith of Israel, and worshipped with the people in the position of one who, in another age, would have been termed a "proselyte of the gate." He was evidently one of those true-hearted men who translated a beautiful <span class="accented">creed</span> into <span class="accented">acts</span>, for it was specially urged by the elders, in their petition to Jesus, that he loved the people, no doubt emphasizing his generous almsgivings, and, as a crowning act of his kindness, had built a synagogue Capernaum. Modern travellers tell us that among the ruins of this city of Jesus are the remains of a white marble synagogue of the time of the Herods. This may have been the Roman soldier's noble gift to Israel. The whole character of this nameless officer seems to have been singularly noble. In those selfish days of undreamed-of luxury, cruelty, and heartlessness, for <span class="accented">a master</span> to care for, much less to love, <span class="accented">a slave</span> was, comparatively speaking, rare. From his message to Jesus (ver. 7) it would seem as though he had a clearer conception who the poor Galilaean Teacher was than any one else at that period of the public ministry, not excluding the inner circle of disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(paragenomenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3854.htm">Strong's 3854: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and ginomai; to become near, i.e. Approach; by implication, to appear publicly.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
