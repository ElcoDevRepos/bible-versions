In the cultural context of the time, hospitality was a significant virtue, and not welcoming a traveler was a serious breach of social norms. The disciples were to expect both acceptance and rejection as they preached the Kingdom of God. This instruction underscores the reality of opposition to the Gospel message, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<p><b>shake the dust off your feet</b><br>This action was a symbolic gesture practiced by devout Jews when they returned from Gentile lands, signifying the removal of pagan defilement. By instructing the disciples to do this, Jesus was indicating that those who rejected the message were to be regarded as outsiders to the covenant community. This act served as a powerful visual statement of judgment and separation, emphasizing the seriousness of rejecting the Gospel.<p><b>when you leave that town</b><br>The instruction to leave the town indicates that the disciples were not to persist in a place where the message was not received. This reflects a strategic approach to ministry, focusing efforts where there is openness to the Gospel. It also highlights the urgency of their mission, as they were to cover as much ground as possible in spreading the message of the Kingdom.<p><b>as a testimony against them.</b><br>The act of shaking the dust off their feet served as a testimony against those who rejected the message. It was a public declaration that the town had been given the opportunity to hear the Gospel and had chosen to reject it. This echoes the prophetic tradition where actions often served as signs or testimonies (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>). It underscores the accountability of those who hear the Gospel and the consequences of rejecting it, aligning with the broader biblical theme of judgment for unbelief (e.g., <a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is instructing His disciples on how to conduct their ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being sent out to preach the Kingdom of God and heal the sick.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_towns.htm">The Towns</a></b><br>Various unnamed locations where the disciples are sent to minister.

He made clear that not everyone would receive them. The refusal is more than personal discourtesy&#8212;it is a rejection of the One who sent them (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently warns that the gospel divides (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). So, rejection should never surprise believers; it verifies the truthfulness of Jesus&#8217; words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shake the dust off your feet</b><p>- In Jewish practice, travelers sometimes shook foreign dust from their sandals when re-entering Israel to avoid defilement. Jesus applies the gesture to Israel itself: a visible declaration that those who spurn the gospel stand outside covenant blessing (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>).<p>- The apostles later used the same sign in Pisidian Antioch when their message was resisted (<a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a>). It conveyed both separation and warning&#8212;an acted-out indictment that responsibility for unbelief rests on the rejecters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when you leave that town</b><p>- The instruction prevents endless wrangling. After faithful witness, the disciples were to move on, investing time where hearts were open (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>).<p>- This does not license impatience or lack of compassion; Jesus Himself wept over the unresponsive (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>). Yet there comes a moment to entrust hardened hearers to God and continue the mission (<a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a testimony against them</b><p>- The dust-shaking becomes evidence in God&#8217;s court that light was offered and refused (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p>- On the day of judgment it will be &#8220;more tolerable for Sodom&#8221; than for those who knowingly rejected Christ&#8217;s messengers (<a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a>).<p>- The action also reminds believers that the message, not personal success, is what ultimately matters. Results belong to God; obedience belongs to the messenger (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a> teaches that when the gospel is faithfully presented and still rejected, disciples are to disengage, leaving a clear, solemn witness that refusal has serious consequences. The verse underscores personal responsibility to respond to God&#8217;s revealed truth, frees messengers from fruitless debate, and highlights the urgency of taking the good news to the next waiting soul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">A testimony against them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a testimony unto them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very duet from your feet for a testimony against</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. It was the custom of the Jews when they returned from foreign (Gentile) lands, as they crossed the frontiers of the Holy Land, to shake the dust from off their feet. This was an act symbolizing that they had broken, now on their return to their own land, all communion with Gentile peoples which a residence among them had necessitated for a season. The bitter hatred and loathing of the Jews, after their return from the Captivity, for all Gentile races can only be understood by the student of the Talmud. So comprehensive and perfect a hatred, enduring, too, for centuries, has never been witnessed in the case of any other peoples. This accounts in great measure for the retaliative persecution which more or less has been carried on all through the Christian era against this marvellous race. In our day - the day of a liberalism possibly exaggerated and unreal - in many parts of Europe the untrained sense of the <span class="accented">masses</span> strangely revolts against this spirit of toleration; and wild excesses, massacres, and bitter persecution - the <span class="accented">Judenhetz</span>, hatred of the Jews in Germany and in Russia - are among the curious results of the liberality and universal toleration of the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hosoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
