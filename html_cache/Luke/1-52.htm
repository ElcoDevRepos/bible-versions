Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as sovereign over all nations and rulers. Historical examples include the fall of Pharaoh in Exodus, the downfall of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, and the demise of Herod in Acts. These events illustrate God's ability to humble the proud and powerful. The phrase also echoes the prophetic tradition found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>, which speaks of God reducing rulers to nothing. This theme is consistent with the biblical narrative that emphasizes God's ultimate authority over earthly powers.<p><b>but has exalted the humble</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's favor towards the humble and lowly, a recurring theme in Scripture. The exaltation of the humble is seen in the lives of biblical figures like David, who was chosen as king despite his humble beginnings as a shepherd, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, who was a young, humble woman chosen to bear the Messiah. This concept is further reinforced in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus blesses the poor in spirit and the meek. The exaltation of the humble is a key aspect of God's kingdom, where the last shall be first, and the first shall be last (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). This principle is also a type of Christ, who, though being in very nature God, humbled Himself and was exalted by God (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who is speaking these words as part of her Magnificat, a song of praise to God for His mighty works and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers.htm">Rulers</a></b><br>Symbolic of those in positions of power and authority who are often prideful and self-reliant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_humble.htm">The Humble</a></b><br>Those who are lowly in spirit, often marginalized or oppressed, who rely on God rather than their own strength.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_magnificat.htm">The Magnificat</a></b><br>The song of Mary found in <a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>, expressing themes of God's justice, mercy, and reversal of human expectations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The overarching theme of God's control and intervention in human affairs, as He lifts the humble and brings down the proud.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_reversal_of_human_expectations.htm">God's Reversal of Human Expectations</a></b><br>God's kingdom operates on principles that often reverse worldly values.
