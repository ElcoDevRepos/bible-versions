This posture indicates a relaxed and intimate setting, suggesting fellowship and acceptance. The act of reclining also reflects the customs of the Passover meal, which Jesus had recently celebrated with His disciples. This setting emphasizes the hospitality and communion shared between Jesus and the two disciples on the road to Emmaus.<p><b>He took bread</b><br>Bread is a staple food in the biblical world and holds significant symbolic meaning throughout Scripture. It represents sustenance and life, as seen in the Lord's Prayer ("Give us this day our daily bread") and in Jesus' declaration, "I am the bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The act of taking bread here recalls the Last Supper, where Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper, symbolizing His body given for humanity.<p><b>spoke a blessing</b><br>In Jewish tradition, it was customary to offer a blessing before breaking bread, acknowledging God's provision. This blessing would typically be a prayer of thanksgiving, recognizing God as the source of all sustenance. Jesus' act of blessing the bread highlights His role as the mediator between God and humanity, and it echoes the blessings He gave during the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>).<p><b>and broke it</b><br>Breaking bread is a significant act that symbolizes sharing and community. In the context of the Last Supper, it represents Jesus' body broken for the salvation of mankind. This act of breaking bread with the disciples on the road to Emmaus serves as a reminder of Jesus' sacrifice and the new covenant established through His death and resurrection.<p><b>and gave it to them</b><br>The giving of bread signifies Jesus' role as the provider and sustainer. It also reflects the hospitality and generosity expected in the Kingdom of God. This act of giving is reminiscent of Jesus' earlier miracles, such as the feeding of the multitudes, where He provided abundantly for those in need. In this moment, the disciples' eyes are opened, and they recognize Jesus, illustrating the revelation and understanding that comes through fellowship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who reveals Himself to His disciples through the breaking of bread.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus, one named Cleopas, who were traveling to Emmaus and encountered the risen Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village about seven miles from Jerusalem where the disciples were heading when they met Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breaking_of_bread.htm">The Breaking of Bread</a></b><br>A significant act where Jesus reveals His identity to the disciples, reminiscent of the Last Supper.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_table.htm">The Table</a></b><br>The setting for this intimate and revelatory moment, symbolizing fellowship and communion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_through_communion.htm">Recognition Through Communion</a></b><br>The act of breaking bread is a means through which Jesus reveals Himself to His followers.

Luke has already stressed His bodily resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a>; 24:36&#8211;43), so this detail underlines that Jesus is physically present, not a vision.<p>&#8226; Reclining speaks of friendship and welcome. It recalls earlier moments of intimate fellowship such as <a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23</a> and anticipates the promise of <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where He still longs to &#8220;eat with&#8221; those who open the door.<p>&#8226; The Lord meets us in the midst of everyday hospitality; He does not wait for a synagogue service to reveal Himself. He comes where hearts are open, even if minds are still confused.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He took bread</b><p>&#8226; Jesus chooses the most common item on the table. In doing so He echoes the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>), reminding us that He is the true Passover sacrifice.<p>&#8226; This simple act whispers, &#8220;I am the Bread of Life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The resurrection proves that His promise of eternal satisfaction is no empty claim.<p>&#8226; The disciples will later practice &#8220;breaking bread from house to house&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>). What He handles here, they will soon share everywhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>spoke a blessing</b><p>&#8226; The customary Jewish berakah (&#8220;Blessed are You, O Lord&#8230;&#8221;) rises from His lips, showing that even in resurrection glory He models thankfulness. Luke&#8217;s Gospel often pairs Jesus&#8217; miracles with thanksgiving (<a href="/luke/9-16.htm">Luke 9:16</a>; 17:16).<p>&#8226; By blessing the Father, Jesus sanctifies the meal (<a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4&#8211;5</a>). No food is too ordinary to become holy when received with gratitude.<p>&#8226; Gratitude opens spiritual eyes. The moment of blessing prepares the moment of recognition in verse 31.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and broke it</b><p>&#8226; The breaking is deliberate, echoing His words from the upper room: &#8220;This is My body given for you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It points to the prophecy fulfilled on Calvary: &#8220;He was pierced for our transgressions&#8230; by His stripes we are healed&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Resurrection does not erase the cross; it vindicates it.

Revelation follows reception; obedience unlocks understanding.<p>&#8226; The pattern continues: what He gives to them, they will give to others&#8212;Peter&#8217;s Pentecost sermon offers &#8220;the gift of the Holy Spirit&#8221; to all who repent (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus still offers Himself today.

His physical presence, His choice of simple bread, His thankful blessing, His reminder of the cross, and His generous giving all reveal who He is: the living Lord who still invites us to table fellowship. When we welcome Him, give thanks, remember His sacrifice, and receive His gift, our eyes too are opened to recognize the Savior who walks beside us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">He took bread, and blessed it.</span>--Had the two travellers been of the number of the Twelve, we might have thought of the words and acts as reminding them of their last Supper with their Lord. As it was, we must think of those words and acts as meant to teach them, and, through them, others, the same lesson that had then been taught to the Twelve, that it would be in the "breaking of bread" that they would hereafter come to recognise their Master's presence. And they, too, we must remember, whether they were of the Seventy, or among the wider company of disciples, must have had memories, it may be of multitudes fed with the scanty provision of a few barley loaves, it may be of quiet evenings without a multitude, when they had looked on the same act, and heard the same words of blessing. This meal, too, became so full of spiritual significance that we may well anticipate the technical language of theology and say that it was to them "sacramental."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed</span> it, <span class="cmt_word">and brake, and gave to them</span>. There was a deep significance in the concluding act of this memorable appearance of the risen Lord. This taking the bread, and blessing it, and breaking it, and then giving it to them, was no ordinary act of courtesy, or welcome, or friendship, which, from a master or teacher might be shown to his disciples. It resembles too closely the great sacramental act in the upper room, when Jesus was alone with his apostles, for us to mistake its solemn sacramental character. The great teachers of the Church in different ages have generally so understood it. So Chrysostom in the Eastern, and Augustine in the Western Church; so Theophylact, and later Beza the Reformer all affirm that this meal was the sacrament. It taught men generally, even more plainly than did the first sacred institution teach the twelve, that in this solemn breaking of bread the Church would recognize their Master's presence. So generally, in fact, has this Emmaus "breaking of bread" been recognized by the Catholic Church as the sacrament, that later Romanist divines have even pressed it as a scriptural demonstration for the abuse which administered the elements under one form (compare, for instance, the 'Refutation of the Confession of Angsberg,' quoted by Stier, in his comment on this passage of Luke, 'Words of the Lord Jesus'). How unnecessary and forced such a construction is, Bishop Wordsworth points out in his note on Luke 24:30, "It may be remembered that <span class="accented">bread</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)was to the Jews a general name for <span class="accented">food</span>, including drink as well as meat Thus <span class="accented">bread</span> became spiritually an expressive term for all the blessings received from communion in Christ's body and blood, and the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or ' breaking of bread,' was suggestive of the source from which these blessings flow, (viz.) Christ's body (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) broken (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>); hence <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a> is a general term for the Holy Eucharist." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
