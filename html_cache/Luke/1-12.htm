This moment occurs in the Holy Place, a sacred area where priests performed their duties. The appearance of an angel in this setting is significant, as divine messengers often appear in critical moments of biblical history. Gabriel, known for delivering important messages from God, also appears to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>) and later to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). The presence of an angel signifies a divine intervention and a pivotal moment in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>he was startled</b><br>The reaction of being startled is common in biblical accounts of angelic appearances. Angels, as supernatural beings, often evoke fear and awe due to their divine nature and the unexpectedness of their presence. This response is seen in other biblical figures, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22</a>) and Manoah (<a href="/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20-22</a>). The startling nature of the encounter underscores the holiness and power associated with God's messengers.<p><b>and gripped with fear</b><br>Fear is a natural human response to the divine, reflecting the recognition of God's holiness and the awareness of human sinfulness. In the cultural context of the time, fear of the divine was common, as it was believed that seeing an angel could be a portent of death or judgment. However, in this instance, the fear serves as a prelude to a message of hope and fulfillment of prophecy. The fear experienced by Zechariah parallels the fear felt by others who encounter the divine, such as the shepherds at Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>) and the women at the empty tomb (<a href="/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5-6</a>). This fear often transitions to reassurance and revelation, as God's plans unfold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, serving in the temple.

This was not a vision in his mind but a visible encounter in the physical world&#8212;just as Hagar &#8220;called the name of the LORD who had spoken to her, &#8216;You are the God who sees me&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>).<p>- The location in the temple underscores the sacred reality of what Zechariah witnessed. Similar moments of divine appearance in holy places include Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>) and Isaiah in the throne room vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>).<p>- Seeing an angel often marks a turning point in Scripture&#8212;think of Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12-14</a> or Daniel in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a>. God&#8217;s messengers arrive with purpose, signaling that something significant for His redemptive plan is unfolding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was startled</b><p>- The suddenness of an angelic appearance normally produces shock. The shepherds outside Bethlehem reacted the same way: &#8220;And the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p>- Startlement highlights the contrast between the ordinary rhythm of human life and the extraordinary intrusion of the heavenly realm.<p>- Moments of divine interruption often begin with alarm but end with assurance (cf. <a href="/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6-8</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-7</a>). God&#8217;s pattern is to move His servants from surprise to faith-filled obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gripped with fear</b><p>- The response goes beyond a quick scare; Zechariah is &#8220;gripped,&#8221; held fast by fear. When people encounter God or His emissaries, a weighty sense of holiness presses in. John fell &#8220;at His feet as though dead&#8221; before the risen Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe to me! &#8230; I am a man of unclean lips&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>- This fear is not irrational panic; it is reverent awe. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> teaches, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.&#8221; Zechariah&#8217;s trembling sets the stage for faith, because a low view of self and a high view of God prepare the heart to receive divine promises.<p>- The angel will immediately answer this fear with the reassuring words, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Zechariah&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), echoing God&#8217;s consistent graciousness toward His people (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Zechariah&#8217;s reaction in <a href="/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a> unfolds naturally: he sees a real angel in a sacred setting, is jolted by the sudden encounter, and is overwhelmed with reverent fear. Scripture shows that such encounters often begin with shock yet blossom into faith, because the God who makes Himself known also calms and commissions those He calls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">He was troubled.</span>--It lies in the nature of the case that during all the long years of Zachariah's ministration, he had seen no such manifestation.
