The Greek word for "anguish" here conveys a deep sense of agony and struggle. This moment reflects the weight of the impending crucifixion and the burden of bearing the sins of humanity. It connects to <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief."<p><b>He prayed more earnestly</b><br>Jesus' response to His anguish was to pray with increased intensity. This demonstrates His reliance on the Father and sets an example of turning to God in times of deep distress. The earnestness of His prayer is a model for believers, showing the importance of fervent prayer in seeking God's will. This moment is also a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which depicts the suffering and prayer of the Messiah.<p><b>and His sweat became like drops of blood</b><br>This phrase may refer to a rare medical condition known as hematidrosis, where extreme stress causes capillaries to burst, mixing blood with sweat.

The phenomenon described is obviously one which would have a special interest for one of St. Luke's calling, and the four words which he uses for "agony," "drops," "sweat," "more earnestly" (literally, <span class= "ital">more intensely</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> though not exclusively technical, are yet such as a medical writer would naturally use. They do not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The form of the expression, "<span class= "ital">as it were,</span> great drops (better, <span class= "ital">clots</span>) of blood," leaves us uncertain, as the same Greek word does in "descending <span class= "ital">like</span> a dove," in <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>, whether it applies to manner or to visible appearance. On the latter, and generally received view, the phenomenon is not unparalleled, both in ancient and modern times. (Comp. the very term, "bloody sweat," noted as a symptom of extreme exhaustion in Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Hist. Anim.</span> iii.19, and <span class= "ital">Medical Gazette</span> for December, 1848, quoted by Alford.) If we ask who were St. Luke's informants, we may think either, as before, of one of the disciples, or, possibly, one of the women from whom, as above, he manifestly derived so much that he records. That "bloody sweat" must have left its traces upon the tunic that our Lord wore, and when the soldiers cast lots for it (<a href="/matthew/27-35.htm" title="And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and on my clothing did they cast lots.">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="/john/19-24.htm" title="They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.">John 19:24</a>), Mary Magdalene, who stood by the cross, may have seen and noticed the fact (<a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>), nor could it well have escaped the notice of Nicodemus and Joseph when they embalmed the body (<a href="/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling</span> <span class="cmt_word">down to the ground</span>. Some (for instance, Theophylact) understand this "as it were" to signify that the expression, "drops of blood," was simply parabolic; but it is far better to understand the words in their literal sense, as our Church does when it prays, "By thine agony and bloody sweat." Athanasius even goes so far as to pronounce a ban upon those who deny this sweat of blood. Commentators give instances of this blood-sweat under abnormal pathological circumstances. Some, though by no means all, of the oldest authorities omit these last two verses (43, 44). Their omission in many of these ancient manuscripts was probably due to mistaken reverence. The two oldest and most authoritative translations, the Itala (Latin) and Peshito (Syriac), contain them, however, as do the most important Fathers of the second century, Justin and Irenaeus. We have, then, apart from the evidence of manuscripts, the testimony of the earliest Christianity in Italy and Syria, Asia Minor and Gaul, to the genuineness of these two famous verses. They are printed in the ordinary text of the Revised English Version, with a side-note alluding to their absence in some of the ancient authorities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in [His]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
