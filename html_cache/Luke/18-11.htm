In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, Pharisees were respected religious leaders known for their strict observance of the Torah. This posture of standing apart can symbolize both physical and spiritual separation, highlighting the Pharisee's belief in his own righteousness. The act of praying in public was common, but the Pharisee's prayer is more self-congratulatory than supplicatory, contrasting with the humility expected in prayer as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5-6</a>.<p><b>&#8216;God, I thank You that I am not like other men&#8212;</b><br>The Pharisee begins his prayer with thanksgiving, which is a common Jewish practice. However, his gratitude is not directed towards God's grace or mercy but rather towards his own perceived moral superiority. This reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of true righteousness, which is not based on comparison with others but on one's relationship with God. The Pharisee's attitude is reminiscent of the self-righteousness condemned by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where outward appearances are criticized when they do not reflect inner purity.<p><b>swindlers, evildoers, adulterers&#8212;</b><br>The Pharisee lists specific sins, which were commonly condemned in Jewish law and society. Swindlers, evildoers, and adulterers represent those who violate both social and divine laws. By listing these sins, the Pharisee attempts to elevate his own status by comparison. This reflects a legalistic mindset that focuses on external actions rather than internal transformation, contrasting with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of the heart's condition (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>).<p><b>or even like this tax collector.</b><br>Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society for their collaboration with the Roman occupiers and their reputation for extortion. By comparing himself to the tax collector, the Pharisee underscores his perceived moral superiority. This comparison highlights the social and religious divide between the Pharisees and those considered sinners. However, Jesus often used tax collectors as examples of repentance and humility, as seen in the story of Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19.htm">Luke 19:1-10</a>), challenging the prevailing social norms and emphasizing God's grace and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisee.htm">Pharisee</a></b><br>A member of an ancient Jewish sect, known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Scripture consistently teaches that all people stand equally needy before a holy God and that true justification comes through humble faith, not inflated piety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself.</span>--A false stress has often been laid on the Pharisee's attitude, as though his standing erect was in itself an indication of his self-righteous pride. But the publican also stood, and although another tense of the same verb is used, it is an over-subtle refinement to see this difference between the two forms. Standing was, indeed, with the Jews, the customary attitude of prayer. The self-same participle is used here of the Pharisee, and in <a href="/luke/19-8.htm" title="And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.">Luke 19:8</a> of Zacchaeus. The order of the words in the Greek is "standing by (or, <span class= "ital">with</span>) himself, prayed thus (or, <span class= "ital">as follows</span>);" and it is a question of punctuation whether the words point to the Pharisee's standing "by himself," shrinking from contact with others, and so making himself the "observed of all observers," or, as in the Authorised version, that he "prayed with himself." The general use of the preposition is all but decisive in favour of the latter view. It does not follow, however, as has been somewhat hastily assumed, that the prayer was a silent one, that even he would not have dared to utter aloud such a boast as that which follows. There was nothing in the character of the typical Pharisee to lead him to any such sense of shame; and silent prayer, never customary among the Jews at any time, would have been at variance with every tradition of the Pharisees. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-7.htm" title="But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.">Matthew 6:7</a>). So far as the phrase has any special point, it indicates that he was not praying to God at all; he was practically praying to himself, congratulating himself, half-consciously, that he had no need to pray, in the sense of asking for pardon, or peace, or righteousness, though it might be right, by way of example, to perform his acts of devotion and to thank God for what he had received. The words remind us--(1) of the title which Marcus Aurelius gave to his Stoic <span class= "ital">Meditations</span>--"<span class= "ital">Thoughts</span> (or better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">communings</span>)<span class= "ital"> with himself"</span>--in which he, too, begins with thanksgiving and self-gratulations on the progress he had made in virtue from his youth onward (<span class= "ital">Meditt.</span> i. 1); (2) of the more modern theory which recognises the value of prayer as raising the thoughts of man to a higher level, by a kind of self-mesmerising action, but excludes from it altogether the confession of sin, or the supplication for pardon, or the "making our wants known unto God" (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a>). The verb for "prayed" is in the tense which implies continuance. He was making a long address, of which this was a sample (<a href="/luke/20-47.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.">Luke 20:47</a>).<p><span class= "bld">God, I thank thee . . .</span>--We cannot say that the formula, as a formula, was wrong. We are bound to thank God that we have been kept from sins. But all devout minds, and all rightly-constructed liturgies, have recognised the truth that confession must come first, and that without it thanksgiving is merely the utterance of a serene self-satisfaction in outward comforts, or, as here, of spiritual pride. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are</span>. How closely drawn from the life is this picture of a Pharisee will be seen by a comparison of the prayer here with the prayer of a rabbi contained in the Talmud. When Rabbi Nechounia Ben Hakana left his school, he used to say, "I thank thee, O Eternal, my God, for having given me part with those who attend this school instead of running through the shops. I rise early like them, but it is to study the Law, not for futile ends. I take trouble as they do, but I shall be rewarded, and they will not. We run alike, but I for the future life, while they will only arrive at the pit of destruction" (from the treatise 'Berachath'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
