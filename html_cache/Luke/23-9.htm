Known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist, Herod was curious about Jesus, having heard of His miracles and teachings. This encounter takes place during Jesus' trial, after Pilate sent Him to Herod, as Jesus was a Galilean. Herod's questioning likely stemmed from a mix of curiosity and political intrigue, as he sought to understand Jesus' claims and possibly witness a miracle. The setting is Herod's palace in Jerusalem, where he was staying for the Passover festival, a time when Jewish leaders and Roman authorities were particularly vigilant about potential uprisings.<p><b>but He gave no answer</b><br>Jesus' silence before Herod fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth. This silence can be seen as a demonstration of Jesus' submission to God's will and His understanding of the futility of defending Himself before a ruler who was not genuinely seeking truth. It also highlights Jesus' role as the Lamb of God, willingly going to the cross without protest. His silence contrasts with His earlier responses to Pilate, indicating a discernment of Herod's insincerity and lack of spiritual insight. This moment underscores the fulfillment of His mission and the prophetic nature of His suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The ruler of Galilee and Perea, Herod was curious about Jesus and had long desired to see Him perform a miracle.

Did the Prisoner who stood before him really claim to be a King? Did He proclaim Himself as the Christ? Was He John the Baptist, risen from the dead? If not, who and what were his earthly parents?
