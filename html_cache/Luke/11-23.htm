In the context of <a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>, Jesus is addressing the spiritual conflict between the kingdom of God and the forces of evil. The statement underscores the impossibility of neutrality in spiritual matters. Historically, this reflects the Jewish understanding of loyalty and covenant, where one is either for God or against Him. Theologically, it aligns with the broader biblical narrative that calls for wholehearted devotion to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where Joshua challenges the Israelites to choose whom they will serve. This phrase also echoes the dualistic nature of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are called to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.<p><b>and he who does not gather with Me scatters</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the active role required in following Jesus. Gathering with Him implies working towards the same purpose and mission, which is the advancement of God's kingdom. The imagery of gathering versus scattering can be connected to the agricultural practices of the time, where gathering was associated with harvest and productivity, while scattering implied loss and destruction. This concept is further illustrated in <a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>, where the hired hand abandons the sheep, causing them to scatter. Theologically, it points to the unity and purpose found in Christ, as opposed to the division and chaos that result from opposing Him. This phrase also serves as a warning against complacency and the consequences of not actively participating in the mission of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the spiritual battle and the necessity of choosing sides in the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Jesus is addressing a crowd that includes both His followers and skeptics, emphasizing the importance of allegiance to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spiritual_realm.htm">The Spiritual Realm</a></b><br>The context of this verse involves Jesus discussing spiritual warfare and the casting out of demons, highlighting the reality of spiritual forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/allegiance_to_christ.htm">Allegiance to Christ</a></b><br>Jesus demands a clear decision.

Our Lord here is referring to the exorcists, and contrasting <span class="accented">their</span> imperfect work with <span class="accented">his</span>, showing how hopeless a task it was to attempt to combat the evil one and his satellites apart from him - Christ. It is particularly to be noticed that Jesus neither here nor elsewhere charges these with imposture. Pretence and ridiculous spells and incantations were doubtless constantly mixed up with their attempts to exorcise; indeed, the term used to describe them in <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a> is one of contempt; but Jesus assumes in his argument here, what was no doubt the fact, that in these cases there was often, in the person of the physician-exorcist, earnestness and prayer mingled with the deepest pity for the unhappy sufferer, and before these there is no doubt that, in the less severe cases of possession, the evil influence or spirit yielded, and for a time at least let go his victim. "See," said the Master, "he that is not with me is against me in this dire conflict against evil;" for these would-be exorcists were utterly unable, even in those instances where they expelled the devil, to render him powerless to do mischief for the future. "<span class="accented">My</span> power sent these dread beings to the abyss, there to wait. The would-be exorcists were unable to replace the hellish tenant which they expelled by another and a holier influence. <span class="accented">I</span> bring back the once-tormented soul to its old relations with its God-Friend, and replace the unclean spirit by the Holy Spirit."
