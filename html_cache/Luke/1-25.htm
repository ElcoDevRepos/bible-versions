In the biblical context, barrenness was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor or personal failure. Elizabeth's acknowledgment of the Lord's action highlights her faith and understanding that her pregnancy is a miraculous act of God. This mirrors other biblical instances where God intervenes in the lives of women who were previously barren, such as Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>) and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>), emphasizing God's sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises.<p><b>In these days</b><br>The timing of Elizabeth's pregnancy is significant. It occurs during a period of heightened messianic expectation among the Jewish people. The phrase "in these days" suggests a specific divine timing, aligning with God's redemptive plan. This period is marked by Roman occupation and a longing for deliverance, setting the stage for the coming of the Messiah. Elizabeth's pregnancy, therefore, is not just a personal blessing but part of a larger divine narrative.<p><b>He has shown me favor</b><br>The concept of divine favor is central to the biblical narrative. Favor, or grace, is often associated with God's unmerited kindness and blessing. Elizabeth's experience of favor is reminiscent of Mary, who is also described as having found favor with God (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). This favor is not just about personal blessing but is connected to God's larger salvific purposes. It underscores the theme of God's grace being extended to the humble and faithful.<p><b>and taken away my disgrace among the people.</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, childlessness was often viewed as a social stigma and a source of personal shame. Elizabeth's reference to "disgrace" highlights the societal pressures and personal anguish associated with barrenness. By granting her a child, God not only fulfills her personal longing but also restores her honor in the community. This act of removing disgrace is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God lifts the downtrodden and vindicates the righteous, as seen in the stories of Leah (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>) and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b><br>The wife of Zechariah, a priest, and a relative of Mary, the mother of Jesus.

After decades of waiting (<a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7</a>), Elizabeth experiences a moment when God&#8217;s favor becomes visible.<p>&#8226; Favor means gracious kindness. The angel used the same idea when greeting Mary: &#8220;You are highly favored&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-28.htm">Luke 1:28</a>). God&#8217;s favor rests on those He chooses, not because of their merit but because of His gracious purpose (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a> provides a striking parallel: &#8220;Then God remembered Rachel; He listened to her and opened her womb.&#8221; Both Rachel and Elizabeth discover that God&#8217;s timing governs favor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a> asks, &#8220;Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion.&#8221; Elizabeth now lives that satisfaction, proving that God&#8217;s timing is perfect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And taken away my disgrace among the people</b><p>&#8226; In ancient Israel, childlessness carried social stigma.
