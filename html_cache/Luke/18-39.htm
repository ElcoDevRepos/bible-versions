The admonishment to be silent reflects a cultural norm where individuals of lower social status, such as beggars or the disabled, were often marginalized and expected to remain unobtrusive. This moment highlights the societal barriers that existed, where the voices of the needy were frequently suppressed. The leaders' attempt to silence the blind man underscores a recurring theme in the Gospels: the tension between societal expectations and the radical inclusivity of Jesus' ministry. This phrase also connects to other instances in the Gospels where individuals are rebuked for seeking Jesus' attention, such as the disciples rebuking those bringing children to Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13-16</a>).<p><b>but he cried out all the louder</b><br>The blind man's persistence in crying out demonstrates his desperation and faith. Despite being rebuked, his determination to reach Jesus is unwavering. This act of crying out louder can be seen as a demonstration of faith, similar to the persistent widow earlier in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, who continually sought justice. The blind man's actions reflect a deep belief in Jesus' ability to heal and a refusal to be deterred by societal pressures. This persistence is a model of faith that overcomes obstacles, echoing the biblical principle that faith often requires boldness and perseverance.<p><b>&#8220;Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221;</b><br>The title "Son of David" is a messianic term, acknowledging Jesus as the promised descendant of David who would establish God's kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). By using this title, the blind man is expressing his belief in Jesus as the Messiah. This acknowledgment is significant, as it shows an understanding of Jesus' true identity, which many others, including religious leaders, failed to recognize. The plea for mercy is a common biblical theme, reflecting a recognition of one's need for divine grace and compassion. This cry for mercy is reminiscent of the Psalms, where the psalmists often appeal to God's mercy in times of distress (<a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>). The blind man's request is both a personal plea for healing and a profound theological statement about Jesus' identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/blind_beggar.htm">Blind Beggar</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, a blind man who persistently calls out to Jesus for mercy, demonstrating faith and determination.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Son of David," acknowledging His messianic title and lineage, and the one from whom the beggar seeks mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd/those_who_led_the_way.htm">Crowd/Those Who Led the Way</a></b><br>The people accompanying Jesus, who attempt to silence the blind beggar, representing societal barriers to faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, a city with historical significance in Israel's history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_david.htm">Son of David</a></b><br>A messianic title used by the blind beggar, recognizing Jesus as the promised descendant of King David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/persistence_in_faith.htm">Persistence in Faith</a></b><br>The blind beggar's refusal to be silenced teaches us the importance of persistent faith, even when faced with opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus'_authority.htm">Recognizing Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>By calling Jesus "Son of David," the beggar acknowledges His messianic authority, reminding us to recognize and submit to Jesus' lordship in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_societal_barriers.htm">Overcoming Societal Barriers</a></b><br>The crowd's attempt to silence the beggar highlights societal barriers to faith, encouraging us to overcome obstacles that hinder our spiritual journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_mercy.htm">Seeking Mercy</a></b><br>The beggar's cry for mercy is a model for our prayers, emphasizing humility and dependence on God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_personal_encounter_with_jesus.htm">The Power of a Personal Encounter with Jesus</a></b><br>This event underscores the transformative power of a personal encounter with Jesus, leading to both physical and spiritual healing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_18_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 18:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_persist_in_faith_amid_rebuke.htm">How can we persist in faith when others "rebuked him to be silent"?
