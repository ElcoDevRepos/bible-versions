The account of this transaction is less circumstantial in St. Luke than in the other evangelists. The reference to the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> is here left out. This prophecy is, however, necessary for the full understanding of the mystic act of riding upon an ass's colt. St. Luke, compiling especially for Gentile readers, would feel that such a reference to the old Hebrew story would scarcely interest a foreigner, and would serve to distract such a one's interest in the progress of the great recital. For us, however, the meaning of the scene, read in the light of the <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> words and of Hebrew story generally, is as follows: The disciples and multitude wished their Master to claim a kingdom. At this moment in his eventful history, aware that death awaited him in the course of the next few days, he chose to gratify them; so he claimed his kingdom, but a kingdom utterly unlike what <span class="accented">they</span> longed for. He came to his royal, sacred city in the strange guise foreshadowed by Zechariah, as a Prince of Peace, not with chariot and horse, but meekly riding on an ass's colt, claiming, too, a dominion from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth (<a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). <span class="accented">Whereon yet never man sat.</span> For this reason specially adapted for a sacred use (see <a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#960;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hypagete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5217.htm">Strong's 5217: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go away, depart, begone, die.
