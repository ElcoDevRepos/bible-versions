It is part of the Olivet Discourse, a prophetic teaching given by Jesus on the Mount of Olives. This discourse is recorded in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 24, <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, and <a href="/luke/21.htm">Luke 21</a>) and addresses the end times and the signs preceding them. Jesus is preparing His followers for future events, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and faithfulness.<p><b>Nation will rise against nation</b><br>This phrase suggests widespread conflict and warfare, a common theme in eschatological prophecies. Historically, such conflicts have been seen as precursors to significant changes or divine intervention. The phrase echoes Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a>, where God speaks of stirring up Egyptians against Egyptians. It also aligns with the apocalyptic imagery in the Book of Revelation, where wars and rumors of wars are signs of the end times (<a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>).<p><b>and kingdom against kingdom</b><br>This expands the scope of conflict from individual nations to larger political entities, suggesting a time of global turmoil. In the historical context, the Roman Empire was a dominant force, and the idea of kingdoms clashing would resonate with the audience familiar with Roman conquests and internal strife. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly powers compared to the eternal kingdom of God. It also connects to Daniel's visions of empires rising and falling, ultimately leading to God's everlasting kingdom (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is addressing His disciples about the signs of the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to understand the signs of the times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_kingdoms.htm">Nations and Kingdoms</a></b><br>Refers to the geopolitical entities that will experience conflict, symbolizing widespread turmoil and unrest in the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' words remind us that conflict among nations is a sign of the times, urging believers to be vigilant and discerning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the chaos in the world, Christians are called to trust in God's ultimate control and plan for history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_prayer_and_peace.htm">Call to Prayer and Peace</a></b><br>In light of global conflicts, believers should be committed to prayer for peace and be peacemakers in their communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_persecution.htm">Preparation for Persecution</a></b><br>As conflicts increase, so may persecution of believers.
