It emphasizes the importance of taking initiative in treating others well, rather than passively waiting for others to act first. This teaching is part of Jesus' Sermon on the Plain, which parallels the Sermon on the Mount in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5-7</a>. The context is Jesus addressing His disciples and a large crowd, emphasizing the radical nature of His kingdom values. The call to "do" reflects the active nature of love and righteousness, which is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>, <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>).<p><b>as you would have them</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the empathetic and reciprocal nature of the command. It requires self-reflection and understanding of one's own desires and needs, which then informs how one should treat others. This principle is rooted in the Old Testament law, such as <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which commands love for one's neighbor. It also aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and fairness, as seen in the prophets' calls for equitable treatment (e.g., <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>do to you.</b><br>The conclusion of the verse underscores the expectation of mutual respect and kindness. It implies a universal standard of behavior that transcends cultural and historical contexts. This teaching is often referred to as the "Golden Rule" and is a summary of the ethical teachings of Jesus. It reflects the character of God, who is just and loving, and calls His followers to embody these attributes. The principle is echoed in other New Testament writings, such as <a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8-10</a>, where love is seen as the fulfillment of the law. This teaching also foreshadows the sacrificial love of Christ, who exemplified this principle through His life and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is delivering a sermon often referred to as the "Sermon on the Plain," which includes teachings on love, mercy, and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, including the Twelve Apostles and a larger group of followers who were learning from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_multitude.htm">The Multitude</a></b><br>A larger crowd gathered to hear Jesus, consisting of people from various regions, including Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal regions of Tyre and Sidon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_reciprocity.htm">The Principle of Reciprocity</a></b><br>Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a> is a call to proactive love and kindness.
