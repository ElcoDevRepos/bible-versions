In biblical times, a banquet was a significant social event, often symbolizing joy, celebration, and fellowship. The timing of the banquet is crucial, as it reflects God's perfect timing in His divine plan. The banquet can be seen as a metaphor for the Kingdom of God, where the invitation to partake is extended to all at the appointed time.<p><b>he sent his servant</b><br>The servant represents those who are called to deliver God's message, such as prophets, apostles, and evangelists. In the context of the parable, the servant acts on behalf of the master, symbolizing the role of Jesus Christ and His followers in proclaiming the Gospel. This action reflects the mission of the Church to reach out to those who are invited to the Kingdom.<p><b>to tell those who had been invited</b><br>This phrase highlights the pre-existing invitation, suggesting that the guests were already aware of the upcoming event. In Jewish culture, it was customary to send an initial invitation, followed by a reminder when the feast was ready. Spiritually, this can be seen as God's covenant relationship with Israel, who were the first to receive His promises. It also reflects the broader invitation to all humanity to enter into a relationship with God.<p><b>&#8216;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8217;</b><br>The call to "come" is an urgent invitation to partake in the blessings prepared by God. The readiness of "everything" signifies the completeness and sufficiency of God's provision through Jesus Christ. This echoes the fulfillment of prophecy and the readiness of the Kingdom of God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/22-4.htm">Matthew 22:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.

"The time of supper" is, in the primary application, the time of our Lord's coming, when the Kingdom of Heaven was first proclaimed as nigh at hand. All things--pardon, peace, blessedness--were now ready for those who would accept them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come; for all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuse</span>. The excuses, viewed as a whole, are paltry, and "if," as it has been well said, "as a mere story of natural life it seems highly improbable, it is because men's conduct with regard to the Divine kingdom is not according to right reason... The excuses are all of the nature of pretexts, not one of them being a valid reason for non-attendance at the feast." The fact was, the invited were pleased to be invited, but there the matter ended with them. The banquet, which they were proud to have been asked to share in, had no influence upon their everyday lives. They made their engagements for pleasure and for business without the least regard to the day or the hour of the banquet: indeed, they treated it with perfect indifference. The key to the parable is easily found. The Jews were "solemn triflers in the matter of religion. They were under invitation to enter the kingdom, and they did not assume the attitude of men who avowedly cared nothing for it. On the contrary, they were pleased to think that its privileges were theirs in offer, and even gave themselves credit for setting a high value on them. But in truth they did not. The kingdom of God had not by any means the first place in their esteem. They were men who talked much about the kingdom of heaven, yet cared little for it; who were very religious, yet very worldly - a class of which too many specimens exist in every age" (Professor Bruce, 'Parabolic Teaching'). I have bought a piece of ground... I have bought five yoke of oxen... I have married a wife, etc. These excuses, of course, by no means exhaust all possible cases. They simply represent examples of usual everyday causes of indifference to the kingdom of God. To all these excuses one thing is common - in each a present good is esteemed above the heavenly offer; in other words, temporal good is valued higher than spiritual. The three excuses may be classed under the following heads. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The attraction of property of different kinds, the absorbing delight of possessing earthly goods. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The occupations of business, the pleasure of increasing the store, of adding coin to coin, or field to field. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Social ties, whether at home or abroad, whether in general society or in the home circle; for even in the latter case it is too possible for family and domestic interests so completely to fill the heart as to leave no room there for higher and more unselfish aims, no place for any grander hopes than the poor narrow home-life affords. The primary application of all this was to the Jews of the Lord's own time. It was spoken, we must remember, to a gathering of the <span class="accented">Rite</span> of the Israel of his day. In the report of the servant detailing to the master the above-recorded excuses, it has been beautifully said, "we may hear the echo of the sorrowful lamentation uttered by Jesus over the hardening of the Jews during his long nights of prayer." The invitation to the feast was neglected by the learned and the powerful among the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When it was]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
