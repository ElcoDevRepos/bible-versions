In the context of <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, Jesus is speaking to His disciples after His resurrection. The opening of their minds signifies a supernatural enlightenment, allowing them to comprehend what was previously hidden. This act is reminiscent of the Old Testament instances where God grants wisdom and understanding, such as in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.<p><b>to understand the Scriptures</b><br>The Scriptures here refer to the Hebrew Bible, what Christians call the Old Testament. Jesus is helping the disciples see how the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings all point to Him as the Messiah. This understanding is crucial for the early church's teaching and preaching, as it forms the basis for the apostolic message found in Acts and the Epistles. The fulfillment of prophecies, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, becomes clear through this divine revelation. This moment is pivotal, as it transitions the disciples from confusion to clarity, enabling them to carry out the Great Commission with a full understanding of Jesus' mission and the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples and opens their minds to understand the Scriptures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present with Him and receive the opening of their minds.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and prophecy fulfillment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scriptures.htm">The Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), which Jesus explains to His disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The pivotal event that has just occurred, providing the context for Jesus' teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_jesus_in_understanding_scripture.htm">The Role of Jesus in Understanding Scripture</a></b><br>Jesus is central to understanding the Bible.

Among the new powers bestowed on them by this Divine gift, St. Luke especially dwells on the spiritual insight henceforth possessed by these men into the Scriptures of the Old Testament, hitherto only partly understood. This power was doubtless one of the great instruments of their success as preachers. In the next four verses (46-49) St. Luke evidently briefly summarizes the Master's great sayings, some probably spoken in the course of the walk to Emmaus, some on that first Easter evening, some on other occasions during the forty days which elapsed between the Resurrection and the Ascension. The introductory words, "and said unto them" (ver. 46), seem the commencement cf. this summary, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
