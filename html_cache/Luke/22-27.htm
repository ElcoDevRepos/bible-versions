Meals were significant social events, and those who reclined were typically the guests of honor or those of higher social standing. This question posed by Jesus challenges the conventional understanding of greatness and authority. In the Greco-Roman world, service was often associated with slaves or those of lower status, making Jesus' question provocative and counter-cultural.<p><b>Is it not the one who reclines?</b><br>This rhetorical question reflects the common societal belief that those who recline at the table are indeed greater. It acknowledges the prevailing norms of the time, where social hierarchy was clearly defined, and those with power and influence were served by others. This expectation is mirrored in other parts of the Gospels, where the disciples often argue about who among them is the greatest (e.g., <a href="/luke/9-46.htm">Luke 9:46</a>).<p><b>But I am among you as one who serves.</b><br>Here, Jesus presents Himself as the ultimate example of servant leadership, subverting the traditional views of power and greatness. This statement is a direct reference to His mission and character, as seen throughout His ministry. Jesus' life exemplifies humility and service, culminating in His sacrificial death on the cross. This phrase connects to <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, where Paul describes Jesus as taking the form of a servant. It also fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, highlighting Jesus as the Messiah who serves humanity through His life and atoning sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about true greatness through service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being instructed on the nature of leadership and service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, where Jesus shares a final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, significant as the center of Jewish religious life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>An underlying theme in Jesus' teaching, emphasizing the values of God's kingdom as opposed to worldly values.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_greatness.htm">The Paradox of Greatness</a></b><br>In God's kingdom, true greatness is found in humility and service, not in power or status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_example_of_christ.htm">The Example of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus, though Lord of all, chose to serve.

In everyday society&#8212;and even among the disciples in <a href="/luke/22-24.htm">Luke 22:24</a>&#8212;status is measured by power and prestige. Jesus calls attention to that thinking so He can overturn it. This mirrors His teaching in <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-26</a> that &#8220;the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them&#8230; Not so with you.&#8221;<p>Key takeaways:<p>- The world links greatness to position.<p>- Even believers can drift into that mindset (cf. <a href="/luke/9-46.htm">Luke 9:46</a>).<p>- Jesus always starts where His listeners are before redirecting them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the one who reclines at the table</b><p>In first-century banquets, the honored guests reclined, leaning on cushions while servants stood ready. Jesus&#8217; hearers knew exactly who looked important. This recalls His parable about choosing seats of honor (<a href="/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7-11</a>).<p>Points to notice:<p>- Reclining signals privilege and comfort.<p>- It exemplifies &#8220;first place&#8221; thinking that Jesus warns against in <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6-11</a>.<p>- Our culture has its own equivalents&#8212;corner offices, VIP sections&#8212;where self-importance still thrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or the one who serves?</b><p>A servant, by contrast, remains on his feet, attends to needs, and receives little recognition. Jesus&#8217; wording forces a contrast between visible honor and hidden service, much like His earlier words in <a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a> where He promises to serve faithful servants at His return.<p>Consider:<p>- Service often happens in the background, unnoticed by crowds.<p>- Throughout Scripture God elevates the humble (<a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p>- True greatness, therefore, cannot be anchored in external applause.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is it not the one who reclines?</b><p>Jesus answers according to common thinking: everyone assumes the recliner is greater. He lets that conclusion stand for a moment to expose its emptiness, echoing <a href="/luke/22-25.htm">Luke 22:25</a> where worldly rulers call themselves &#8220;Benefactors.&#8221;<p>Reflection:<p>- Human reasoning defaults to rank and privilege.<p>- Jesus repeatedly dismantles those assumptions (<a href="/mark/9-35.htm">Mark 9:35</a>).<p>- The disciples must recognize how deeply the world&#8217;s values have shaped them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I am among you as one who serves.</b><p>Here Jesus overturns the whole equation. Though rightfully &#8220;greater&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-18</a>), He chooses the servant&#8217;s role. Within hours He will illustrate this by washing feet (<a href="/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-15</a>) and by the cross itself (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p>Practical implications:<p>- Greatness in God&#8217;s kingdom equals humble, sacrificial service.<p>- Leaders are first servants (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p>- Every believer is called to imitate Christ&#8217;s pattern:<p>- Notice needs.<p>- Step in personally.<p>- Expect no earthly acclaim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a> contrasts society&#8217;s view of greatness with Christ&#8217;s. While people admire the one comfortably reclining, Jesus&#8212;rightly supreme&#8212;takes the lower place, modeling that true honor lies in self-giving service. His example calls every follower to measure greatness not by status, but by willingness to serve in love, trusting God to exalt the humble in His time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">I am among you as he that serveth.</span>--An obviously undesigned coincidence presents itself on a comparison of the words with the narrative of <a href="/context/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1-16</a>, where see Notes.
