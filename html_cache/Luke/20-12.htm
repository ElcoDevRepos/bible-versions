The sending of a third servant highlights God's persistent and patient attempts to reach His people despite their repeated rejections. This reflects the long-suffering nature of God, who desires repentance and reconciliation. The number three often signifies completeness or finality in biblical terms, suggesting that this was a significant and decisive attempt by God to communicate with His people.<p><b>but they wounded him</b><br>The act of wounding the servant indicates the increasing hostility and violence of the tenants, representing the escalating rejection and persecution of God's messengers by Israel. This mirrors the historical treatment of prophets like Jeremiah and Zechariah, who faced severe opposition and suffering. The wounding also foreshadows the suffering of Jesus Christ, the ultimate messenger and Son of God, who would be rejected and crucified.<p><b>and threw him out</b><br>The act of throwing the servant out signifies the complete rejection and dismissal of God's message and authority by the tenants. This reflects the broader rejection of God's covenant and commandments by Israel throughout history. It also prefigures the rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders, who would ultimately cast Him out of Jerusalem to be crucified. This phrase underscores the theme of rejection and the consequences of turning away from God's appointed messengers, culminating in the rejection of Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owner_of_the_vineyard.htm">The Owner of the Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents God, who has entrusted His vineyard (Israel) to the tenants (the religious leaders).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Symbolize the religious leaders of Israel who were responsible for leading the people but failed to do so faithfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>These are the prophets sent by God to call Israel back to righteousness, often rejected and mistreated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, whom He nurtured and expected to bear fruit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_servant.htm">The Third Servant</a></b><br>Another prophet sent by God, who, like the others, is mistreated and rejected by the tenants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_persistence.htm">God's Patience and Persistence</a></b><br>God repeatedly sends His messengers, demonstrating His patience and desire for repentance.
