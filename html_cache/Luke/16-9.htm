In the Gospels, Jesus often uses this phrase to introduce significant spiritual truths or principles. It underscores His role as a teacher and prophet, conveying divine wisdom.<p><b>use worldly wealth</b><br>Worldly wealth refers to material possessions and financial resources. In the context of first-century Judea, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet Jesus frequently taught about the dangers of relying on riches (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The term "worldly" suggests a temporary and earthly nature, contrasting with eternal values. Jesus is not condemning wealth itself but instructing on its proper use.<p><b>to make friends for yourselves</b><br>This phrase suggests using resources to build relationships that have lasting value. In the cultural context, hospitality and generosity were highly valued, and forming alliances through gifts was common. The idea is to invest in relationships that transcend earthly life, reflecting the principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-10</a>).<p><b>so that when it is gone</b><br>This acknowledges the transient nature of material wealth. Wealth can be lost or depleted, and ultimately, it cannot be taken beyond this life (<a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). Jesus emphasizes the inevitability of wealth's end, urging a focus on what endures beyond temporal existence.<p><b>they will welcome you into eternal dwellings</b><br>"Eternal dwellings" refers to the heavenly realm, a place of everlasting life with God. The imagery of being welcomed suggests a community aspect of the afterlife, where relationships formed on earth have eternal significance. This aligns with the biblical theme of storing treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>) and the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, which follows in <a href="/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>, illustrating the eternal consequences of earthly actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, providing teaching on the use of wealth and resources.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, representing followers of Christ who are learning about kingdom values.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/worldly_wealth.htm">Worldly Wealth</a></b><br>Refers to material possessions and financial resources, often seen as temporary and not eternal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_dwellings.htm">Eternal Dwellings</a></b><br>Symbolizes the eternal life and heavenly rewards that await believers who live according to God's principles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends.htm">Friends</a></b><br>Represents those who benefit from the believer's wise and generous use of resources, potentially leading them to faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_resources.htm">Stewardship of Resources</a></b><br>Believers are called to manage their resources wisely, recognizing that all wealth is ultimately God's and should be used for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Christians should prioritize eternal outcomes over temporary gains, using their wealth to impact lives for the kingdom of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_witness.htm">Generosity as Witness</a></b><br>By using wealth to bless others, believers can demonstrate the love of Christ and potentially lead others to faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/building_relationships.htm">Building Relationships</a></b><br>Investing in relationships through generosity can create opportunities for sharing the gospel and fostering community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_and_reward.htm">Accountability and Reward</a></b><br>There is a promise of eternal reward for those who use their resources in alignment with God's will, encouraging believers to live with accountability.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_wealth_to_make_friends.htm">How can we "make friends" using "worldly wealth" according to Luke 16:9?

You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>. The word was Syriac in its origin, and was found also, as Augustine testifies, in Punic. It was in common use in the Targums or Paraphrases of the Old Testament, in our Lord's time, for "wealth" or "riches," and possibly, as stated by Tertullian, whose authority, as a Carthaginian, may be admitted as of some weight, was applied to some Syrian deity who, like the Greek Plutus, was worshipped as wealth personified. If we admit this view, it explains, what otherwise it is not easy to explain, St. Luke's introduction of the Syriac word instead of its Greek equivalent. "The mammon of unrighteousness," the genitive having the same force as in <a href="/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>, is the wealth to which that character for the most part attaches, wealth wrongly gained and wrongly spent.

The right use of wealth in helping the poor, making men happier and better, leading them to repentance and to God, will gain for us friends, perhaps the very persons whom we have helped, perhaps the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner that repenteth, perhaps even Christ and the Father, who will receive us into "everlasting habitations." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness</span>. Then, with his usual solemn formula, "I say unto you," the Lord gave out his moral interpretation of the parable. His words were addressed to possessors of various degrees of wealth. "You will soon have to give up all your worldly goods; be prudent in time, make some real friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness; by means of that money entrusted to your care, do good to others who are in need." The <span class="accented">mammon of unrighteousness.</span> This word "mammon" does not denote, as some have supposed, the name of a deity, the god of wealth or money, but it signifies "money" itself. It is a Syriac or Aramaic term. The words, "of unrighteousness," are added because in so many cases <span class="accented">the getting</span> of money is tainted with unrighteousness in some form or other; and, when possessed, it so often hardens the heart, as the Lord himself said in another place (<a href="/luke/18-25.htm">Luke 18:25</a>), that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. "What the steward of my story," said the Master, "did to men of <span class="accented">his</span> world, see that you with your money do toward those who belong to your world." <span class="cmt_word">That, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations</span>. So that when you shall be dismissed from being stewards of God's possessions, that is, when ye shall die, "when ye suffer the last eclipse and bankruptcy of life," that then others, your friends, may receive you (welcome you) into everlasting dwellings. The majority of the older authorities here, instead of" when ye fail," read, "when it (money) shall fail you" (by the event of your death). The sense of the passage, however, remains the same, whichever reading be adopted. But now a deeply interesting question arises - When the Lord speaks <span class="accented">of friends</span> receiving us after death into eternal homes, to what <span class="accented">friends</span> is he alluding? Great expositors, Ewald and Meyer, for instance, tell us that he means <span class="accented">the angels.</span> But the plain sense of the parable points, not to angels, but to poor, weak, suffering persons whom we have helped here; these, then, must be the friends who will receive us, or welcome us, in the world to come. A further query suggests itself - <span class="accented">How</span> will these be able to receive us? To such a question no definite reply can be given. We know too little of the awful mysteries of <span class="accented">that</span> world to be able even to hazard a surmise as to the help or the comfort which grateful, blessed spirits will be able to show to their brethren the newly arrived, when they receive them. His word here must suffice us; well will it be for us, if one day we practically discover the holy secret for ourselves. Godet has a weighty note with which he concludes his exposition of this difficult but most instructive parable: "There is no thought more fitted than that of this parable, on the one hand to undermine the idea of merit belonging to alms-giving (what merit could be got out of that which is another's? and is not all money, are not all goods out of which we bestow our alms, God's?); and on the other, to encourage us in the practice of that virtue which assures us of friends and protectors for the grave moment of our passing into the world to come." One beautiful and exquisitely comforting thought is shrined in this playful and yet intensely solemn utterance of Jesus. The eternal tents, the "many mansions," as John calls them, will have among their occupants, it is certain, many a one whose life on earth was hard and sorrowful. These are now enjoying bliss indescribable, these poor Lazaruses, to whom this world was so sad, so dreary a habitation. And perhaps a portion of their blessedness consists in this power, to which the Lord makes allusion here, of assisting others - the <span class="accented">helped here becoming the helpers there.</span> Although the teaching of Christ and his chosen servants here and elsewhere shows us distinctly that no <span class="accented">merit</span> can attach to almsgiving, seeing that our alms are only given out of property entrusted to us for a short time by God for this and other similar purposes, yet the same authoritative teaching informs us that God <span class="accented">has</span> regard to almsdeeds done in the true spirit of love, in determining our eternal destiny. Thus a message direct from heaven informs the Roman legionary Cornelius that his prayers and alms were come up for a memorial before God. Paul writes to Timothy to charge the Ephesus Christians "that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life." In the parable of Lazarus and Dives we shall find this principle yet more clearly illustrated. These are only a few out of the many passages where this generosity and almsgiving is commended to the believer with peculiar earnestness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
