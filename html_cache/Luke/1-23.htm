According to <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, King David organized the priestly divisions, and each division served in the temple twice a year for a week at a time. Zechariah's service was part of this rotation. The completion of his service signifies the fulfillment of his priestly duties, which included offering incense and performing rituals. This context highlights the importance of faithfulness and duty in one's calling.<p><b>he returned home</b><br>Zechariah's home was in the hill country of Judea, as indicated later in <a href="/luke/1-39.htm">Luke 1:39</a>. This journey back home would have been significant, as it marked the transition from his public duties to his personal life. The return home also sets the stage for the fulfillment of the angel Gabriel's prophecy to Zechariah regarding the birth of John the Baptist. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God working through ordinary lives and settings to accomplish His divine purposes. The return home is a reminder of the intersection between divine promise and human experience, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the return of the prodigal son or the journeys of the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, serving in the temple when he received a message from the angel Gabriel about the birth of his son, John the Baptist.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place where Zechariah was performing his priestly duties when he encountered the angel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/home.htm">Home</a></b><br>The place Zechariah returned to after completing his temple service, where he would share the news of the angel's message with his wife, Elizabeth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_duty.htm">Faithfulness in Duty</a></b><br>Zechariah's completion of his temple service, despite his encounter with the angel, highlights the importance of faithfulness in our responsibilities.
