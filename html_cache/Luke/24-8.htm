In the context of <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, this occurs after the women discover the empty tomb and encounter angels. The timing is significant as it marks the transition from confusion to understanding, a common theme in the resurrection narratives.<p><b>they remembered</b><br>The act of remembering is crucial in biblical narratives, often associated with divine revelation or fulfillment of prophecy. In this context, it signifies the women's realization and understanding of Jesus' previous teachings about His death and resurrection. This moment of remembrance is a fulfillment of Jesus' predictions, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a> and <a href="/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31-33</a>, where He foretold His suffering, death, and resurrection.<p><b>His words</b><br>The words of Jesus are central to His ministry and the foundation of Christian faith. Here, "His words" refer to the predictions Jesus made about His death and resurrection. The emphasis on remembering His words highlights the importance of Jesus' teachings and prophecies. This moment connects to the broader biblical theme of the reliability and truth of God's word, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word accomplishing its purpose.
