The context is a parable Jesus tells to illustrate the Kingdom of God and the responsibility of His followers. The servant's coming forward signifies accountability and readiness to report to the master, symbolizing the believer's accountability to God. In biblical times, servants were expected to manage their master's resources wisely, reflecting the cultural expectation of stewardship.<p><b>&#8216;Master,</b><br>The term "Master" indicates a relationship of authority and submission. In the parable, the master represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His followers with resources and responsibilities. This reflects the biblical theme of Christ's lordship and the believer's role as a servant. The use of "Master" underscores the respect and recognition of authority that is due to Christ.<p><b>your mina</b><br>A mina was a unit of currency in the ancient world, equivalent to about three months' wages. The use of "your mina" emphasizes that the resources belong to the master, not the servant. This highlights the biblical principle that all we have is given by God and should be used for His purposes. The mina symbolizes the gifts, talents, and opportunities God entrusts to believers.<p><b>has produced ten more minas.&#8217;</b><br>The multiplication of the mina signifies fruitful stewardship and the effective use of what was entrusted. This reflects the biblical principle of bearing fruit and the expectation that believers will use their God-given resources to advance His kingdom. The tenfold increase is a testament to the servant's diligence and faithfulness, drawing a parallel to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>. This outcome also points to the eschatological reward for faithful service, as seen in the promise of rewards in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His servants with resources and responsibilities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who are entrusted with the Master's resources and are expected to be faithful stewards.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mina.htm">The Mina</a></b><br>A unit of currency in the parable, representing the gifts, talents, and opportunities given by God to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return_of_the_master.htm">The Return of the Master</a></b><br>Refers to the Second Coming of Christ, when He will evaluate the faithfulness of His servants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of the broader account in <a href="/bsb/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>, where Jesus is approaching His final week before the crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>Believers are called to be faithful with the resources God has entrusted to them, whether they be talents, time, or treasures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>There will be a time when we must give an account of how we have used what God has given us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_of_resources.htm">Multiplication of Resources</a></b><br>God expects us to use our gifts in a way that they multiply and bear fruit for His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Our actions and stewardship on earth have eternal implications and rewards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_engagement.htm">Active Engagement</a></b><br>We are encouraged to actively engage in the work of the kingdom, not to be passive or negligent with our responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_19_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 19:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_16_Faithful_stewardship.htm">How does Luke 19:16 illustrate faithful stewardship of God-given resources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_responsibility_in_Luke_19_16.htm">What can we learn about responsibility from the servant's actions in Luke 19:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_19_16_to_Matthew_25_parable.htm">How does Luke 19:16 connect to the Parable of the Talents in Matthew 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_servant_s_diligence_daily.htm">In what ways can we apply the servant's diligence to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_19_16_inspire_using_gifts.htm">How does Luke 19:16 encourage us to use our gifts for God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Servant_s_report_s_role_in_stewardship.htm">What is the significance of the servant's report in Luke 19:16 for Christian stewardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_16_Accountability_in_Christianity.htm">How does Luke 19:16 illustrate the concept of accountability in Christian teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Servant_s_gain_in_Luke_19_16_meaning.htm">What does the servant's gain in Luke 19:16 reveal about faithfulness and reward?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_avoid_idleness_biblically.htm">Can you be trusted with small and great things?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_steward_secure_his_future.htm">How does the unjust steward secure his future?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_luke_16_18_with_matt_19_9.htm">How can Luke 16:18's stark prohibition on divorce be reconciled with other scriptures (e.g., Matthew 19:9) that appear more nuanced on the issue?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'grace_upon_grace'_mean.htm">What does 'You Cannot Serve Two Masters' mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 19:16 Mean</div><b>The first servant</b><p>&#8226;

The verse calls believers to diligent, humble service, trusting that wholehearted stewardship will produce abundant fruit and receive the Master&#8217;s commendation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</span>--The increase is on a larger scale than in the parable in Matthew 25. There each of the faithful servants gains as much again as he had received. Here the gain is tenfold (1,000 per cent.). Adopting the view which has been taken of the distinctive ideas of the two parables, it may be said that what is suggested is the almost boundless opening for good acquired by the simple acceptance of the truth, apart from the opportunities offered by special gifts and functions. So interpreted, the several grades of increase correspond to the thirty, sixty, and hundredfold in the parable of the Sower. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/13-23.htm" title="But he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it; which also bears fruit, and brings forth, some an hundred times, some sixty, some thirty.">Matthew 13:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy pound</span>. At first the smallness of the sum given to each of the servants is striking. Was it not a sum unworthy of a noble about to receive a kingdom? The Attic pound was in value somewhat less than &pound;4 sterling. In the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where although very different lessons are inculcated, yet the imagery is somewhat similar, the amounts, however, are vastly larger, varying from five talents, which would represent about &pound;1000. Here the very smallness of the sum entrusted to the servants has its deep meaning. The "nobly born" one who is about to receive a kingdom, represents our Lord, who <span class="accented">here</span> is in a state of the deepest poverty and humiliation. The little sum In one sense represents the work he was able <span class="accented">then</span> to entrust to his own. Again, the paltriness of the sum given them seems to suggest what a future lay before them. No sharing in what they hoped for - the glories of a Messianic kingdom on earth. No rest in repose under the shadow of the mighty throne of King Messiah. The "very little" (ver. 17) told them - if they would only listen - that their future as his servants would be a life of comparatively obscure inglorious activity, without rank or power, landless, homeless, well-nigh friendless. But the sequel of the parable told more than this. It proclaimed that their Master was able to estimate the moral worth of those who had been faithful and true in a "very little;" ay, more, was in a position to reward the faithful servant. And the recompense, a city for a pound, just hints at the magnificent possibilities of the heaven-life, just suggests the splendour of its rewards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
