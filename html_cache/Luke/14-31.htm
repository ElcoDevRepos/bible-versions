In the ancient Near East, kings often engaged in territorial disputes, and warfare was a regular occurrence. The imagery of a king preparing for battle would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, who lived under Roman occupation and were aware of the political and military maneuvers of their time. This context emphasizes the seriousness and strategic planning required in leadership and decision-making.<p><b>will not first sit down and consider</b><br>The act of sitting down implies a deliberate and thoughtful process. In biblical times, leaders would gather their advisors and assess their resources and strategies before making significant decisions. This reflects the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which emphasizes the importance of planning and seeking counsel. It also aligns with Jesus' broader teaching on the necessity of thoughtful discipleship and the cost of following Him.<p><b>whether he can engage with ten thousand men</b><br>The mention of ten thousand men suggests a substantial but limited military force. In historical context, armies of varying sizes were common, and the number ten thousand would have been significant but not overwhelming. This detail highlights the need for realistic assessment of one's capabilities. It echoes the biblical principle of understanding one's limitations and relying on God's strength, as seen in stories like Gideon's reduction of his army in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</b><br>The opposing force of twenty thousand men represents a formidable challenge, doubling the king's own forces. This imbalance underscores the importance of strategic planning and the potential for overwhelming odds. It serves as a metaphor for the spiritual battles believers face, where reliance on God's power and wisdom is crucial. The imagery also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God delivering His people against seemingly insurmountable odds, as seen in the Exodus and David's victory over Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents a leader or decision-maker who must evaluate his resources and strategy before engaging in battle.

Discipleship is wholehearted, deliberate, and lifelong&#8212;anything less is folly in the face of the One whose kingdom cannot be shaken (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">What king, going to make war against another king . .?</span>--Here also there may have been a side-glance at contemporary history. The Tetrarch's divorce of his first wife had involved him in a war with her father Aretas, an Arabian king or ethnarch (see Note on <a href="/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>), in which his army was destroyed, and the Jewish historian sees in this the commencement of all his subsequent misfortunes (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. v.</span>, 18:5, ? 1).<p>In the spiritual interpretation of the two parables, the tower reminds us of the house in <a href="/context/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, and so stands for the structure of a holy life reared on the one Foundation; the warfare brings to our remembrance the conflict described in <a href="/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>. Here it stands partly for the conflict which every Christian carries on against sin, the world, and the devil, and of which we should take a clear estimate before we enter on it, partly for the greater war on which Christ Himself had entered, and of which He too had counted the cost-- that being, in His case, nothing less than the sacrifice of His own life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand! Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace</span>. It is not improbable that this simile was derived from the history of the time. The unhappy connection of the tetrarch Herod with Herodias had brought about the divorce of that sovereign's first wife, who was daughter of Aretas, a powerful Arabian prince. This involved Herod in an Arabian war, the result of which was disastrous to the tetrarch. Josephus points out that this ill-omened incident was the commencement of Herod Antipas's subsequent misfortunes. Our Lord not improbably used this simile, foreseeing what would be the ultimate end of this unhappy war of Herod. The. first of these two little similes rather points to the <span class="accented">building up</span> of the Christian life in the heart and life. The second is an image of the warfare which' every Christian man must wage against the world, its passions, and its lusts. If we cannot brace ourselves up to the' sacrifice necessary for the completion of the building up of the life we know the Master loves; if we shrink from the cost involved in the warfare against sin and evil - a warfare which will only end with life - better for us not to begin the building or risk the war. It will be a wretched alternative, but still it will be best for us to make our submission at once to the world and its prince; at least, by so doing we shall avoid the scandal and the shame of injuring a cause which we adopted only to forsake. The Swiss commentator Godet very naturally uses here a simile taken from his own nationality: "Would not a little nation like the Swiss bring down ridicule on itself by declaring war with France, if it were not determined to die nobly on the field of battle?" He was thinking of the splendid patriotism of his own brave ancestors who had determined so to die, and who carried out their gallant purpose. He was thinking of stricken fields like Morgarten and Sempach, and of brave hearts like those of Rudolph of Erlach, and Arnold of Winkelried, who loved their country better than their lives. This was the spirit with which Christ's warriors must undertake the hard stern warfare against an evil and corrupt world, otherwise better let his cause alone. The sombre shadow of the cross lay heavy and dark across all the Redeemer's words spoken at this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7978;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
