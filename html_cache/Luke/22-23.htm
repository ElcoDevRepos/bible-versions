The context is the Last Supper, a significant event where Jesus shares a final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion. The disciples' questioning reflects their uncertainty and fear, as they are unaware of who among them could betray Jesus. This moment highlights the human tendency to doubt and the lack of understanding of Jesus' mission, despite being close to Him. It also sets the stage for the unfolding of the betrayal, a pivotal event in the Passion narrative.<p><b>which of them was going to do this.</b><br>The "this" refers to the betrayal of Jesus, which He had just predicted. The disciples' questioning shows their lack of awareness of Judas Iscariot's intentions, emphasizing the subtlety of Judas's betrayal. This moment is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. The act of betrayal is a type of the ultimate rejection of Christ by humanity, yet it is also part of God's sovereign plan for redemption.

That all the disciples, on hearing this statement of their Master, should at once question their own hearts with the "Is it I?"

No suspicion on their parts ever seems to have fallen on Judas, their companion for so long a time. The direct colloquy of the Lord with the traitor, reported at length in the other Gospels on the occasion of dipping the sop into one of the Paschal dishes, was most probably carried on in a whisper (see <a href="/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26-29</a>, where mention is specially made of the disciples' ignorance of the dread meaning of their Master's words to Judas). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
