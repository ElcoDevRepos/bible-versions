Their response is strategic, as they are caught in a dilemma. If they acknowledge John's authority as divine, they must also accept Jesus' authority, which John endorsed. This reflects their unwillingness to accept the truth due to their hardened hearts, a theme seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>that they did not know</b><br>The leaders' claim of ignorance is disingenuous. They are not genuinely uncertain but are instead avoiding the implications of a truthful answer. This reflects a common human tendency to evade responsibility and truth when it is inconvenient. Their response is a form of self-preservation, highlighting their fear of losing power and influence among the people.<p><b>where it was from</b><br>The question of origin is central to the authority of both John the Baptist and Jesus. In Jewish culture, authority was often linked to lineage and divine calling. By refusing to acknowledge the divine origin of John's baptism, the leaders are also rejecting the divine authority of Jesus. This phrase underscores the theme of divine authority versus human authority, a recurring conflict in the Gospels. The leaders' inability to recognize or admit the source of true authority is a reflection of their spiritual blindness, which is contrasted with the faith and recognition of Jesus' authority by others, such as the centurion in <a href="/luke/7.htm">Luke 7:1-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts and is questioned by the religious leaders about His authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests,_scribes,_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests, Scribes, and Elders</a></b><br>These are the religious leaders who challenge Jesus, seeking to undermine His authority and trap Him in His words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, the temple is a significant place of worship and teaching for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is referenced in the preceding verses as Jesus asks about the origin of John's baptism.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present during this exchange, whose opinion the religious leaders fear, influencing their response to Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' authority is divine and not subject to human approval.

Their confession of &#8220;not knowing&#8221; is willful blindness (cf. <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>).<p>- Scripture warns that refusing clear light brings greater darkness (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). By denying knowledge, they harden themselves, fulfilling <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>&#8212;eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear.<p>- This self-protective stance contrasts sharply with the humility God desires (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Instead of repentance, they choose political maneuvering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where it was from</b><p>- The issue is authority. If John&#8217;s baptism is &#8220;from heaven,&#8221; then Jesus, whom John affirmed (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-34</a>), also carries divine authority (<a href="/luke/3-16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>).<p>- Admitting the source would obligate them to obey Jesus, yet rejecting it risks the people&#8217;s wrath because &#8220;all held John to be a prophet&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>).<p>- Their evasion exposes a heart unwilling to submit to God&#8217;s revealed will, just as Israel&#8217;s leaders repeatedly resisted the prophets (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51-52</a>).<p>- Jesus&#8217; question unmasks their hypocrisy; by refusing to state John&#8217;s origin, they forfeit any basis to challenge His authority (<a href="/luke/20-8.htm">Luke 20:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/20-7.htm">Luke 20:7</a> shows religious leaders sidestepping truth to preserve status. Their professed ignorance is deliberate, revealing fear of man, not fear of God. By denying what they know about John&#8217;s divine commission, they expose hearts unwilling to surrender to Jesus&#8217; authority. The verse warns us that evasion in the face of clear revelation leads to hardened unbelief, while honest confession opens the way to faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was</span>.
