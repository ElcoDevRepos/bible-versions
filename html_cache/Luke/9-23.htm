This setting emphasizes the universal nature of His message, applicable to all who would hear and consider following Him. The context is significant as it follows Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ and Jesus' prediction of His suffering, death, and resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-18.htm">Luke 9:18-22</a>).<p><b>&#8220;If anyone wants to come after Me,</b><br>The invitation is open to "anyone," highlighting the inclusive call of discipleship. "Come after Me" suggests a personal relationship and commitment to Jesus, implying a journey or path that one must choose to follow. This echoes the call of the first disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>) and sets the stage for the cost of discipleship.<p><b>he must deny himself</b><br>Denying oneself involves a radical reorientation of priorities, where personal desires and ambitions are subordinated to the will of Christ. This concept is counter-cultural, especially in a society that values self-fulfillment and autonomy. It reflects the biblical theme of self-sacrifice and humility, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>, where Christ's own humility and obedience are exemplified.<p><b>and take up his cross daily</b><br>The cross, a Roman instrument of execution, symbolizes suffering, shame, and death. For Jesus' audience, this imagery would be stark and shocking. Taking up one's cross "daily" suggests a continual, ongoing commitment to endure hardship and persecution for the sake of Christ. This phrase foreshadows Jesus' own crucifixion and aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> about being crucified with Christ.<p><b>and follow Me.</b><br>Following Jesus implies obedience and imitation of His life and teachings. It is an active, ongoing process that requires perseverance and faithfulness. This call to follow is consistent with Jesus' earlier invitations to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>) and is a central theme in the Gospels. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of following God, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs and prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowd, teaching them about the cost of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all who choose to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>A symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and ultimately, redemption.

His words carry authority; when He speaks, eternity-shaping choices confront every hearer (cf. <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone wants to come after Me</b><p>&#8220;

<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; It involves surrendering rights, ambitions, and sin-shaped desires (cf. <a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-2.htm">1 Peter 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226;

Suffering for Christ is not optional but integral to authentic faith (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And follow Me</b><p>&#8220;

Even though his great popularity was now on the wane, to the last he was evidently listened to by crowds, if not with enthusiasm, certainly with eager and impatient curiosity. The sermon, of which we have the outline in the next five verses, and the subject-matter of which was, "No cross, no crown," was preached evidently to the masses. This is plain from the opening words of ver. 23. The sermon was evidently a hard saying, and, no doubt, gave bitter offence to many of the hearers. "If any man <span class="accented">will</span>," that is, <span class="accented">wishes</span> to, "come after me, to follow me where I am going" (Jesus was going to his kingdom), "let that man be prepared to give up earthly ease and comfort, and be ready to bear the sufferings which will be sure to fall on him if he struggle after holiness." This readiness to give up ease, this willingness to bear suffering, will be a matter, they must remember, of everyday experience. The terrible simile with which the Lord pressed his stern lesson home was, of course, suggested to him by the clear view he had of the fearful end of his own earthly life - an end then so near at hand, though the disciples guessed it not. <span class="accented">The cross</span> was no unknown image to the Jews who that day listened to the Master. The gloomy procession of robbers and of rebels against Rome, each condemned one bearing to the place of death the cross on which he was to suffer, was a sadly familiar image then in their unhappy land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
