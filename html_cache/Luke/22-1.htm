It commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, during which they left in haste and did not have time to let their bread rise. This feast is a time of remembrance and celebration of God's deliverance and faithfulness. In the New Testament, leaven often symbolizes sin, and the removal of leaven from homes during this feast can be seen as a call to holiness and purity.<p><b>called the Passover</b><br>The Passover is a pivotal event in Jewish history, marking the night when God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites in Egypt that were marked with the blood of a lamb, sparing them from the plague of the firstborn. This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and is a profound type of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, whose blood brings salvation and deliverance from sin. The Passover meal, or Seder, includes specific elements that symbolize aspects of the Exodus story, and it is during this meal that Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper, connecting the Old Covenant with the New.<p><b>was approaching</b><br>The timing of the Passover is crucial in the Gospel narrative, as it sets the stage for the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. The approaching feast heightens the tension in the narrative, as Jesus' impending sacrifice is foreshadowed by the sacrificial lambs of Passover. This period is marked by increased activity in Jerusalem, with pilgrims arriving from all over to celebrate. The convergence of these events underscores the fulfillment of prophecy and God's sovereign plan for redemption through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A Jewish festival lasting seven days, during which no leavened bread is eaten.

Dr. Farrar suggests that the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span> is a transliteration, with a sort of alliterative allusion to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, "I suffer." This greatest and most important of the Jewish feasts, which ever brought a great host of pilgrims to Jerusalem, was kept in the first month of the Jewish year (Nisan), from the 15th of the month, the day of full moon, to the 21st.
