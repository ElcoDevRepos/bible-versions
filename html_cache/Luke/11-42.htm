The term "woe" is a strong expression of lament or denunciation, often used by prophets in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>). It signifies impending judgment or condemnation. The Pharisees were influential in Jewish society, and Jesus' rebuke highlights their spiritual blindness and hypocrisy.<p><b>For you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every herb,</b><br>The Pharisees were meticulous in their observance of tithing, even down to the smallest garden herbs like mint and rue. Tithing was a requirement under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>), but the Pharisees extended it to include even the minutiae, demonstrating their focus on external compliance. This practice reflects their emphasis on legalism and ritual purity, often at the expense of more significant moral and ethical obligations.<p><b>but you disregard justice and the love of God.</b><br>Here, Jesus contrasts the Pharisees' attention to minor legal details with their neglect of more critical aspects of the Law, such as justice and love. Justice is a central theme in the Old Testament, emphasized in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility. The love of God is foundational to the Law and the Prophets, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which Jesus cites as the greatest commandments (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The Pharisees' failure to prioritize these reflects a misunderstanding of God's character and the Law's intent.<p><b>You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.</b><br>Jesus acknowledges the importance of tithing, affirming that it should not be neglected. However, He emphasizes that it should not overshadow the weightier matters of justice and love. This statement aligns with the holistic approach to righteousness found throughout Scripture, where external observance is meant to reflect an internal transformation (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). Jesus calls for a balanced approach, where both the letter and the spirit of the Law are upheld, pointing to the comprehensive nature of true obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions. They are often depicted in the Gospels as being hypocritical and overly concerned with outward appearances rather than inner righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is addressing the Pharisees in this passage.

Here, again, we note minor variations--"rue and all manner of herbs," for St. Matthew's "anise and cummin;" "judgment and the love of God," for "the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith"--sufficient to show independence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But woe unto you, Pharisees: for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span> Probably the primitive Law of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, which directed that a tenth of every income in Israel should be given up to the service of the invisible King alone, referred to such important products as corn, and wine, and oil, and the like; but the present elaboration of the Law and the Pharisee schools had extended the primitive obligation to the smallest garden herbs, such as mint and rue. The Talmud even condescends to discuss whether, in tithing the seeds of these garden herbs, the very stalk too ought not to be tithed! The Master, ever tender and considerate, does not blame this exaggerated scrupulosity, if it were done to satisfy even a warped and distorted conscience; what he does find fault with, though, and in the bitterest terms language can formulate, is the substitution of and the clear preference for these infinitely lower duties for the higher. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
