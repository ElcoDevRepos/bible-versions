The term "hypocrites" is used to describe those who pretend to have virtues or beliefs that they do not actually possess. In the context of the Gospels, Jesus frequently uses this term to criticize the Pharisees for their outward show of piety while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). This rebuke highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who often prioritized legalistic interpretations over compassion and understanding.<p><b>the Lord replied.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority of Jesus as "the Lord," a title that signifies His divine authority and role as the Messiah. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' responses to challenges and questions often reveal His wisdom and understanding of the Scriptures. His reply here is not just a defense of His actions but a deeper teaching moment about the true purpose of the Sabbath and the nature of God's law.<p><b>&#8220;Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall</b><br>Here, Jesus points out the common practice among the Jews of His time to care for their animals even on the Sabbath. The Sabbath was a day of rest, as commanded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), but there were allowances for acts of necessity and mercy. The mention of untying an ox or donkey reflects the agrarian society of first-century Judea, where animals were essential for daily life and survival. This practice was accepted and understood, highlighting the inconsistency in the Pharisees' application of the law when it came to human need.<p><b>and lead it to water?</b><br>Leading an animal to water on the Sabbath was considered a necessary act of mercy, showing that the well-being of animals was important even on a day of rest. Jesus uses this example to argue that if such care is extended to animals, how much more should it be extended to humans, who are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). This rhetorical question underscores the principle that the Sabbath should be a day for doing good and meeting needs, aligning with Jesus' teaching that "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the hypocrisy of the religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue_leader.htm">Synagogue Leader</a></b><br>Represents the religious authority who criticized Jesus for healing on the Sabbath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, central to the conflict in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/ox_and_donkey.htm">Ox and Donkey</a></b><br>Animals used in Jesus' analogy to highlight the inconsistency in the leaders' application of the Sabbath law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>The context of this verse is Jesus healing a woman on the Sabbath, which sparked the criticism.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_sabbath_rest.htm">Understanding True Sabbath Rest</a></b><br>The Sabbath is meant for rest and worship, but also for doing good and showing mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confronting_hypocrisy.htm">Confronting Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Jesus calls out hypocrisy, urging us to examine our own lives for inconsistencies in our faith and practice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_compassion_over_legalism.htm">Prioritizing Compassion Over Legalism</a></b><br>The heart of God's law is love and compassion, which should guide our actions, even on the Sabbath.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_every_human_life.htm">The Value of Every Human Life</a></b><br>Jesus' healing on the Sabbath underscores the importance of valuing and caring for people above strict rule adherence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_tradition_and_love.htm">Balancing Tradition and Love</a></b><br>While traditions are important, they should not overshadow the command to love and serve others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_13_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 13:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_13_15_s_impact_on_Sabbath_today.htm">How does Luke 13:15 challenge our understanding of Sabbath observance today?

Genuine obedience flows from compassion: if we would untie an animal for water, we must gladly release people from bondage, for &#8220;it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) <span class= "bld">Doth not each one of you</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?--</span>The principle is the same as that in <a href="/matthew/12-11.htm" title="And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?">Matthew 12:11</a> (where see Note), but the case is put in even a stronger form. There the illustration is drawn from what might seem an exceptional act for an exceptional emergency; here from the regular practice of men, where their own interests were concerned. If they pleaded that it was not for their own interests, but those of humanity to the brutes committed to their charge, the answer was obvious that the daughter of Abraham was "better" than the ox or ass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</span> The older authorities here read "hypocrites," and thus join the cavilling synagogue ruler with the whole sect of men who taught an elaborate ritual in place of a high, pure life. The Lord, in a few master-touches, exposes the hollowness of such sabbath-keeping. Every possible indulgence was to be shown in cases where their own interests were involved; no mercy or indulgence was to be thought of, though, where the sick poor only were concerned. He vividly draws a contrast between the animal and the human being. The ox and the ass, though, were personal property; the afflicted daughter of Abraham was but a woman, friendless and poor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You hypocrites!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Hypokritai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5273.htm">Strong's 5273: </a> </span><span class="str2">From hupokrinomai; an actor under an assumed character, i.e. a dissembler</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
