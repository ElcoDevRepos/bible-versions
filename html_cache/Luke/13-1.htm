The timing is significant as it reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the authorities.<p><b>some of those present</b><br>This refers to individuals in the crowd who were following Jesus. The crowd often included a mix of disciples, curious onlookers, and religious leaders. Their presence highlights the public nature of Jesus' ministry and the diverse reactions to His teachings.<p><b>told Jesus about the Galileans</b><br>The mention of Galileans is significant as Galilee was a region known for its revolutionary zeal and resistance to Roman rule. Jesus Himself was from Galilee, which may have influenced the crowd's decision to bring this incident to His attention. The Galileans were often viewed with suspicion by the Judean authorities.<p><b>whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices</b><br>Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea, known for his harsh and sometimes brutal governance. The act of mixing blood with sacrifices suggests a violent suppression of a perceived rebellion or disturbance. This incident reflects the political and religious tensions of the time, as the Temple was a sacred place for the Jews, and any defilement would have been deeply offensive. This event is not recorded elsewhere in Scripture, but it underscores the oppressive Roman occupation and the volatility of the period.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and responding to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galileans.htm">Galileans</a></b><br>People from the region of Galilee, known for their distinct cultural and religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, known for his role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>Religious offerings made by the Jews, typically involving the shedding of animal blood as an act of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_who_reported_to_jesus.htm">People who reported to Jesus</a></b><br>Unnamed individuals who brought the news to Jesus, possibly seeking His opinion or judgment on the matter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_injustice.htm">Understanding Injustice</a></b><br>This passage highlights the reality of injustice and suffering in the world.

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-2.htm" title="And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.">Matthew 27:2</a>.) We may fairly infer it to have originated in some outburst of zealous fanaticism, such as still characterised the followers of Judas of Galilee (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>), while the pilgrims from that province were offering their sacrifices in the courts of the Temple, and to have been repressed with the same ruthless severity as he had shown in other tumults. It was probably one, at least, of the causes of the enmity between Herod and Pilate of which we read in <a href="/luke/23-12.htm" title="And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.">Luke 23:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - <span class="accented">Signs of the times.

Some of those then present, probably Jerusalem Jews, specially told off to watch the great Teacher, struck with his grave foreboding tone, when he spoke of the present aspect of affairs, quoted to him a recent bloody fray which had taken place in the temple courts. "Yes, Master," these seemed to say, "we see there is a fierce hatred which is ever growing more intense between Jew and Roman. You know, for instance, what has just taken place in the city, only the victims in this case were Galilaeans, not scrupulous, righteous Jews. Is it not possible that these bloody deeds are simply punishments of men who are great sinners, as <span class="accented">these</span> doubtless were?" Such-like incidents were often now occurring under the Roman rule. This, likely enough, had taken place at some crowded Passover gathering, when a detachment of soldiers came down from the Castle of Antonia and had dealt a red-handed "justice" among the turbulent mob. Josephus relates several of the more formidable of such collisions between the Romans and the Jews. At one Passover he relates how three thousand Jews were butchered, and the temple courts were filled with dead corpses; at another of these feasts two thousand perished in like manner (see ' Ant.,' 17:9. 3; 20:5.3; and ' Bell. Jud.,' 2:5; 5:1). On another occasion disguised legionaries were sent by Pilate the governor with daggers among the Passover crowds (see 'Ant.,' 18:31). These wild and terrible collisions were of frequent occurrence in these sad days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
