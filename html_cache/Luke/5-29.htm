Tax collectors were often despised by the Jewish people because they worked for the Roman authorities and were seen as traitors and sinners. Hosting a banquet signifies Levi's transformation and gratitude for his new life in Christ. Banquets in the ancient Near East were significant social events, often used to honor guests and establish social bonds. This act of hosting Jesus indicates Levi's acceptance of Jesus' authority and his desire to introduce others to Him. The setting in Levi's house suggests a personal and intimate gathering, reflecting the early Christian practice of meeting in homes for fellowship and worship.<p><b>A large crowd of tax collectors was there,</b><br>The presence of many tax collectors highlights the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry. Tax collectors were marginalized and often ostracized by Jewish society, yet Jesus' willingness to associate with them demonstrates His mission to seek and save the lost, regardless of their social status. This gathering of tax collectors can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Gospel's reach beyond traditional Jewish boundaries, emphasizing the theme of grace and redemption available to all. The large crowd also suggests Levi's influence among his peers and his eagerness to share his newfound faith.<p><b>along with others who were eating with them.</b><br>The mention of "others" indicates that the gathering was not exclusive to tax collectors, but included a diverse group of people. This reflects the early Christian community's diversity and the breaking down of social barriers through Christ. Eating together in the ancient world was a sign of acceptance and fellowship, and Jesus' participation in such meals underscores His message of reconciliation and unity. This scene parallels other instances in the Gospels where Jesus dines with sinners and outcasts, reinforcing His role as the Savior for all humanity. The act of eating together also prefigures the eschatological banquet in the Kingdom of God, where people from all walks of life will be united in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi (Matthew)</a></b><br>Levi, also known as Matthew, was a tax collector who became one of Jesus' disciples.

The name Matthew, "gift of God," was probably given to him, as that of Peter (or Cephas, "a rock") was bestowed on Simon, after his association with Jesus. The words used, "a great feast," a great company, plainly indicate that Levi (Matthew)was a person of consideration and position. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them</span>. The great company was owing to the fact that the publicans and their friends, moved by the kindness and friendship of the new Teacher, assembled at the feast in numbers out of respect to him; or, more likely, the assemblage was owing to the effort of Levi (Matthew) to bring into friendly relations his associates and friends and the new Master, for whose sake he had given up everything. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Levi</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#949;&#965;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Leuis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3018.htm">Strong's 3018: </a> </span><span class="str2">(Hebrew), Levi, son of Alphaeus, the publican.
