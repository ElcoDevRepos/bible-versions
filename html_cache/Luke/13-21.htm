In this context, it represents the transformative power of the Kingdom of God. Leaven's ability to permeate and change the dough parallels how the Kingdom can transform individuals and societies. In other biblical passages, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, leaven symbolizes sin and corruption, but here it highlights growth and expansion.<p><b>that a woman took</b><br>The mention of a woman is significant, as women were often responsible for baking in ancient Jewish culture. This detail emphasizes the everyday nature of the Kingdom's work, occurring in ordinary settings and through ordinary people. It also reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, which often elevated the roles of women.<p><b>and mixed into three measures of flour</b><br>Three measures of flour is a substantial amount, approximately 50 pounds, indicating the abundance and sufficiency of God's Kingdom. This quantity would have been enough to feed a large group, symbolizing the Kingdom's capacity to nourish and sustain many. The use of three measures may also have symbolic significance, as the number three often represents completeness or divine perfection in Scripture.<p><b>until all of it was leavened</b><br>The leaven's complete permeation of the flour illustrates the pervasive and inevitable spread of the Kingdom of God. This transformation is gradual but certain, reflecting the nature of spiritual growth and the ultimate fulfillment of God's purposes. This concept is echoed in other parables, such as the mustard seed (<a href="/luke/13-18.htm">Luke 13:18-19</a>), which also emphasizes the Kingdom's expansive growth from small beginnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, using everyday imagery to convey spiritual truths about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Represents an ordinary person engaging in a common task, symbolizing the transformative power of the Kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/yeast.htm">Yeast (Leaven)</a></b><br>A small agent that causes significant change, symbolizing the pervasive and transformative nature of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_measures_of_flour.htm">Three Measures of Flour</a></b><br>A large quantity of flour, indicating the extensive influence of the Kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teaching, depicted as a growing and transformative force.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformative_power_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Transformative Power of the Kingdom</a></b><br>Just as yeast transforms dough, the Kingdom of God transforms lives and societies from within.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_subtle_and_pervasive_nature_of_god's_work.htm">The Subtle and Pervasive Nature of God's Work</a></b><br>The Kingdom often works quietly and unseen, yet its impact is profound and far-reaching.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_individuals_in_god's_kingdom.htm">The Role of Individuals in God's Kingdom</a></b><br>Like the woman in the parable, believers are called to be agents of transformation in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_small_beginnings.htm">The Importance of Small Beginnings</a></b><br>Small acts of faith and obedience can lead to significant spiritual growth and influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holistic_influence_of_the_gospel.htm">The Holistic Influence of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel permeates every aspect of life, bringing about comprehensive change.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_13_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 13:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_13_21_God_s_kingdom_transforms_us.htm">How does Luke 13:21 illustrate the transformative power of God's kingdom in us?

The <span class="accented">first</span> of these two little parables of the kingdom, "the mustard seed," portrayed its strangely rapid growth. The <span class="accented">second</span>, "the leaven," treats of the mighty inward transformation which the kingdom of God will effect in the hearts of men and women. Chemically speaking, leaven is a lump of sour dough in which putrefaction has begun, and, on being introduced into a far greater mass of fresh dough, produces by contagion a similar condition into the greater bulk with which it comes in contact. The result of the contact, however, is that the mass of dough, acted upon by the little lump of leaven, becomes a wholesome, agreeable food for men. It was a singularly striking and powerful simile, this little commonplace comparison, and exactly imaged the future progress of "the kingdom." Quietly, silently, the doctrine of the Master made its way into the hearts and homes of men. "He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets" (<a href="/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a>). None on earth would have dared hint at the future success of the doctrine of the Master during the Master's life, and his death seemed as though it would effectually crush out the last feeble spark of life. The apparent result of his work was the devotion of a few simple hearts, mostly of fishermen, artisans, and the like, and yet, though men suspected it not, the secret and powerful influence was already at work among men. The story of the years succeeding the cross and the Resurrection, on a broader stage and with more actors, was a story of similar silent, quiet working. In a century and a half after the strange leaven-parable had been spoken, the whole civilized world knew something of the Master's history and doctrine. His disciples then were counted by tens of thousands. No city, scarcely a village, but contained some into whose hearts the teaching had sunk, whose lives the teaching had changed. <span class="accented">In three measures of meal.</span> Perhaps referring here to the well-known division of man into body, soul, and spirit. More likely, however, the number 3 is used as the symbol of completeness, signifying that the Divine purpose was then influencing the whole mass of mankind. <span class="accented">Till the whole was leavened.</span> It would seem as though the Master looked on to a definite time when all nations should come and worship him, and acknowledge his glorious sovereignty. If this be the case, then a very long period still remains to be lived through by the world; many kingdoms must rise and fall, new civilizations spring up, before that day of joy and gladness dawns upon the globe - that is, reasoning on the analogy of the past. Be this, however, as it may, the drift of both these parables of the kingdom distinctly points to a slow yet a progressive development of true religion. Very different, indeed, was the Jewish conception of Messiah's kingdom. They expected a rapid and brilliant metamorphosis of the then unhappy state of things. They never dreamed of the slow and quiet movement Messiah's coming was to inaugurate. One thing is perfectly clear - the Speaker of these two parable-stories never contemplated a speedy return to earth. With strange exactness the last eighteen hundred and fifty years have been fulfilling the conditions of the two similes, and as yet, as far as man can see, they are not nearly complete. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
