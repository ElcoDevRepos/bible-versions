Their return signifies the completion of their mission, highlighting the importance of accountability and discipleship. This moment reflects the practice of reporting back to a leader, a common cultural practice in Jewish rabbinic traditions. It also emphasizes the role of Jesus as a teacher and leader who is deeply involved in the ministry of His followers. The apostles' actions can be seen as a precursor to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus sends His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>Taking them away privately,</b><br>Jesus often sought solitude for prayer and reflection, as seen in <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>. This withdrawal indicates the need for rest and debriefing after ministry work, a principle that underscores the balance between work and rest in Christian life. The private setting suggests an intimate time for teaching and reflection, away from the crowds. This practice of retreating is mirrored in the Old Testament, where prophets like Elijah sought solitude to hear from God (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>).<p><b>He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida.</b><br>Bethsaida, meaning "house of fishing," was a small fishing village on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It is significant as the hometown of several apostles, including Peter, Andrew, and Philip (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>). Archaeological findings suggest it was a place of modest living, fitting for Jesus' humble ministry. The choice of Bethsaida for retreat may also symbolize a return to familiar and supportive environments. This location is also linked to several miracles, such as the healing of a blind man (<a href="/mark/8-22.htm">Mark 8:22-26</a>), demonstrating Jesus' power and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The twelve disciples chosen by Jesus, who were sent out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida</span>. This, perhaps the most famous and oftenest told of the Lord's miracles, was worked directly after the return of the twelve from their mission. He and they were no doubt very weary of the crowds which continually now thronged them. The excitement of the multitude about Jesus was now at its height. Directly after the discourse at Capernaum (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.), which immediately followed the great miracle we are about to discuss, the popular enthusiasm began to wane. Intensely weary, dispirited too at the story of the murder of John the Baptist, which was told the Master by the disciples and the friends of John on their return from their mission, Jesus determined for a brief space to withdraw himself from the public gaze. He crossed the Lake of Gennesaret in one of his friends' fishing-boats to a town lately identified by modern research as Bethsaida Julias, a small city recently beautified by Herod Philip, and named Bethsaida Julias, after the daughter of Augustus. Bethsaida, "house of fish," was a name attached evidently to several of these fishing centres on the shores of the lake. Many of the multitude of whom we read subsequently in the account of the miracle, had watched his departure in the boat for the neighbourhood of Bethsaida Julias, and had gone on foot round the head of the lake to join the popular Teacher again. The distance round the north end of the lake from the point of embarkation, most likely Capernaum, to Bethsaida Julias is not very considerable. The crowd which soon joined him in retirement would be considerably swelled by many of the Passover pilgrims just arrived at Capernaum on their way to Jerusalem to keep the feast. These would be anxious, too, to see and to hear the great Galilaean Prophet, whose name just then was in every mouth. Not very far from Bethsaida Julias there is a secluded plain, <span class="accented">El Batihah</span>; thither Jesus no doubt went after leaving his fishing-boat, purposing to spend some time in perfect rest. Soon, however, the usually quiet plain becomes populous with the crowds following after the Galilaean Master. Though longing intensely for repose so necessary for himself and his disciples, he at once, moved by the eagerness of the multitude to hear and see him again, gives them his usual loving welcome, and begins in his old fashion to teach them many things, and to heal their sick. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
