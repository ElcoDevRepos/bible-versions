In the biblical context, "fruit" often symbolizes the visible evidence of one's inner spiritual state (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). The call to produce fruit aligns with the teachings of the prophets, who urged Israel to demonstrate their faith through righteous living (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>). The concept of repentance is central to the message of John the Baptist, who prepared the way for Jesus by calling people to turn from their sins (<a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-2</a>).<p><b>And do not begin to say to yourselves, &#8216;We have Abraham as our father.&#8217;</b><br>This warning addresses the complacency and false security that some Jews of the time felt due to their lineage. Many believed that being descendants of Abraham guaranteed them favor with God (<a href="/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33-39</a>). However, John the Baptist challenges this notion, emphasizing that true relationship with God is not based on heritage but on faith and obedience. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God values a contrite heart over mere ritual or ancestry (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p><b>For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</b><br>This statement underscores God's sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises in unexpected ways. The imagery of stones may allude to the barren wilderness where John preached, symbolizing lifelessness and the miraculous power of God to bring forth life (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). It also foreshadows the inclusion of the Gentiles into the family of God, as Paul later explains that true children of Abraham are those who share his faith (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7-9</a>).

Genuine turning to God always reshapes how we speak, spend, forgive, serve, and love.<p>&#8211; The apostle Paul preached &#8220;that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds worthy of their repentance&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>).<p>&#8211; James underlines it: &#8220;Faith by itself, if it does not result in action, is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>Practical evidence of repentance includes:<p>&#8226; broken relationships mended (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>)<p>&#8226; generosity replacing greed (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>)<p>&#8226; moral purity over secret sin (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-4</a>)<p>&#8226; the Spirit&#8217;s fruit&#8212;love, joy, peace, and the rest (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-25</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not begin to say to yourselves, &#8216;We have Abraham as our father.&#8217;</b><p>&#8211; The crowd assumed physical descent from Abraham guaranteed God&#8217;s favor.

He can certainly turn physical stones&#8212;or hardened human hearts&#8212;into living members of His family.<p>&#8211; Peter later calls believers &#8220;living stones&#8230;built into a spiritual house&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), echoing the very image John used on the Jordan&#8217;s banks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a> insists that true repentance is visible, that ancestry gives no automatic pass with God, and that He is fully able to raise a faithful people from the most unpromising raw material. Real repentance bears fruit, real faith rests in Christ rather than heritage, and the God who can make children from stones still transforms hearts today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance</span>. In other words, "Since you profess to have taken flight from the wrath to come, show at once, by your change of life, that your repentance is worth something, has some meaning in it." <span class="cmt_word">Begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father.</span> These words show that John had the splendid courage to strike boldly at the very root of Jewish pride. Gradually Jewish belief in the especial favor of God, which they were to enjoy through all eternity, had grown up till it resulted in such extravagant expressions as these: "Abraham would sit at the gates of hell, and would not permit any circumcised Israelite of decent moral character to enter it;" "A single Israelite is worth more in God's sight than all the nations of the world;" "The world was made for their (Israel's) sake." This incredible arrogancy grew as their earthly fortunes became darker and darker. Only an eternity of bliss, of which they alone were to be partakers, could make up for the woes they were made to suffer here, while an eternity of anguish for the Gentile world outside Israel was a necessary vengeance for the indignities this Gentile world had inflicted upon the chosen people. Long ago the great Hebrew prophets had warned the deluded race that their election would profit them nothing if they failed in their duties to their God and their neighbor. <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham</span>; pointing, no doubt, to the rough shingle lying on the river Jordan's banks. John's thought was the same which Paul afterwards expressed to the Galatians in his own nervous language, "Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham;" "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7, 29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
