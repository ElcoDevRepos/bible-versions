This setting is crucial as it highlights the importance of His teachings to both His immediate followers and the broader audience. The context is a public teaching moment, emphasizing the universal relevance of His message.<p><b>&#8220;Watch out!</b><br>This phrase is a warning, indicating the seriousness of the issue at hand. In the original Greek, the term used conveys a sense of vigilance and alertness. Jesus often used such warnings to draw attention to spiritual dangers, similar to His warnings about false prophets and teachings elsewhere in the Gospels.<p><b>Guard yourselves against every form of greed,</b><br>Greed, or covetousness, is a recurring theme in Scripture, often linked to idolatry and a departure from reliance on God. The phrase "every form" suggests that greed can manifest in various ways, not just through the accumulation of wealth. This aligns with the Ten Commandments, where coveting is explicitly prohibited, and echoes teachings in Proverbs about the dangers of desiring wealth.<p><b>for one&#8217;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.&#8221;</b><br>This statement challenges the cultural and historical context of the time, where wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor. Jesus redefines the concept of life, emphasizing spiritual richness over material wealth. This teaching is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. It also reflects the prophetic tradition of valuing justice and righteousness over material prosperity, as seen in the writings of the prophets like Amos and Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, delivering a teaching to His disciples and the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are present and receiving His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A larger group of people gathered around Jesus, listening to His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_fool.htm">The Rich Fool (Contextual Reference)</a></b><br>In the parable that follows, Jesus illustrates His point with the account of a rich man who hoards wealth but is not "rich toward God."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_greed.htm">Guard Against Greed</a></b><br>Jesus warns us to be vigilant against all forms of greed.

Our Lord's words show that He had read the secret of the man's heart. Greed was there, with all its subtle temptations, leading the man to think that "life" was not worth living unless he had a superfluity of goods. The general truth is illustrated by a parable, obviously selected by St. Luke, as specially enforcing the truth which he held to be of primary importance. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</span> The older authorities read, "beware of every kind of covetousness." No vice is more terribly illustrated in the Old Testament story than this. Prominent illustrations of ruin overtaking the covetous man, even in this life, are Balaam, Achan, and Gehazi. Has not this ever been one of the besetting sins of the chosen race, <span class="accented">then as now</span>, <span class="accented">now as then</span>? Jesus, as the Reader of hearts, saw what was at the bottom of the question: greed, rather than a fiery indignation at a wrong endured. "A man's life." <span class="accented">His true life</span>, would be a fair paraphrase of the Greek word used here. The Master's <span class="accented">own</span> life, landless, homeless, penniless, illustrated nobly these words. <span class="accented">That</span> life, as far as earth was concerned, was his deliberate choice. The world, Christian as well as pagan, in each succeeding age, with a remarkable agreement, utterly declines to recognize the great Teacher's view of life here. To make his meaning perfectly clear, the Lord told them the following parable-story, which reads like an experience or memory of something which had actually happened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
