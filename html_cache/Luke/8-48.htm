This is significant in the cultural context where women often had a lower social status. By calling her "Daughter," Jesus affirms her worth and dignity. This term also reflects the compassionate nature of Jesus, who often reached out to those marginalized by society.<p><b>said Jesus,</b><br>The authority of Jesus is emphasized here. In the Gospels, Jesus often speaks with authority, whether calming storms, casting out demons, or healing the sick. His words carry power and are a direct expression of His divine nature. This moment is a personal interaction, highlighting Jesus' willingness to engage with individuals personally and intimately.<p><b>&#8220;your faith has healed you.</b><br>The phrase underscores the importance of faith in the healing process. It is not merely the physical touch of Jesus' garment that healed the woman, but her faith in His power to heal. This reflects a broader biblical theme where faith is a conduit for divine action (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). The healing is both physical and spiritual, indicating a restoration to wholeness. This connects to other instances in the Gospels where faith is pivotal, such as the healing of the centurion's servant (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>).<p><b>Go in peace.&#8221;</b><br>"Go in peace" is a common biblical benediction, signifying not just the absence of conflict but a holistic sense of well-being and reconciliation with God. In the Jewish context, peace (shalom) encompasses health, prosperity, and spiritual harmony. Jesus' command to "go in peace" indicates that the woman is not only healed but also restored to a state of spiritual peace. This peace is a foretaste of the ultimate peace believers will experience in the Kingdom of God (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who speaks to the woman, acknowledging her faith and granting her peace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>She had been suffering for twelve years and was healed by touching the hem of Jesus' garment, demonstrating her faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people surrounded Jesus, making it difficult for the woman to reach Him, yet she persevered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus.htm">Jairus</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Jairus is a synagogue leader whose account is intertwined with the woman's healing, as Jesus was on His way to heal Jairus' daughter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hem_of_jesus'_garment.htm">The Hem of Jesus' Garment</a></b><br>Represents the point of contact for the woman's faith, symbolizing her belief in Jesus' power to heal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_a_catalyst_for_healing.htm">Faith as a Catalyst for Healing</a></b><br>The woman's faith was the key to her healing.

This is the only place in the Gospels where our Lord is reported to have used this loving word to any woman. Eusebius preserves a curious legend in connection with this act of healing. In his time (fourth century) the house of this happy one who met Jesus in her sad life-journey, was shown at Paneas, a town in the north of Palestine. At the entrance of the house, on a stone pedestal, stood two brazen statues - one represented a woman kneeling; the other, a man with his cloak over his shoulder and his hand stretched out toward the kneeling woman. Eusebius relates how he had seen the house and statues and heard the legend ('Hist. Eccl.,' 7:18). In the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, a very early writing, though not one possessing much critical value, the name of the woman is stated to be Veronica. It was she, goes on the story to re]ate, who, on the Via Dolorosa, when the Lord, on his way to Calvary, stumbled and fell, gave the handkerchief to wipe the blessed face. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Daughter,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#965;&#947;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(Thygat&#275;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2364.htm">Strong's 2364: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently a primary word; a female child, or descendant.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said [Jesus],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
