This reflects the fulfillment of messianic expectations and prophecies, particularly those found in Isaiah. Jesus emphasizes the importance of eyewitness testimony, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels, underscoring the reliability of the accounts of His works and teachings.<p><b>The blind receive sight,</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' miraculous power and fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which prophesies that the eyes of the blind will be opened. Healing the blind was a sign of the Messiah's arrival, demonstrating divine authority and compassion. In the cultural context, blindness was often seen as a curse or punishment, and Jesus' healing acts as a reversal of such societal stigmas.<p><b>the lame walk,</b><br>The healing of the lame is another messianic sign, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. This miracle not only demonstrates Jesus' power over physical ailments but also symbolizes spiritual restoration and the coming of God's kingdom. In the historical context, the lame were marginalized, and Jesus' actions show His concern for the outcast and His role as a restorer.<p><b>the lepers are cleansed,</b><br>Leprosy was a highly stigmatized disease, rendering individuals ceremonially unclean and socially isolated. Jesus' cleansing of lepers fulfills the messianic prophecy of healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). It also signifies His authority over both physical and spiritual impurity, as He reintegrates the marginalized into the community.<p><b>the deaf hear,</b><br>This miracle fulfills <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>, where the deaf will hear the words of a book. It signifies the opening of spiritual understanding and the breaking of barriers to receiving God's word. In the cultural context, the deaf were often excluded from religious life, and Jesus' healing represents the inclusivity of His ministry.<p><b>the dead are raised,</b><br>Raising the dead is a profound demonstration of Jesus' divine power and authority over life and death, prefiguring His own resurrection. This act fulfills prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, which speak of the dead living again. It serves as a powerful testament to Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the bringer of eternal life.<p><b>and the good news is preached to the poor.</b><br>Preaching the good news to the poor fulfills <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the anointed one brings good tidings to the afflicted. This phrase underscores Jesus' mission to reach the marginalized and oppressed, offering hope and salvation. It highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel, breaking down social and economic barriers, and emphasizing the kingdom of God is accessible to all, regardless of status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing miracles and fulfilling Messianic prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The forerunner of Christ, who is in prison and sends his disciples to inquire about Jesus' identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_of_john.htm">Disciples of John</a></b><br>Messengers sent by John to ask Jesus if He is the expected Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracles.htm">The Miracles</a></b><br>Specific acts of healing and resurrection that Jesus performs, demonstrating His divine authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Recipients of the good news, highlighting Jesus' mission to reach the marginalized and oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' actions confirm His identity as the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.

These miracles which the messengers witnessed that day, striking though they were, were no novel ones in the work of our Lord. They were, too, precisely similar to those which had already been reported to him in his prison (ver. 18). But Jesus, pointing to these signs, bade the friends of the Baptist return and tell <span class="accented">their</span> master what they had seen in <span class="accented">these</span> words. The great Messianic prophet, whose writings were so well known to John, had said that Messiah's advent would be heralded by these very acts. John would in a moment catch the meaning of the reply. The passages in question are <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a> and Isaiah 35:4, 6. Wordsworth, on these works wrought by the great Physician, very beautifully writes, "One of the most consolatory reflections produced by these mighty and merciful works of Christ on earth is the assurance they give that at the great day of resurrection he will remove all infirmities and blemishes from the bodies of his servants, and clothe them in immortal health, beauty, and glory, so as to be like his own glorious body, once marred on the cross, but raised by himself from the dead, and now reigning for ever in glory" (Bishop Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">To the</span> <span class="cmt_word">poor the gospel is preached.</span> John would be able to draw his inference, too, from this feature in Jesus' work. His messengers would have heard the Teacher's words, and would have marked from what class especially his hearers were drawn. It was a new experience in the world's story, this tender care for the poor. No heathen teacher of Rome or Athens, of Alexandria or the far East, had ever cared to make this vast class of unprofitable hearers the objects of their teaching. The rabbis of Israel cared nothing for them. In the Talmud we often find them spoken of with contempt. But John knew that this speaking to and consorting with the poor would be one of the marked characteristics of Messiah when he came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Go [back]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Poreuthentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4198.htm">Strong's 4198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To travel, journey, go, die. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] report</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(apangeilate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">To report (from one place to another), bring a report, announce, declare.
