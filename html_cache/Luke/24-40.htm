The context is crucial as it occurs after His crucifixion and resurrection, a pivotal moment in Christian theology. Jesus had just reassured His disciples, who were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a spirit. His words are meant to calm and affirm His physical resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.<p><b>He showed them His hands and feet</b><br>By showing His hands and feet, Jesus provides tangible proof of His bodily resurrection. The marks from the crucifixion nails serve as evidence that He is the same Jesus who was crucified. This act fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was "pierced for our transgressions." It also connects to <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, which speaks of hands and feet being pierced. The physical demonstration counters any notion that Jesus was merely a spirit, affirming the doctrine of the bodily resurrection.

This moment anchors Christian confidence: the risen Savior is real, His atonement complete, and His commission trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - Some (but not the majority) of the older authorities omit this verse. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet</span>. It has been suggested that the Risen simply pointed to those parts of his body which were not covered with clothing, and invited the disciples to touch these, and so to assure themselves that he had actually flesh and bone. Von Gerlach has an interesting suggestion that the feet were especially referred to "because there was in the feet something more convincing and touching than even in the hands, on account of the wonder that One who had been so grievously wounded could move." The real reason, however, of the Lord calling attention to <span class="accented">the hands and feet</span> comes out from St. John's account of this appearance of the Risen, for he adds that Jesus also showed them <span class="accented">his side.</span> Thus he pointed to the <span class="accented">wounded members</span> of his blessed body to show that in the resurrection-body he retained these marks of his wounds. That he retained them now and for ever we ]mow from the glorious vision of the Revelation, where the wounded humanity of the Lord appears throned and adored in the highest heaven: "Lo, <span class="accented">in</span> the midst of the throne and of the four beasts [living creatures], and in the midst of the elders, <span class="accented">stood a Lamb as it had been slain"</span> (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>). Our Master and God retains these as the glorious tokens of his victory and atonement. Augustine very strikingly deduces from this that perhaps we shall see the same with respect to the wounds of the martyrs ('De Civ. Dei,' lib. 22. cap. 19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And [when]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
