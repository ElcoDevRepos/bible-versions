In the biblical context, ailments were often seen as having spiritual origins, reflecting the belief in the interconnectedness of physical and spiritual realms. The mention of "eighteen years" emphasizes the chronic nature of her condition, highlighting her long-term suffering and the severity of her affliction. The number eighteen, while not having a specific symbolic meaning in Scripture, underscores the prolonged period of her distress. This account is unique to the Gospel of Luke, known for its focus on Jesus' compassion and healing ministry. The reference to a "spirit" suggests a demonic influence, which was a common understanding of unexplained illnesses in the first-century Jewish context. This aligns with other biblical accounts where Jesus confronts and overcomes demonic forces, demonstrating His authority over both physical and spiritual realms (e.g., <a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a>).<p><b>She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.</b><br>The description of the woman's physical condition as "hunched over" paints a vivid picture of her suffering and limitations. This condition, likely a form of severe spinal deformity, would have significantly impacted her daily life, making even basic tasks difficult. In the cultural context of the time, physical deformities were often stigmatized, and those afflicted might have been marginalized or viewed as cursed. The inability to "stand up straight" symbolizes not only her physical bondage but also her social and spiritual oppression. This imagery of being bent over contrasts with the uprightness associated with spiritual freedom and dignity. The healing that Jesus provides is not just a physical restoration but also a liberation from the spiritual bondage that has held her captive. This act of healing prefigures the ultimate redemption and restoration that Jesus offers to all who are oppressed by sin and suffering, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of proclaiming freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is teaching in a synagogue on the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>A woman afflicted by a disabling spirit for eighteen years, unable to stand upright.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The place of worship and teaching where this event occurs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Described as the cause of the woman's physical ailment, indicating a spiritual dimension to her suffering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>The day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, significant in the context of Jesus' healing work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">The Reality of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The woman's condition is attributed to a spirit, reminding us of the spiritual dimension of our struggles.

The description of the sufferer, so accurate in its details, marks the medical training of the compiler here. The malady was evidently a curvature of the spine of a very grave character. Her presence in the synagogue that day gives us a hint, at least, that this poor afflicted one loved communion with her God. Doubtless the faith and trust on her side necessary to the cure were there. Her first act, after she was sensible of the blessed change wrought in her poor diseased frame, was an outpouring of devout thanks to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a woman</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(gyn&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
