Their love of money is highlighted here, indicating a potential hypocrisy in their spiritual leadership. This love of money contrasts with the teachings of the Law, which emphasize justice, mercy, and faithfulness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The Pharisees' materialism is also condemned in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, where Jesus criticizes their neglect of the weightier matters of the law.<p><b>heard all of this</b><br>The context of "all of this" refers to Jesus' teachings, particularly the parable of the shrewd manager (<a href="/luke/16.htm">Luke 16:1-13</a>), which emphasizes the proper use of wealth and the impossibility of serving both God and money. The Pharisees' reaction to Jesus' teachings reveals their inability to accept His message, which challenges their values and priorities. This moment is part of a larger narrative where Jesus consistently confronts the religious leaders' misunderstandings and misapplications of God's law.<p><b>and were scoffing at Jesus</b><br>The Pharisees' scoffing indicates their disdain and disbelief in Jesus' authority and message. This reaction is consistent with their general opposition to Jesus throughout the Gospels. Their scoffing can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah being rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). This rejection is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where Jesus is often met with skepticism and hostility by the religious elite, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>. The Pharisees' attitude also serves as a warning against pride and the danger of valuing human traditions over divine truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Genuine discipleship listens humbly, treasures Him above possessions, and lets His Word reshape motives and actions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And the Pharisees also, who were covetous.</span>--The words are important as showing that they had been listening during the previous parable, and that the words, though addressed to the disciples, had been meant also for them. (See Note on <a href="/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>.) The word for "covetous" is literally <span class= "ital">lovers of money,</span> as distinct from more general cupidity, and as being used by St. Paul in <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2Timothy 3:2</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament, furnishes another instance of community of language between him and the Evangelist.<p><span class= "bld">Derided him.</span>--The verb implies visible rather than audible signs of scorn--the distended nostril, and the sneering lip, the <span class= "ital">naso suspendere adunco</span> of the Roman satirist. It is, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a word that forcibly expresses the physiognomy of contempt (see <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>). Here again we have a word common to the two writers just named. The motive of the derision lies on the surface. That they, the teachers of Israel, should be told that they were like the Unjust Steward, that they were wasting their Lord's goods, that they must make friends with the unrighteous mammon of quite another kind than those whom they were wont to court--this was more than they could stand. They have felt the force of the rebuke, and therefore they stifle it with mockery--<p>"A little grain of conscience made them sour."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him</span>. This shows that many of the dominant sect had been present and had listened to the parable of the unjust steward. Although scrupulous, and in a way religious men, these Pharisees were notorious for their respect and regard for riches, and all that riches purchase, and they felt, no doubt deeply, the Lord's bitter reproach of covetousness. <span class="accented">They</span>, the rulers and leaders of Israel, the religious guides, were evidently attacked in such teaching as they had been lately listening to, not the common people whom they so despised. The scornful words alluded to in the expression, "they derided him," were no doubt directed against the outward poverty of the popular Galilaean Teacher. "It is all very well," they would say, "for one springing from the ranks of the people, landless, moneyless, to rail at wealth and the possessors of wealth; we can understand such teaching from one such as <span class="accented">you."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
