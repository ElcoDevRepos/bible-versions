The context is a large crowd pressing around Him, highlighting His popularity and the desperation of the people seeking His miracles. Jesus's question is significant because it demonstrates His awareness of individual faith amidst a multitude. It also underscores His divine knowledge and the personal nature of His ministry. This moment foreshadows the personal relationship believers can have with Christ, as He is aware of each person's needs and faith. The question also sets the stage for the revelation of the woman's faith, who had been suffering from a bleeding condition for twelve years, symbolizing the power of faith to reach out and receive healing from Jesus.<p><b>But they all denied it.</b><br>The crowd's denial reflects the anonymity and fear often associated with approaching Jesus. It also highlights the human tendency to avoid drawing attention to oneself, especially in a public setting. This denial can be seen as a contrast to the woman's bold faith, as she eventually comes forward to confess. The crowd's reaction is typical of human nature, where people may be hesitant to admit their actions or faith publicly. This moment emphasizes the importance of personal confession and the courage it takes to step forward in faith.<p><b>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Peter,</b><br>Peter, often the spokesperson for the disciples, addresses Jesus with respect, using the term "Master." This title acknowledges Jesus's authority and leadership among the disciples. Peter's role in this narrative is consistent with his character throughout the Gospels, where he frequently speaks up and acts impulsively. His use of "Master" also reflects the disciples' growing understanding of Jesus's identity, though they do not yet fully comprehend His divine nature. This interaction is part of Peter's journey of faith, which will culminate in his eventual recognition of Jesus as the Christ.<p><b>&#8220;the people are crowding and pressing against You.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's observation points to the physical reality of the situation, with the crowd pressing in on Jesus. This detail provides a vivid picture of the scene, emphasizing the chaos and urgency surrounding Jesus's ministry. The crowd's behavior is typical of the time, as people sought physical proximity to Jesus, hoping for healing or a miracle. This pressing crowd can be seen as a metaphor for the world's demands on Jesus, yet He remains focused on individual needs. The scene also highlights the contrast between the physical touch of the crowd and the faith-filled touch of the woman, which drew power from Jesus. This distinction underscores the theme of faith as the key to accessing Jesus's healing and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, demonstrating His divine awareness and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, often acting as a spokesperson for the group.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the multitude of people following Jesus, eager to be near Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>Though not mentioned in this specific verse, she is the one who touched Jesus, seeking healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Occurs as Jesus is on His way to heal Jairus' daughter, highlighting His power and authority over sickness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_awareness.htm">Divine Awareness</a></b><br>Jesus is aware of our needs even in the midst of a crowd.
