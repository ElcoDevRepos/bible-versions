He commands practical preparedness&#8212;money, supplies, even limited means of self-defense&#8212;while they continue gospel work. The verse teaches responsible planning, courageous trust, and readiness for hardship, all under Christ&#8217;s sovereign authority and in literal expectation of real-world challenges.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">He that hath a purse, let him take it.</span>--The word for "purse" is the same as in <a href="/luke/10-4.htm" title="Carry neither purse, nor money, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.">Luke 10:4</a>, where see Note. On "scrip," see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-10.htm" title="Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.">Matthew 10:10</a>. If the words had stopped short of the "sword," we could have received their literal meaning without difficulty. They would have seemed to counsel the prudence which provides for want, instead of a simple trust, as before, in the providence of God, and so would have sanctioned all equitable forms of Church organisation and endowment. The mention of the "sword," however, introduces a new element of thought. Our Lord's words to Peter (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.">Matthew 26:52</a>) show that the disciples were not meant to use it in His defence. It is not likely that He would teach them to use it in their own, as they preached the gospel of the Kingdom. True teachers felt afterwards that the weapons of their warfare were not carnal (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a>). What follows supplies a probable explanation. The Master knew that two of the disciples (Peter and another) had brought swords with them, and with that acceptance of the thoughts of others which we have so often traced, He sadly, and yet, as it were, with the gentle sympathy with which a man speaks to those who are children in age or character, conveyed His warnings in the form which met their fears and hopes. If they meant to trust in swords, a time was coming when they would sorely need them.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Now,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">however,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
