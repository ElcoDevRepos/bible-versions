This relationship underscores the divine orchestration in the lives of both families. Elizabeth, from the priestly line of Aaron, connects the Old Testament priesthood with the New Testament's unfolding story of redemption. The mention of Elizabeth also emphasizes the miraculous nature of her pregnancy, setting the stage for the even greater miracle of the virgin birth of Jesus.<p><b>has conceived a son in her old age</b><br>Elizabeth's conception is a miraculous event, reminiscent of Sarah's late-in-life pregnancy with Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>). This parallel reinforces the theme of God's power to fulfill His promises despite human limitations. The birth of John the Baptist to elderly parents signifies the breaking of natural barriers, preparing the way for the Messiah. It also serves as a sign to Mary of God's ability to perform the impossible, encouraging her faith in the angel's message.<p><b>and she who was called barren</b><br>Elizabeth's previous barrenness is significant, as barrenness was often seen as a reproach or curse in ancient Jewish culture (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6-7</a>). Her condition being reversed by God's intervention highlights His compassion and ability to transform shame into joy. This transformation is a recurring biblical theme, illustrating God's redemptive work in the lives of His people. It also prefigures the spiritual fruitfulness that comes through faith in God's promises.<p><b>is in her sixth month</b><br>The specific mention of the sixth month provides a timeline for the events surrounding the births of John the Baptist and Jesus. It situates the narrative within a historical context, emphasizing the reality of these events. This detail also serves to confirm the angel's message to Mary, offering tangible evidence of God's active involvement in human history. The timing underscores the precision of God's plan, as John's birth precedes and prepares the way for Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b><br>A relative of Mary, the mother of John the Baptist.
