The act of calling a servant indicates the man's position of authority and his expectation of receiving reliable information. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient households, where servants were expected to be knowledgeable about the affairs of the household. Theologically, this can be seen as a parallel to how believers are called to serve and be attentive to the needs and questions of others, reflecting the servant leadership exemplified by Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>and asked what was going on.</b><br>The inquiry about the situation suggests a lack of awareness or understanding, which is a recurring theme in the parables of Jesus. This moment of questioning can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual curiosity or the search for truth. In the broader context of <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, which includes the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, this question highlights the theme of seeking and understanding the joy of redemption and reconciliation. It also connects to the idea of seeking wisdom and understanding, as encouraged in <a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>, where the pursuit of knowledge is likened to searching for hidden treasures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_older_brother.htm">The Older Brother</a></b><br>In the parable of the Prodigal Son, the older brother represents those who are faithful yet struggle with self-righteousness and jealousy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>A minor character in the parable, the servant provides information to the older brother about the celebration for the return of the prodigal son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Symbolizing God, the father in the parable is a figure of grace and forgiveness, welcoming back the repentant son.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>Represents sinners who repent and return to God, receiving His grace and forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_celebration.htm">The Celebration</a></b><br>A feast held by the father to celebrate the return of the prodigal son, symbolizing the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_grace.htm">Understanding Grace</a></b><br>The parable teaches that God's grace is available to all, regardless of past actions.

Rather than barging into the house, he pauses to gather facts&#8212;an orderly, rational step that shows he values truth before reaction (cf. <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; His initiative highlights personal responsibility; nobody forces him to inquire. In the wider context of Jesus&#8217; audience, religious leaders also needed to investigate God&#8217;s work instead of dismissing it (cf. <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>; <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one of the servants</b><p>&#8226; Servants in a household typically handled routine matters, yet they often possessed inside knowledge (cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>). The older son chooses someone accessible and informed.<p>&#8226; The term underscores rank: the son, though heir, stoops to converse with a servant. This contrast mirrors the Father&#8217;s willingness to reach sinners of every status (cf. <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Servants in Jesus&#8217; parables frequently picture believers who witness and report the Master&#8217;s activities (cf. <a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>). Here the servant becomes a messenger of grace about to be explained.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked</b><p>&#8226; He &#8220;asked&#8221; rather than assumed. Scripture commends seeking understanding (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; His question anticipates revelation. Just as he turns to a servant for clarity, so listeners are invited to turn to God&#8217;s Word for answers (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The request exposes his heart; inquiry often precedes either joy or resentment. What he does with the information will reveal his attitude toward the father&#8217;s mercy (cf. <a href="/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what was going on</b><p>&#8226; The older son senses something extraordinary. The celebration is no ordinary event; it signifies restoration and grace (<a href="/luke/15-24.htm">Luke 15:24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;What was going on&#8221; echoes the heavenly perspective on repentance: &#8220;there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Noise of rejoicing foreshadows the marriage supper of the Lamb, where redeemed sinners are honored (<a href="/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6-9</a>). The verse thus sets the stage for the father&#8217;s explanation and exposes the son&#8217;s pending decision&#8212;whether to join the joy or remain outside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/15-26.htm">Luke 15:26</a> records the pivotal moment when the older son pauses to gather information about the father&#8217;s joyful festivities. His deliberate call, respectful approach to a servant, and earnest question illustrate responsible inquiry and frame the contrast between legalistic distance and relational celebration. The verse invites every reader to investigate God&#8217;s gracious work and choose participation in His redeeming joy rather than stand aloof.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
