In the cultural context of the first century, following Jesus often meant facing persecution and social ostracism. The call to not be ashamed is a challenge to remain steadfast in faith despite societal pressures. Biblically, this connects to <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul declares he is not ashamed of the gospel. It also echoes the call to boldness in faith found throughout the New Testament.<p><b>the Son of Man will be ashamed of him</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a figure given authority and glory by God. Jesus frequently uses this title for Himself, highlighting both His humanity and divine authority. The warning here is a reciprocal relationship: those who deny Christ will face denial from Him. This is consistent with <a href="/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>, where Jesus states that whoever denies Him before others will be denied before the Father.<p><b>when He comes in His glory</b><br>This phrase refers to the Second Coming of Christ, a future event anticipated in Christian eschatology. The glory mentioned here signifies the divine majesty and authority with which Jesus will return, contrasting with His first coming in humility. This is supported by passages like <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, which describe the visible and powerful return of Christ.<p><b>and in the glory of the Father</b><br>The glory of the Father underscores the divine approval and authority behind Jesus' return. It reflects the unity between the Father and the Son, as seen in <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of the glory He shared with the Father before the world began. This also ties into the Trinitarian understanding of God, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one in essence and purpose.<p><b>and of the holy angels</b><br>The mention of holy angels highlights the heavenly entourage that will accompany Christ at His return. Angels are often depicted as messengers and servants of God, participating in divine judgment and worship. This is seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, where the Son of Man comes in glory with all the angels, and <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, which describes Jesus being revealed from heaven with His mighty angels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, referring to Himself as the "Son of Man," a title that emphasizes both His humanity and His divine authority.

The One unwillingly owned on earth will withhold acknowledgment in heaven (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32&#8211;33</a>). Two outcomes stand in stark contrast:<p>&#8226; Those who stand with Christ now will be warmly received (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Those who shrink back will face His disapproval, a loss no earthly favor can offset (<a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38&#8211;39</a>).<p>This is not about losing salvation by a momentary lapse but about revealing the true state of the heart. Consistent, settled shame toward Christ exposes a life never truly yielded to Him (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when He comes in His glory</b><p>The setting is Christ&#8217;s visible, triumphant return.

His &#8220;glory&#8221; is the radiance of His deity (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>). Today the world may ridicule Him; on that day no one will mistake His majesty (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>). The time for quiet discipleship will have passed; only the verdict remains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in the glory of the Father</b><p>Jesus does not return alone. He shares the Father&#8217;s glory because He shares the Father&#8217;s nature (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>; 5:23). The scene is a joint manifestation of divine honor, confirming that rejecting the Son is rejecting the Father who sent Him (<a href="/john/15-23.htm">John 15:23</a>). The judgment platform is backed by all the authority of heaven (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of the holy angels</b><p>Holy angels, unfallen and unashamed servants of God (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>), stand as witnesses.

Their presence underscores the cosmic scope of this moment: heaven&#8217;s armies align with their King against all who disowned Him. Nothing could be more public or final.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a> draws a straight line from present allegiance to future recognition. Refusing to identify with Jesus and His words now leads to His refusal to identify with us then. The returning Christ, backed by the Father&#8217;s glory and the armies of heaven, will honor those who honored Him and expose those who were ashamed. Bold, unwavering confession of Christ today is the path to eternal welcome in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">In his own glory, and in his Father's.</span>--The first part of the clause is peculiar, in this report of our Lord's words, to St. Luke, and presents a point of agreement with those recorded in <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels</span>. Here follows the punishment in the world to come. It consists in the Judge's solemn award to the man who has succeeded in saving his life in this world. The award is, "Depart from me: I know you not." Of such a selfish soul, who here has loved his own ease, and has declined all self-sacrifice, will the Son of man, in the day of his glory, be justly ashamed. The suffering Messiah thus completed his vivid picture of himself. Not always was he to suffer, or to wear the robe of humiliation. The Despised and Rejected would assuredly return with a glory indescribable, inconceivable. His assertion, advanced here, that <span class="accented">he</span> will return as Almighty Judge, is very remarkable. In the parallel passage in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>) it is put even more clearly. There Jesus asks his disciples, "Whom do men say that <span class="accented">I</span>, <span class="accented">the Son of man</span>, am?" In ver. 27 Jesus goes on to say, "The <span class="accented">Son of man</span> shall come in the glory of <span class="accented">his</span> Father, with <span class="accented">his</span> angels, and then <span class="accented">he</span> shall reward every man according to his works." The lesson was very clear. His own might surely be content. Only let them be patient. Lo! in <span class="accented">the</span> poor rejected Rabbi now before them, going to his bitter suffering and his death, they were looking really on the awful form of the Almighty Judge of quick and dead. These words, very dimly understood <span class="accented">then</span>, in days to come were often recalled by his hearers. They formed the groundwork of many a primitive apostolic sermon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is ashamed of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#967;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(epaischynth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be ashamed, be ashamed of.
