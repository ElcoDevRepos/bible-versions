The Jewish system typically had three watches, while the Roman system had four. The second and third watches would correspond to late night and early morning hours, times when people are usually asleep. This phrase emphasizes the unexpected timing of the master's return, highlighting the need for constant vigilance. Biblically, this can be connected to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where readiness for the bridegroom's arrival is crucial. The imagery of night watches also ties into the theme of spiritual alertness found in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-6</a>, where believers are encouraged to stay awake and sober, anticipating the Lord's return.<p><b>and finds them alert</b><br>The concept of being alert is central to the teachings of Jesus regarding His second coming. In the cultural context, servants were expected to be ready to serve their master at any time, reflecting loyalty and diligence. Spiritually, this alertness symbolizes a life of faithfulness and readiness for Christ's return. This idea is echoed in <a href="/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33-37</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to be watchful. The call to be alert is a reminder of the unpredictability of the Lord's return and the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God at all times.<p><b>those servants will be blessed</b><br>The blessing promised to the alert servants underscores the reward for faithfulness and readiness. In biblical terms, blessing often signifies divine favor and approval. This promise of blessing can be seen as an assurance of eternal reward for those who remain faithful to Christ. The theme of reward for vigilance is also present in <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>, where those who stay awake and keep their garments are blessed. This phrase serves as an encouragement to believers to persevere in their faith and to live in anticipation of the Lord's return, knowing that their efforts will be recognized and rewarded by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, teaching His disciples about readiness and vigilance in anticipation of His return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Represent believers who are expected to remain watchful and prepared for the Master's return.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes Jesus, who will return at an unexpected time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_and_third_watch.htm">Second and Third Watch</a></b><br>Refers to the Roman division of the night into four watches, with the second watch being from 9 PM to midnight and the third from midnight to 3 AM.

(See Note there.) Here we find the older Jewish division into three watches.

Among the Jews at the time of our Lord, the old division of the night into three watches had given place to the ordinary Roman division into four. They were reckoned thus: from six to nine, from nine to midnight, from midnight to three, and from three to six. In this parable the second and third watches are mentioned as necessary for the completeness of the picture; for the <span class="accented">banquet</span> would certainly not be over before the end of the first watch, and in the fourth the <span class="accented">day</span> would be breaking. The second and third watches, then, represent the still and weary hours of the night, when to watch is indeed a task of difficulty and painfulness; and here again the Lord repeats his high encomium on such devoted conduct in his second "blessed are those servants." It is perfectly clear that in this parable the master's return signifies the coming of Christ. The whole tone, then, is a grave reminder to us, to all impatient ones, that the great event <span class="accented">may</span> be long delayed, much longer than most Christian thinkers dream; but it tells us, too. that this long delay involves a test of their loyalty. "The parousia does not come so quickly as impatience, nor yet so late as carelessness, supposes" (Van Oosterzee). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#7938;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2579.htm">Strong's 2579: </a> </span><span class="str2">And if, even if, even, at least.
