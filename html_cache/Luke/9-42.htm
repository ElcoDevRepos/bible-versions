The boy's approach signifies the faith of those bringing him to Jesus, reminiscent of other instances where individuals sought Jesus for healing (e.g., the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43-48</a>). The act of approaching Jesus is a demonstration of faith and desperation, common themes in the Gospels.<p><b>the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion</b><br>This violent reaction underscores the destructive nature of demonic possession, a common understanding in the first-century Jewish context. The convulsion is indicative of the spiritual battle taking place, as seen in other exorcism accounts (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a>). The physical manifestation of the spiritual struggle is a reminder of the reality of spiritual warfare.<p><b>But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit</b><br>The authority of Jesus over demonic forces is a central theme in the Gospels. His rebuke is immediate and effective, demonstrating His divine power and fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah's authority over evil (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). This act is a type of the ultimate victory over Satan, foreshadowing the defeat of evil through the cross and resurrection.<p><b>healed the boy</b><br>The healing signifies restoration and wholeness, a hallmark of Jesus' ministry. It reflects the compassion of Christ and His mission to bring physical and spiritual healing. This act of healing is a fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah's healing works.<p><b>and gave him back to his father</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the restoration of relationships and the return to community, a significant aspect of Jesus' miracles. The act of giving the boy back to his father symbolizes reconciliation and the restoration of familial bonds, echoing the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).

St. Peter supplied St. Mark with fuller details here, and especially adds one priceless gem of instruction in the Christian life. The Lord told the father of the suffering child that the granting of the boon he craved for his son depended on his own faith. Then the poor father, won by the Divine goodness manifest in every act and word of Jesus, stammered out that pitiful, loving expression, re-echoed since in so many thousand hearts, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."
