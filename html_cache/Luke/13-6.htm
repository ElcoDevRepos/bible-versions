This particular parable is part of a series of teachings in <a href="/luke/13.htm">Luke 13</a>, where Jesus addresses themes of repentance and judgment.<p><b>A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard.</b><br>Fig trees were common in Israel and often symbolized the nation itself (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>). Vineyards were valuable and carefully tended, representing God's care and investment in His people.

In the context of Israel, it points to the nation&#8217;s spiritual barrenness despite God&#8217;s blessings and care.

Originally aimed at Israel, the message reaches every hearer today: abundant grace must result in authentic, visible fruit, for patient mercy will not wait forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">A certain man had a fig tree.</span>--The parable stands obviously in very close connection with the foregoing teaching. The people had been warned of the danger of perishing, unless they repented. They are now taught that the forbearance and long-suffering of God are leading them to repentance. The sharp warning of the Baptist, "Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down" (<a href="/matthew/3-10.htm" title="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a>), is expanded into a parable. As regards the outward framework of the story, we have only to note that the joint culture of the fig-tree and the vine was so common as to have passed into a proverb (<a href="/2_kings/18-31.htm" title="Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat you every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his cistern:">2Kings 18:31</a>; <a href="/songs/2-13.htm" title="The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.">Song of Solomon 2:13</a>). The interpretation of the parable as to its general drift is easy enough. The barren fig-tree is the symbol of a fruitless profession of godliness; the delay represents the forbearance of God in allowing yet a time for repentance. When we come to details, however, serious difficulties present themselves. If we take the fig-tree as representing Israel, what are we to make of the vineyard? If the owner of the vineyard be Christ, who is the vine-dresser? Do the three years refer to the actual duration of our Lord's ministry? Answers to these questions will be found in the following considerations:--(1) The vineyard is uniformly in the parabolic language of Scripture the symbol of Israel. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33</a>.) (2) The owner of that vineyard is none other than the great King, the Lord of Hosts (<a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm" title="For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.">Isaiah 5:7</a>). (3) If this be so, then the fig-tree must stand for something else than Israel as a nation, and the context points to its being the symbol of the individual soul, which inheriting its place in a divine order, is as a tree planted in the garden of the Lord. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm" title="And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-8.htm" title="If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.">Jeremiah 18:8</a>.) (4) The "three years" in which the owner comes seeking fruit can, on this view, answer neither to the three stages of Revelation--Patriarchal, Mosaic, and Prophetic--nor the three years of our Lord's ministry, but represent, as the symbol of completeness, the full opportunities given to men, the calls to repentance and conversion which come to them in the several stages of their lives in youth, manhood, age. (5) The dresser of the vineyard, following the same line of thought, is the Lord Jesus Himself, who intercedes, as for the nation as a whole, so for each individual member of the nation. He pleads for delay. He will do what can be done by "digging" into the fallow ground of the soul, and by imparting new sources of nourishment or fruitfulness. If these avail, well. If not, the fig-tree, by implication every fig-tree in the vineyard that continued barren, would be cut down. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He spake also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard</span>. And then, without any further prelude, Jesus spoke this parable of the barren fig tree, which contained, in language scarcely veiled at all, warnings to Israel as a nation - the most sombre and threatening he had yet given utterance to. "Hear, O people," said the Master. "In the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is a fig tree, long planted there, but utterly unfruitful. It is now on its last trial; indeed, were it not for the intercession of the Gardener, the Lord of the vineyard had already pronounced its final doom." "The very intercession, though, is ominous; the Vinedresser shows his mercifulness by deprecating immediate cutting down, but the careful specification of conditions, and the limitation of the period within which experiments are to be made, intimate that peril is imminent... The restriction of the intercession of the Vinedresser for a single year's grace indicates Christ's own sympathy with this Divine rigour... The Vinedresser knows that, though God is long-suffering, yet his patience as exhibited in the history of his dealings with men is exhaustible, and that in Israel's case it is now all but worn out. And he sympathizes with the Divine impatience with chronic and incurable sterility" (Professor Bruce). <span class="cmt_word">A fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none</span>. It is not an uncommon practice to plant fig trees at the corners of vineyards, thus utilizing every available spot of ground. Still the Lord's choice of a fig tree as the symbol of Israel, the chosen people, is at first sight strange. This image was no doubt selected to show those Pharisees and other Jews, proud of what they considered their unassailable position as the elect of the Eternal, that, after all, the position they occupied was but that of a fig tree in the corner of the vineyard of the world - planted there and watched over so long as it promised to serve the Lord of the vineyard's purpose; if it ceased to do that, if it gave no further promise of fruit, then it would be ruthlessly cut down. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
