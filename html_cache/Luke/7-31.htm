The use of rhetorical questions is a common teaching method in Jewish tradition, prompting listeners to reflect deeply. The term "generation" often refers to a group of people living at the same time, but in biblical context, it can also imply a moral or spiritual condition. Jesus frequently criticized the spiritual blindness and hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes, as seen in <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>. This comparison sets the stage for a parable or analogy, a method Jesus often used to convey deeper truths (<a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>What are they like?</b><br>This question introduces a simile or metaphor, a common teaching tool in the Bible, to illustrate a spiritual truth. Jesus often used everyday experiences and cultural references familiar to His audience to make His teachings relatable and understandable. The question invites the audience to self-reflect and consider their own spiritual state. In the broader context of <a href="/luke/7.htm">Luke 7</a>, Jesus had just spoken about John the Baptist, highlighting the people's varied responses to God's messengers. This reflects a theme throughout the Gospels where Jesus contrasts the faith of the humble and repentant with the skepticism of the self-righteous (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the crowd, offering a critique of the current generation's spiritual state.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_this_generation.htm">The Men of This Generation</a></b><br>Refers to the people living during Jesus' time, particularly those who were skeptical or dismissive of His and John the Baptist's ministries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, which includes His disciples, followers, and possibly some Pharisees and teachers of the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is a key figure in the surrounding context, as Jesus contrasts His ministry with John's.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_experts_in_the_law.htm">Pharisees and Experts in the Law</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often opposed Jesus and John, representing the skeptical and unresponsive attitudes Jesus critiques.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Evaluate how we respond to God's message today.

He sought for some homely, popular simile which would drive home to the listeners' hearts his sad and solemn judgment of the conduct of the ruling Jews of this time. The generation he was then addressing had been singularly blessed with two great Divine messages - the one delivered by that eminent servant of God, John, about whom he had been speaking in such glowing, earnest terms; the other message was his own. He chose for his purpose one of those everyday scenes from the people's life, a scene which they had witnessed often, and in which, no doubt, in past days many of the by-standers themselves had taken a part - one of those child-games which the little ones in his day were wont to play in the summer evenings, and in which, likely enough, <span class="accented">he</span> in his boyish years had often shared in, as he played in the little market-place of Nazareth. He likened the wayward men of that generation to a group of children of the people in some open space of the city, now <span class="accented">playing at rejoicings</span>, such as take place at wedding festivities, now <span class="accented">at wailings</span>, which in Eastern countries accompany funerals; that is to say, the little group would divide itself into two companies, and one would say to the other, "Come, now we will play at a wedding; here are the pipers and the singers, do you come and dance and make merry;" but the others would not. Then the little company of would-be merrymakers would beat their breasts and cry with pretended sorrow; but the others still declined to join in the game of mourning - would not play "at a funeral," just as they refused to join in the game of "rejoicing at a wedding." To such a band of imperious little ones, who were angry if the others did not at once comply with their demands, Jesus compared the wayward and evil generation in which he and John lived. Had they not found bitter fault with John because he had declined to have anything to do with their wicked self-indulgent feasting and luxury? How often had Pharisee and scribe railed with bitter railings against Jesus because he would have nothing to do with their false and hypocritical fastings, with their pretended shrinking from what they deemed unclean and unworthy of them! Dr. Morrison puts it rightly, and forcibly: "They were dissatisfied with John, and would have nothing to do with him." If we are to have reformers, commend us to such as come near us, and visit our houses, and sit at our tables, and are sociable like ourselves.' They pretended, on the other hand, to scorn Jesus, who, while making so lofty a profession, yet went about eating and drinking in people's houses, and even in the homes of publicans and sinners. 'He should have gone into the desert and lived an abstemious life .... Commend us to ascetic men for our reformers.'" The line of interpretation which seems to us simpler and fitted to the framework of the little parable is in the main thus adopted by Meyer, Dr. W. Bleek, Bishop Wordsworth, and Dean Plumptre. "You men of this generation," writes Bishop Wordsworth, "are like a troop of wayward children, who go on with their own game, at one time gay, at another grave, and give heed to no one else, and expect that every one should conform to them. You were angry with John because he would not dance to your piping, and with me because 1 will not weep to your dirge; John censured your licentiousness, I rebuke your hypocrisy; you vilify both, and reject the good counsel of God, who has devised a variety of means for your salvation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;To what,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#957;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Tini)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
