The "pods" refer to carob pods, which were commonly used as animal fodder in the ancient Near East. The carob tree, native to the Mediterranean region, produces pods that are edible but not typically consumed by humans unless in dire circumstances. This detail underscores the son's extreme poverty and hunger, as he desires even the food meant for pigs, considered unclean animals in Jewish culture (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). This reflects the depth of his fall from grace and the consequences of his reckless living. The imagery of longing for pig food emphasizes the degradation and humiliation he experiences, symbolizing the spiritual emptiness and moral bankruptcy that result from sin.<p><b>but no one would give him a thing</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the complete abandonment and isolation the prodigal son faces. In the cultural context of the time, hospitality and community support were vital, yet he finds himself utterly alone and without aid. This lack of assistance highlights the consequences of his earlier decisions to squander his inheritance and sever ties with his family and community. The phrase also serves as a metaphor for the spiritual state of those who turn away from God, emphasizing the emptiness and lack of fulfillment found in a life apart from divine provision. This situation sets the stage for the son's eventual repentance and return to his father, mirroring the biblical theme of God's readiness to forgive and restore those who seek Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who squandered his inheritance and found himself in dire need, representing a sinner who has strayed from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_country.htm">The Far Country</a></b><br>A place symbolizing separation from God and a life of sin and indulgence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pigs.htm">The Pigs</a></b><br>Unclean animals in Jewish culture, representing the depth of the prodigal son's fall and his association with sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pods.htm">The Pods</a></b><br>The food given to pigs, symbolizing the emptiness and unfulfilling nature of a life lived apart from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lack_of_provision.htm">The Lack of Provision</a></b><br>The fact that "no one would give him a thing" highlights the isolation and desperation that comes from living in sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to spiritual and sometimes physical destitution.

It is open to suppose either that they shrank from the reading in the text as too coarse, or that the later MSS. introduced "filled his belly" as more vivid and colloquial; or, as seems probable, that there may have been a variation of phrase even in the original autograph MSS. of St. Luke.<p><span class= "bld">The husks that the swine did eat.</span>--The word is generic, but it is commonly identified with the long bean-like pods of the carob-tree, or <span class= "ital">Ceratonia siliqua,</span> or St. John's bread, in which some have seen the "locusts" of <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>. They contain a good deal of saccharine matter, and are commonly used as food for swine in Syria and Egypt. Spiritually, they answer to the sensual pleasures in which men who are as the swine, identified with brute appetites, find adequate sustenance. The soul that was born to a higher inheritance cannot so satisfy itself. It seeks to be "like a beast with lower pleasures," but it is part of the Father's discipline that that baser satisfaction is beyond its reach.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him</span>. So low was this poor lost man reduced, that in his bitter hunger he even came to long for the coarse but nutritious bean with which the herd was fed. These swine were of some value when fattened for the market; but he, the swineherd, was valueless - he might starve. The husks in question were the long bean-shaped pods of the carob tree (<span class="accented">Caratonia siliqua</span>), commonly used for fattening swine in Syria and Egypt. They contain a proportion of sugar. The very poorest of the population occasionally use them as food. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He longed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#952;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(epethymei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1937.htm">Strong's 1937: </a> </span><span class="str2">To long for, covet, lust after, set the heart upon.
