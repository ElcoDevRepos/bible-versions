The number seven often symbolizes completeness or fullness in biblical literature, suggesting a complete or intensified state of evil. This can be connected to the idea of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded of the struggle against spiritual forces of evil. The concept of spirits working together to increase their influence is a warning against complacency in spiritual matters.<p><b>and they go in and dwell there</b><br>The use of "dwell" indicates a permanent or settled presence, suggesting that once these spirits enter, they establish a stronghold. This reflects the cultural understanding of possession during the time of Jesus, where spirits were believed to inhabit and control individuals. The importance of spiritual vigilance is underscored here, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which warns believers to be sober-minded and watchful against the devil's schemes.<p><b>And the final plight of that man is worse than the first.</b><br>This phrase serves as a sobering conclusion, emphasizing the severe consequences of failing to fill one's life with the presence of God after experiencing deliverance. It echoes the warning found in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> about the dangers of falling away after having once been enlightened. The historical context of Jesus' ministry, where He often encountered and cast out demons, provides a backdrop for understanding the seriousness of spiritual emptiness. This also serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where true deliverance and protection come through a relationship with Him, as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, where abiding in Christ is essential for spiritual fruitfulness and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirit.htm">The Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>Represents evil or demonic forces that can influence or possess individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes a person who has been freed from demonic influence but fails to fill the void with righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_other_spirits.htm">Seven Other Spirits</a></b><br>Indicates a complete or intensified return of evil, as the number seven often signifies completeness in the Bible.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Metaphorically represents the person's life or soul, which can be occupied by either good or evil.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_teaching.htm">Jesus' Teaching</a></b><br>This event is part of Jesus' broader teaching on spiritual warfare and the importance of true repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_spiritual_emptiness.htm">The Danger of Spiritual Emptiness</a></b><br>When a person is freed from sin or evil, it is crucial to fill that void with God's presence and righteousness.

The passage underscores literal spiritual warfare, the futility of mere moral reform, and the necessity of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s indwelling to secure lasting freedom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first</span>. As instances of such a terrible possession, not improbably the result of a relapse such as is above portrayed, might be cited the cases of Mary Magdalene, out of whom we are told went seven devils, and of the Gergesene demoniac, who was possessed by a swarm or legion of these unclean spirits. There is another well-known historical reference contained in these words of Jesus, which speak of the triumphant return of the temporarily banished devil. In this, the chosen people represent the one possessed; the expelled devil was the one besetting sin which from the time of the Exodus to the Captivity - that fearsome idolatry with its attendant mischief - exercised over Israel a strange and horrible fascination. After the return from exile, idolatry seemed driven out for ever. But the house was only empty; there was no indwelling Presence there of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, only an outward show of ceremonies and of rites, only a religion of the lips, nor; of the heart; and so the old state of possession returned under the form of hypocrisy, envy, narrowness, jealousy, covetousness. The Jewish historian, Josephus, has dared to paint the picture of national degradation which closed in the sack and burning of the city and temple (A.D. 70). But this striking application belongs to St. Matthew, who represents our Lord closing his sad sketch of the return of the devils with the words, "Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation." It may have been that Jesus prolonged on this occasion the terrible sermon, and drew out lesson upon lesson suggested by his words; but it is more likely that St. Matthew is writing of another occasion, when, taunted with working with the aid of the devil, the Master spoke similar words, drawing from them other lessons. The general lesson to be learned - if the above exegesis be in the main followed - is the utter hopelessness of attempting any work which has as its object the amelioration of the human race <span class="accented">without the aid of Christ.</span> Earnestness and imposture will alike in the end fail here. The case of the one of whom the disciples complained to their Master as casting out devils, but who followed not with them, was very different. <span class="accented">Here</span> the Lord said, "Forbid him not: he that is not against us is for us." The good work in this case was done, we read, <span class="accented">in the Name of Christ</span>: hence the Divine approval. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
