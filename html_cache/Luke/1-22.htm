His inability to speak was a direct result of his encounter with the angel Gabriel, who announced the forthcoming birth of John the Baptist. This muteness served as a sign of the divine nature of the message. In biblical context, being struck mute is often associated with divine intervention or judgment (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>). The temple, where this event occurred, was the center of Jewish worship and a place where God's presence was believed to dwell, making it a fitting location for such a significant revelation.<p><b>they realized he had seen a vision in the temple</b><br>The people outside the temple understood that Zechariah had experienced a supernatural event. Visions were a common way God communicated with His people, as seen with prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel. The temple setting underscores the sacredness of the vision, as it was a place where God often revealed His will. This vision was significant because it heralded the coming of John the Baptist, who would prepare the way for Jesus Christ, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>.<p><b>He kept making signs to them</b><br>Zechariah's use of signs indicates his effort to communicate despite his muteness. This action highlights the human struggle to convey divine experiences. The use of signs can be seen throughout Scripture, such as Moses using signs to communicate God's power to Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>). This also foreshadows the importance of signs in the ministry of Jesus, who performed miracles as signs of His divine authority.<p><b>but remained unable to speak</b><br>The continued inability to speak emphasizes the seriousness of the angel's message and the fulfillment of Gabriel's words (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>). This silence lasted until the naming of John, symbolizing the completion of God's promise. It serves as a reminder of the power and authority of God's word, as well as the importance of faith and obedience. This muteness can also be seen as a type of Christ's silence before His accusers, demonstrating submission to God's will (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, serving in the temple.

It underscores the gravity of unbelief (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1-2</a>) and the mercy that still allows him to serve (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His silence turns the congregation&#8217;s focus from the priest to the God who disciplines and restores (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they realized he had seen a vision in the temple</b><p>Seeing Zechariah speechless, the people connect the dots;

Their realization echoes Daniel&#8217;s companions sensing but not seeing the heavenly visitor (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses observable signs to confirm hidden realities, preparing hearts for the coming Messiah who will be revealed in the same sanctuary (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He kept making signs to them</b><p>Unable to talk, Zechariah resorts to gestures.<p>&#8226;

When Zechariah&#8217;s tongue is finally loosed, he glorifies God&#8212;evidence that divine correction yields righteous fruit (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a> records a dramatic, public confirmation that God&#8217;s message to Zechariah is true.

Something in the face of the old man, as, unable to speak, he made signs to the congregation, told the awestruck people that the long delay and the loss of speech were owing to no sudden illness which had seized Zacharias. We know that, in the old days of the desert wanderings, the children of Israel could not bear to look on the face of Moses when he came down from the mount after dwelling for a brief space in the light of the glory of the Eternal. Zacharias had been face to face with one whose blessed lot it was to stand for ever in the presence of God. We may well suppose that there lingered on the old man's face, as he left the sanctuary, something which told the beholder of the presence just left. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he came out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(exelth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
