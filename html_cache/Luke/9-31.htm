Their appearance in glory signifies their heavenly status and the divine approval of their presence. Moses represents the Law, and Elijah represents the Prophets, both of which find fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The glory also reflects the Shekinah, the visible manifestation of God's presence, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, such as in the Tabernacle and the Temple.<p><b>and spoke about His departure</b><br>The term "departure" is translated from the Greek word "exodus," which connects to the Old Testament narrative of the Israelites' liberation from Egypt. This indicates that Jesus' upcoming death, resurrection, and ascension are a new kind of exodus, leading to spiritual liberation for humanity. The conversation between Jesus, Moses, and Elijah underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>which He was about to accomplish</b><br>This phrase highlights the intentional and purposeful nature of Jesus' mission. His departure is not a tragic end but a fulfillment of divine prophecy and purpose. It emphasizes Jesus' role as the Messiah who willingly lays down His life for the salvation of mankind, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>at Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is significant as the city where many pivotal events in biblical history occur. It is the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship, and the place where Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection would take place.

The use of the word "decease" (<span class= "ital">exodos</span>) instead of "death" is remarkable: (1) because it had not been commonly so used by Greek authors; (2) because in its wider range of meaning it covered all the special phenomena connected with the close of the ministry of the Lawgiver and the Tishbite (comp. <a href="/context/deuteronomy/34-5.htm" title="So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 34:5-6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.">2Kings 2:11</a>), and not less so, the Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord, as well as the Crucifixion; (3) as meeting us in close connection with a reference to the Transfiguration in <a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which he should accomplish.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">which He was about to accomplish.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who appeared in glory</span>. Why were these two chosen as the Lord's companions on that solemn night? Probably <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because they were what may be termed the two great representative men of the chosen race of Israel. The one was the human author of the Divine Law which for so many centuries had been the guide and teacher of the covenant people.

The vista which lay immediately before Jesus, of rejection, desertion, the death of agony, and the dreadful sufferings which preceded it, - all this had been very present before him lately. He had dwelt upon these things, we know, to his own. He had pondered over them, no doubt, often when alone. It was not only in Gethsemane that his "soul was sorrowful even unto death." As in the garden-agony "appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him," so here on the mount came to him these glorified spirits for the same blessed purpose of ministering.
