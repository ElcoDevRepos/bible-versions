The phrase "that very hour" suggests a sense of urgency and excitement, reflecting the transformative impact of their encounter with Jesus. This immediate action underscores the importance of the resurrection message and the disciples' eagerness to share it.<p><b>and returned to Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem holds significant importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. The return to Jerusalem symbolizes a return to the heart of the early Christian community and the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies concerning His death and resurrection. This journey back to Jerusalem, approximately seven miles from Emmaus, also highlights the disciples' commitment and determination to be with the other followers of Christ.<p><b>There they found the Eleven</b><br>The "Eleven" refers to the remaining apostles, excluding Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Jesus and subsequently died. This gathering of the Eleven is significant as it represents the core group of Jesus' closest followers, who would become the foundational leaders of the early Church. The presence of the Eleven underscores the continuity and unity of the apostolic witness to the resurrection.<p><b>and those with them,</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Eleven were not alone; they were accompanied by other disciples and followers of Jesus. This larger group likely included both men and women who had been part of Jesus' ministry. The mention of "those with them" highlights the communal nature of the early Christian movement and the shared experience of witnessing the risen Christ.<p><b>gathered together</b><br>The act of gathering together emphasizes the communal and supportive environment of the early believers. This assembly reflects the early Church's practice of meeting for fellowship, prayer, and mutual encouragement. The gathering also serves as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that where two or three are gathered in His name, He is present among them (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). This communal gathering becomes a setting for the sharing of the resurrection news and the strengthening of faith among the believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_on_the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Disciples on the Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus who were traveling to Emmaus when they encountered the risen Christ.
