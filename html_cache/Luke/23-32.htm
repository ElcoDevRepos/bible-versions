The term "criminals" indicates that these individuals were likely guilty of serious offenses, possibly insurrection or robbery, as crucifixion was reserved for severe crimes. This detail underscores the innocence of Jesus, who was crucified alongside actual lawbreakers, emphasizing His role as the sinless sacrifice.<p><b>were also led away</b><br>The phrase "led away" suggests a procession, a common practice in Roman executions where the condemned were paraded through public streets to serve as a deterrent. This public spectacle was intended to shame the condemned and demonstrate Roman authority. The act of being "led away" also parallels the imagery of a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, further typifying Jesus as the Lamb of God.<p><b>to be executed</b><br>Execution by crucifixion was a brutal and humiliating form of capital punishment used by the Romans. It was designed to prolong suffering and serve as a public warning. The method of execution fulfills the curse described in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, "cursed is anyone who is hung on a tree," which Paul later references in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> to explain how Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.<p><b>with Jesus</b><br>The phrase "with Jesus" signifies His association with sinners, a theme consistent throughout His ministry. Jesus' crucifixion between two criminals symbolizes His mission to save the lost and His identification with humanity's sinfulness. This positioning also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the suffering of the righteous amidst evildoers.
