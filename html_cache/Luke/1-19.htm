Gabriel's name means "God is my strength." He is often associated with delivering important messages from God, as seen in the Book of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16, 9</a>:21) where he explains visions to Daniel. His appearance here signifies the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>replied the angel.</b><br>Angels are spiritual beings created by God, often serving as messengers. In the biblical context, angels are depicted as powerful and holy, acting as intermediaries between God and humans. The presence of an angel indicates a divine intervention or revelation.<p><b>I stand in the presence of God,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Gabriel's authority and the significance of his message. Standing in the presence of God implies a position of honor and direct access to divine will. It underscores the heavenly origin of the message and the trustworthiness of the messenger.<p><b>and I have been sent to speak to you</b><br>Gabriel's mission is divinely ordained, highlighting the personal nature of God's communication with humanity. This reflects the biblical theme of God reaching out to individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the callings of prophets like Moses (Exodus 3) and Isaiah (Isaiah 6).<p><b>and to bring you this good news.</b><br>The term "good news" is synonymous with the Gospel, which means "good news" in Greek. This message foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate Good News for humanity. The announcement of John the Baptist's birth, which Gabriel is delivering, is a precursor to the coming of Christ, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gabriel.htm">Gabriel</a></b><br>An archangel who stands in the presence of God.

As having appeared in the prophecies which, more than any others, were the germ of the Messianic expectations which the people cherished, there was a fitness in the mission now given to Gabriel to prepare the way for the Messiah's coming.<p><span class= "bld">That stand in the presence of God.</span>--The imagery was drawn from the customs of an Eastern Court, in which those stood who were the most honoured ministers of the king, while others fell prostrate in silent homage.

The meaning of the name Gabriel is "Hero of God," or "Mighty One of God." In the canonical books only two of the heavenly ones are mentioned by name. Gabriel (here and <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a> and Daniel 9:21) and Michael, which signifies "Who is like God" (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>; and in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 21</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). Of these two blessed spirits whose names are revealed to us in the Word of God, their appointed work seems to be in connection with the human race and its enemies. Gabriel is the special messenger of good news. He comes to Daniel, and tells him of the restoration of Jerusalem; to Zacharias, and announces the birth of his son, and declares what his glorious office would consist in; to Mary of Nazareth, and foretells the nativity. Michael, on the other hand, appears as the warrior of God. In the Book of Daniel he wars with the enemies of the people of the Lord; in Jude and in the Revelation of St. John he is the victorious antagonist of Satan the enemy of the Eternal. The Jews have a striking saying that Gabriel flies with two wings, but Michael with only one; so God is swift in sending angels of peace and of joy, of which blessed company the archangel Gabriel is the representative, while the messengers of his wrath and punishment, among whom Michael holds a chief place, come slowly. <span class="cmt_word">That stand in the presence of God</span>. <p><span class="accented">"One of the seven<br />Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,<br />Stand ready at command, and are his eyes<br />That run through all the heavens, and down to the earth<br />Bear his swift commands, over moist and dry,<br />O'er sea and land."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Paradise Lost,' 3. 650.</span>) Milton derived his knowledge of the seven from the apocryphal Book of Tobit, where in chapter 12:15 we read, "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." In the very ancient Book of Enoch we read of the names of the four great archangels, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#947;&#974;</span> <span class="translit">(Eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
