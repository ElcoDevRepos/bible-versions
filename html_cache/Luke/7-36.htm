It links back to His healing of the centurion&#8217;s servant and raising the widow&#8217;s son (<a href="/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1&#8211;17</a>), and His dialogue about John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/7-18.htm">Luke 7:18&#8211;35</a>). Scripture shows Jesus constantly moving from one intentional encounter to the next&#8212;just as He went &#8220;immediately&#8221; to Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41&#8211;42</a>) and &#8220;went out again&#8221; to teach (<a href="/mark/2-13.htm">Mark 2:13</a>).

This unnamed Pharisee represents that mixed response. Luke later identifies him as &#8220;Simon&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-40.htm">Luke 7:40</a>), reminding us that individuals&#8212;regardless of group labels&#8212;must personally reckon with Jesus, just as Saul the Pharisee would on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Invited Jesus</b><p>An invitation implies a measure of respect. Jesus consistently accepted such invitations, whether from tax collectors (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29</a>) or other Pharisees (<a href="/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1</a>). <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> pictures Him still ready to &#8220;come in and dine&#8221; with any who open the door.

Of such St. John tells us (<a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>) there were many among the chief rulers. We find another example of the same kind in <a href="/luke/11-37.htm" title="And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee sought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.">Luke 11:37</a>. Looking to the connection in which the narrative stands, it seems probable that the man was moved by the words that had just been spoken to show that he, at least, was among "the children of wisdom," and did not take up the reproach--"a gluttonous man and a winebibber." There is something very suggestive in our Lord's accepting the invitation. He did not seek such feasts, but neither would He refuse them, for there too there might be an opening for doing His Father's work.<p><span class= "bld">And sat down to meat.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">He lay down</span> This was the usual position in the East (see Note on <a href="/matthew/26-20.htm" title="Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.">Matthew 26:20</a>), and in this case we have to remember it in order to understand the narrative. We learn from <a href="/luke/7-49.htm" title="And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?">Luke 7:49</a> that there were other guests present. The Pharisee had probably invited his "friends and rich neighbours," and thought that he conferred an honour on the Prophet of Nazareth by asking Him to meet them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-50.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">nameless woman who was a sinner</span>, <span class="accented">and Simon the-Pharisee.</span> As regards the incident about to be told, some commentators have believed that the anointing was identical with that related by St. John as having taken place at Bethany very shortly before the Crucifixion. Without detailing the several points of difference in the two recitals, it will be sufficient surely to call attention to the character of the Bethany family, Lazarus and his sisters, the intimate friends of Jesus, to show how monstrous it would be to attempt to connect the poor soul who followed the Master to Simon's house with the sweet Mary of Bethany. A widely spread and, in the Western Church, a very generally received tradition identifies this woman with Mary of Magdala - the Mary Magdalene mentioned in <a href="/luke/9-2.htm">Luke 9:2</a>, and again after the Crucifixion, in company with the band of holy women (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10</a>). Out of Mary Magdalene, we learn, had been cast seven devils. This, however, gives us no clue to identify the two; rather the contrary. It is scarcely likely that the apparently well-known courtesan of the touching story was a demoniac. The earliest writers say nothing respecting the identity of the two. Gregory the Great, however, stamped the theory with his direct assertion, and that the Western Church generally accepted the identification of the two is clear from the selection of this narrative of St. Luke as the portion of Scripture appointed for the Gospel for the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene (this was one of the feasts omitted by the English Reformers from the calendar of the Prayer-book of 1552). It is impossible to decide the question positively. One modern commentator of distinction quaintly pleads for Gregory the Great's rather arbitrary theory, by suggesting that there is no sufficient reason to disturb the ancient Christian belief which has been consecrated in so many glorious works of art; but, in spite of this, the opinion which considers "the woman which was a sinner" the same person as "the Magdalene," is really based on Little else than on a mediaeval tradition. St. Luke alone relates this touching story. We can conceive the joy of Paul when this "memory of the Master" came across him. It so admirably illustrates what this great teacher felt was his Master's mind on the all-important subject - <span class="accented">the freeness and universality of salvation.</span> It seems likely enough <span class="accented">that</span> Dean Plumptre's interesting conjecture respecting this scene in the Pharisee Simon's house is correct. "Occurring, as the narrative does, in St. Luke only, it is probable enough that the 'woman which was a sinner' became known to the company of devout women named in the following chapter (<a href="/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1-3</a>), and that the evangelist derived his knowledge of the fact from them. His reticence - probably their reticence - as to the name was, under the circumstances, at once natural and considerate." No special note of time or of the locality is appended. If this <span class="accented">sinner</span> was one and the same with the <span class="accented">Magdalene</span>, then the city implied is certainly Magdala, the modern mud village of <span class="accented">El-Mejdel</span>, but at that time a populous wealthy town on the Lake of Galilee. If, as we believe, the two were not identical, the city is most probably Capernaum, the usual residence of our Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house</span>. Up to this period the relations between our Lord and the dominant parties in the capital had not reached a state of positive hostility. The Pharisees, as the chief among these parties in the state, had taken the initiative, and were sharply watching One whose influence among the people they more than suspected was hostile to them. But they had not as yet declared him a public enemy and blasphemer. This wealthy Pharisee, Simon, was evidently, like others of his sect at this time, Wavering in his estimate of Jesus. On the one hand, he was naturally influenced by the hostile views entertained at head-quarters concerning the Galilaean Teacher; on the other, personal intercourse with the Master, the acts he had witnessed, and the words he had heard, disposed him to a reverential admiration. Simon evidently (ver. 39) had not made up his mind whether or not Jesus was a Prophet. His soul, too - this we gather from ver. 42 - had received some great spiritual good from his intercourse with the Master. But though he invited him to be a guest at his house, and evidently loved him (ver. 47) a little, still he received his Divine Guest with but a chilling and coldly courteous reception. Not unlikely Simon the Pharisee knew he was watched that day, and that among his guests were men who would report every action of his on that occasion to the leaders of his party in Jerusalem.
