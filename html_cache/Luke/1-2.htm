The early Christian community placed a high value on preserving the teachings and events of Jesus' life accurately. The oral tradition was a common method of preserving history in ancient times, especially in Jewish culture, where stories and teachings were passed down through generations. This phrase assures readers of the reliability of the Gospel account, as it was carefully handed down from those who directly witnessed the events.<p><b>by the initial eyewitnesses</b><br>The term "eyewitnesses" underscores the credibility of the Gospel narrative. In the context of the New Testament, eyewitnesses were those who had directly seen and heard Jesus during His ministry. This includes the apostles and other disciples who were present during key events such as the miracles, crucifixion, and resurrection. The importance of eyewitness testimony is also highlighted in other scriptures, such as 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a> and <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>, which stress the firsthand experience of the apostles in proclaiming the truth about Jesus.<p><b>and servants of the word</b><br>This phrase refers to those who were dedicated to spreading the teachings of Jesus. The "word" here is understood as the message of the Gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ. The term "servants" indicates a role of humility and dedication, suggesting that these individuals were committed to faithfully transmitting the teachings they received. This aligns with the role of the apostles and early church leaders, who were tasked with teaching and preserving the doctrine of Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>.

The gospel message did not originate with him; it was relayed &#8220;just as&#8221; it had already been preserved.<p>&#8226; Reliability is in view. Luke treats the tradition as something complete and unchanged, echoing passages like <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> (&#8220;Your word, O LORD, stands forever&#8221;) and Jude 3 (&#8220;the faith once for all delivered to the saints&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Handing down implies intentional transmission, not casual rumor. Paul uses the same idea in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a> when he says, &#8220;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wording underscores God&#8217;s providence: the same Lord who gave the message superintends its passage through time (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To us</b><p>The good news has moved from the apostles&#8217; generation to Luke&#8217;s and now to ours.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Us&#8221; first means Luke and his contemporaries, including Theophilus (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>), but by extension every reader today (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture speaks directly to modern believers; its authority is not diminished by distance (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal tone invites ownership: the gospel is not merely ancient data but living truth meant for everyday life (<a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By the initial eyewitnesses</b><p>The bedrock of the gospel is firsthand testimony.<p>&#8226; Eyewitnesses saw Jesus&#8217; miracles, death, and resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>; <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Their coordinated witness rules out myth or legend (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Because these men and women staked their lives on what they saw, we can have full confidence in the narrative (<a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And servants of the word</b><p>Those eyewitnesses were more than observers; they became ministers who proclaimed and preserved the message.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;servants of the word&#8221; highlights humble submission to God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It also points to Spirit-empowered mission (<a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their service included teaching, writing, and mentoring others, creating a chain of faith (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a> assures us that the gospel we hold is the very account first seen and heard by Christ&#8217;s original followers and faithfully passed down by dedicated servants.

The general accuracy of the recitals contained in those early Gospels is here conceded, as the source of these primitive writings was the tradition delivered by the eye-witnesses of the acts of Jesus; among these eye-witnesses the apostles would, of course, hold the foremost place. The whole statement may be roughly paraphrased thus: "The narrative of the memorable events which have been accomplished in our midst many have undertaken to compose. These different narratives are in strict conformity with the apostles' tradition, which men who were themselves eye-witnesses of the great events, and subsequently ministers of the Word, handed down to us. Now, I have traced up all these traditions anew to their very sources, and propose rewriting them in consecutive order, that you, my lord Theophilus, may be fully convinced of the positive certainty of those great truths in which you have been instructed." Eye-witnesses, anal ministers of the Word; witnesses of the events of the public ministry of Jesus, from the baptism to the Ascension. These men, in great numbers, after Pentecost, became ministers and preachers of the Word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
