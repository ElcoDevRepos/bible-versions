Jerusalem is significant as the location of the Temple, where Jewish worship and sacrifices were conducted. Simeon's presence in Jerusalem places him at the heart of Jewish religious activity. His name, Simeon, is a common Jewish name, meaning "he has heard," which may imply his attentiveness to God's promises.<p><b>who was righteous and devout</b><br>Simeon is described as righteous and devout, indicating his adherence to the Law of Moses and his piety in religious practices. Righteousness in the biblical sense often refers to living in accordance with God's commandments, while devoutness suggests a deep commitment to worship and prayer. This characterization aligns Simeon with other biblical figures who are commended for their faithfulness, such as Noah and Abraham.<p><b>He was waiting for the consolation of Israel</b><br>The "consolation of Israel" refers to the anticipated comfort and redemption that the Messiah would bring to the Jewish people. This expectation is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah, which speak of a coming deliverer who would restore Israel. Simeon's waiting reflects the hope and longing of many Jews of his time for the fulfillment of these messianic prophecies.<p><b>and the Holy Spirit was upon him</b><br>The presence of the Holy Spirit upon Simeon indicates divine favor and guidance. In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit would come upon individuals to empower them for specific tasks or to deliver messages from God. This phrase suggests that Simeon was under the influence of the Holy Spirit, enabling him to recognize the significance of Jesus' arrival. The Holy Spirit's role here foreshadows the more widespread outpouring of the Spirit in the New Testament, particularly at Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>A righteous and devout man in Jerusalem, known for his piety and anticipation of the Messiah.

His example calls us to live righteously, wait expectantly, and walk daily in the Spirit, confident that every promise of God will come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Whose name was Simeon.</span>--Some writers have identified the man thus described with a very memorable Simeon in the annals of the Jewish scribes, the son of Hillel, and the father of Gamaliel. He became president of the Sanhedrin, A.D. 13. Singularly enough, the Mishna, the great collection of expositions of the Law by the leading Rabbis, passes over his name altogether, and this suggests the thought that it may have done so because he was under a cloud, as believing in the prophet of Nazareth. On this assumption, his looking for the "consolation of Israel" may be connected on one side with the fact that he, too, was of the house of David, and on the other, with the cautious counsel of Gamaliel in <a href="/context/acts/5-38.htm" title="And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:">Acts 5:38-39</a>. Against this view there is the fact that St. Luke's way of speaking leaves the impression that the Simeon of whom he speaks was of a very advanced age, waiting for his departure, and that he, who names Gamaliel's position (<a href="/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;">Acts 5:34</a>), would hardly have passed over Simeon's. There was an aged Essene of this name living at the time of Herod's death, who rebuked Archelaus for marrying his brother's widow, and prophesied his downfall, and who more nearly fulfils the conditions; but the name was so common that all conjectures are very precarious.<p><span class= "bld">Devout.</span>--The Greek word expresses the cautious, scrupulous side of the religious life, and is therefore used always in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>; <a href="/acts/22-12.htm" title="And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,">Acts 22:12</a>) of Jewish devoutness. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-35.</span> - <span class="accented">The episode of Simeon and his inspired hymn</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him</span>. Many expositors have believed that this Simeon was identical with Simeon (Shimeon) the son of the famous Hillel, and the father of Gamaliel. This Simeon became president of the Sanhedrin in A.D. . Strangely enough, the Mishna, which preserves a record of the sayings and works of the great rabbis, passes by this Simeon. The curious silence of the Mishna here was, perhaps, owing to the hatred which this famous teacher incurred because of his belief in Jesus of Nazareth. Such an identification, although interesting, is, however, very precarious, the name Simeon being so very common among the people. Waiting for the consolation of Israel. There was a general feeling among the more earnest Jews at this time that the advent of Messiah would not be long delayed. Joseph of Arimathaea is especially mentioned as one who "waited for the kingdom of God" (<a href="/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>). Dr. Farrar refers to the common Jewish prayer-formula then ill use: "May I see the consolation of Israel!" A prayer for the advent of Messiah was in daily use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
