In the cultural context of the time, giving was not only a religious duty but also a social expectation. The act of giving is seen as a reflection of one's faith and trust in God's provision. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, which states, "A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." The idea is that God rewards those who are generous with their resources, whether material or spiritual.<p><b>A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over</b><br>This imagery comes from the marketplace practices of the time, where grains or other commodities were measured. A "good measure" refers to a full and honest measure, while "pressed down, shaken together, and running over" describes the process of ensuring the container is filled to its maximum capacity. This phrase suggests abundance and overflowing blessings, indicating that God's rewards for generosity are not just adequate but abundant. It reflects the nature of God's grace, which is lavish and overflowing.<p><b>will be poured into your lap.</b><br>In ancient times, people wore long robes with a fold or pouch in the front, which could be used to carry items. The image of something being poured into one's lap signifies receiving an abundance that is more than one can hold. This phrase underscores the personal and direct nature of God's blessings, suggesting that they will be evident and tangible in one's life.<p><b>For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reinforces the principle of reciprocity and fairness. It implies that the standard one uses in giving will be the standard used in receiving. This concept is consistent with the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." It serves as a reminder of the moral and spiritual law that governs generosity and the consequences of one's actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon that includes teachings on love, mercy, and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, including this verse, which is part of the Sermon on the Plain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>A significant teaching moment in the Gospel of Luke where Jesus addresses a large crowd, offering guidance on living a life that reflects God's kingdom values.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_generosity.htm">Principle of Generosity</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that giving is not just a command but a principle that brings blessings.
