The number eighteen is significant as it highlights the personal and tragic nature of the event, emphasizing that these were real individuals with families and lives. The mention of a specific number underscores the gravity of the incident and invites reflection on the unpredictability of life and death.<p><b>when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them:</b><br>The tower of Siloam was likely part of the fortifications near the Pool of Siloam in Jerusalem. This pool was an important site for water storage and ritual purification. The collapse of the tower may have been due to construction flaws or natural causes, but it serves as a reminder of human vulnerability. The Pool of Siloam is also significant in the New Testament, as Jesus later heals a blind man there (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>), symbolizing spiritual enlightenment and salvation.<p><b>Do you think that they were more sinful</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the common belief that personal tragedy is a direct result of personal sin. In the cultural context of the time, many believed that suffering was a punishment for sin. Jesus refutes this notion, teaching that disasters are not necessarily divine retribution. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God's ways and judgments are beyond human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>than all the others living in Jerusalem?</b><br>Jerusalem, as the religious and cultural center of Jewish life, was home to many who considered themselves righteous. By comparing the victims to "all the others living in Jerusalem," Jesus emphasizes that no one is inherently more deserving of tragedy than another. This statement calls for self-examination and repentance, urging listeners to focus on their own spiritual state rather than judging others. It echoes the biblical call to humility and repentance found throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eighteen_victims.htm">The Eighteen Victims</a></b><br>These were individuals who perished when the tower in Siloam collapsed.

It was clearly one that had impressed the minds of men with horror, as a special judgment. At or near to Siloam, the modern <span class= "ital">Birket-Silwan,</span> is a swimming-pool, or tank (<a href="/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>), where the valley of Tyrop?on opens into that of the Kedron. It was supplied through artificial conduits, and appears to have been one of a series of pools so fed. It is not unlikely, connected as Siloam thus was with the water-system of the city, that the tower in question was part of the works which Pilate had planned, and partly executed, for the construction of an aqueduct, and for which he appropriated part of the Corban or sacred treasure of the Temple, and if so, the popular excitement which this measure caused (see Note on <a href="/matthew/27-2.htm" title="And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.">Matthew 27:2</a>) might well lead men to look on its fall as an instance of a divine judgment on what they regarded as an act of sacrilege.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?</span> "You remember," goes on the Master, "the catastrophe of the fall of the tower in Siloam; the poor sufferers who were crushed there were not specially wicked men." The Lord used these occasions, we see, for something more than the great national lesson. Men are too ready, now as then, to give way to the unloving error of looking at individual misfortune as the consequence of individual crime. Such human uncharitable judgments the Lord bitterly condemns. Ewald's conjecture in connection with this Siloam accident is ingenious. He supposes that the rigid Jews looked on the catastrophe as a retribution because the workmen who perished were paid by Pilate out of the sacred corban money (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 4). The works were no doubt in connection with the aqueduct to the Pool of Siloam. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7970;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
