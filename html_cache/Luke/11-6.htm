Travelers often relied on the generosity of others for food and lodging, as inns were scarce and often unsafe. The arrival of a friend from a journey would have been a moment of honor and duty for the host. This reflects the biblical principle of hospitality seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>, where Abraham welcomes three visitors. The journey motif is also significant in Scripture, symbolizing spiritual pilgrimage or life's journey, as seen in the Israelites' exodus or Jesus' own travels during His ministry.<p><b>and I have nothing to set before him.</b><br>The host's lack of provisions highlights the urgency and desperation of the situation. In a culture where honor and shame were pivotal, failing to provide for a guest would bring disgrace. This phrase underscores human insufficiency and the need for divine provision, echoing themes found in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>) where Jesus provides abundantly. It also points to the spiritual truth that humanity, in its fallen state, has nothing to offer God and must rely on His grace and provision, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_friend.htm">The Friend</a></b><br>This refers to the person who arrives unexpectedly at the host's house after a journey.
