Despite being surrounded by a crowd, He pauses, demonstrating His willingness to address individual needs. This act reflects His nature as the Good Shepherd who cares for each of His sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>). It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who will not ignore the cries of the needy.<p><b>and directed that the man be brought to Him.</b><br>Jesus' directive to bring the man to Him shows His authority and intentionality. In the cultural context, a blind beggar would have been marginalized, yet Jesus elevates his status by calling him forward. This act parallels the invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, where Jesus calls all who are weary to come to Him. It also prefigures the inclusivity of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>, where God shows no favoritism.<p><b>When he had come near,</b><br>The movement of the blind man towards Jesus signifies faith and obedience. In biblical terms, drawing near to God is often associated with seeking His presence and favor (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). This approach is symbolic of the spiritual journey of coming to Christ, as seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), where the son returns to the father.<p><b>Jesus asked him,</b><br>Jesus' question is not due to ignorance but serves to engage the man personally and to elicit a confession of faith. This method of questioning is consistent with God's interactions throughout Scripture, such as when God asked Adam, "Where are you?" (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>). It invites reflection and a declaration of need, setting the stage for a miraculous encounter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

He commands the obstacle-creating crowd to become a conduit of grace, draws the seeker near, and invites a heartfelt request. The verse showcases Christ&#8217;s compassion, authority, and desire for personal interaction. It assures us that when we call on Him in faith, He stops, summons us closer, and listens, ready to meet our deepest need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 40, 41.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him.</span> St. Mark here adds, "And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee."
