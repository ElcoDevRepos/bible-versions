Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly intervened to assist Israel, from the Exodus (Exodus 14) to the return from Babylonian exile (Ezra 1). The term "servant" underscores Israel's role in God's plan, as seen in Isaiah's Servant Songs (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-9</a>). This assistance is not just historical but also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate help through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to Israel (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<p><b>remembering to be merciful</b><br>God's mercy is a central theme in Scripture, reflecting His covenantal faithfulness. The Hebrew concept of "hesed" (loving-kindness or steadfast love) is often associated with God's mercy (Psalm 136). This mercy is not earned but is a reflection of God's character and His promises to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, with Jesus embodying God's mercy through His life, death, and resurrection (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>). This phrase also connects to the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>), where Mary praises God's mercy, linking the past acts of God with the present and future fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>- The mother of Jesus, who is speaking these words as part of her Magnificat, a song of praise to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation chosen by God, often referred to as His servant, representing the collective people of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The one who has shown mercy and help to Israel, fulfilling His promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_magnificat.htm">The Magnificat</a></b><br>- The song of praise spoken by Mary, found in <a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>, expressing joy and gratitude for God's faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>- The promises made by God to Abraham and his descendants, which are being fulfilled through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God consistently remembers His promises and acts in accordance with His covenant.

His promises are as sure as completed facts (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The help centers on salvation in Christ.

Mary&#8217;s words confirm that the Lord is fulfilling His ancient plan through the Jewish Messiah (<a href="/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal tone&#8212;&#8220;His servant&#8221;&#8212;underscores ownership.

Now we find that all the soul of the maiden of Nazareth is with her people. Her joy in the "great things "which God has done for her rests on the fact that they are "great things "for Israel also. The word which she uses for her people is that which expresses their relation to God as "the servant" of Jehovah, who is prominent in the later chapters of Isaiah, and is in <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a> identified with the nation, as elsewhere with the nation's Head (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>). One may see in the utterance of this hope already seen as realised, an indication of the early date of the hymn. At the time when St. Luke wrote, the rejection, not the restoration of Israel, was the dominant thought in men's minds.<p><span class= "bld">In remembrance.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in order to remember.</span> He helped Israel, as with the purpose to prove Himself not unmindful of His promised mercy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 54, 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; as he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</span> Her hymn dies down into a strain of gratitude for the eternal faithfulness to the cause of the chosen people.
