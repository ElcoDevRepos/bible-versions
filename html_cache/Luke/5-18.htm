The men carrying the paralyzed man demonstrate faith and determination, qualities that are central to the narrative. In Jewish culture, physical ailments were often seen as a result of sin, yet these men believed in Jesus' power to heal. The mat, a simple bedroll, indicates the man's poverty and helplessness, emphasizing his need for divine intervention. This act of carrying the man reflects the communal responsibility and compassion encouraged in the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which commands love for one's neighbor.<p><b>They tried to bring him inside to set him before Jesus,</b><br>The attempt to bring the man inside highlights the crowded conditions often surrounding Jesus due to His growing reputation as a healer and teacher. This scene underscores the barriers&#8212;both physical and societal&#8212;that people faced in seeking Jesus. The determination to set the man before Jesus illustrates the belief in His authority and willingness to heal, echoing the faith of the centurion in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>. This act of faith is reminiscent of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bringing healing and restoration.

And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into</span> <span class="cmt_word">the midst before Jesus.</span> So far there was nothing very unusual in the incident. These healings must have been of common occurrence with our Lord. The poor sufferer and his friends, intensely anxious for an interview with One whom they justly regarded as the great Physician, were rightly confident that they had but to see the Master, to state their case, and to receive the blessing which they sought. On this occasion it seemed impossible to get at the merciful Healer. Now or never, they thought. He might, as he had done before, withdraw himself. The chance might never recur. So they accomplished their purpose in the way narrated by the evangelist. It was evidently nothing very extraordinary - an ingenious device, nothing more; only by it the friends of the sufferer showed that they were intensely in earnest, that they were confident that the Master had both the power and the will to do what they wanted, Much has been written on the device employed on this occasion by the friends of the paralytic. Delitzsch, in his 'A Day at Capernaum,' graphically describes what must have taken place. Two bearers ascend the roof by a ladder, and by means of cords they draw up by the same way the sick man after them, assisted by two other bearers. In the middle of the terrace was a square place, open in summer to give light and air to the house, but closed with tiles during the rainy season. Having opened this passage, the bearers let down the sick man into the large inner court immediately below, where Jesus was teaching, near the cistern fixed as usual in this court. The trap-stairs, which led down from the terrace into the court, would have been too narrow for their use, and would not have taken them into the court, but into the apartments which overlooked it from all sides. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Just then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[some] men</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(andres)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
