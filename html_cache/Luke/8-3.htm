Her association with Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, suggests she had access to the upper echelons of society. Her husband, Chuza, managed Herod's household, indicating a position of significant responsibility and trust. This connection to Herod's court underscores the reach of Jesus' ministry, even into influential circles. Joanna's involvement demonstrates the breaking of social barriers, as women were not typically recognized as disciples in Jewish culture. Her presence fulfills the prophecy of the inclusive nature of the Messiah's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>, which speaks of good news for all people.<p><b>Susanna</b><br>Susanna is another woman mentioned among Jesus' followers, though little else is known about her from the biblical text. Her inclusion signifies the important role women played in Jesus' ministry. The mention of her name, despite the lack of additional details, suggests her contribution was significant enough to be remembered by the early Christian community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using individuals from all walks of life to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of other lesser-known figures like Jabez (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">1 Chronicles 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>and many others</b><br>The phrase "and many others" indicates that a substantial number of women supported Jesus' ministry. This highlights the communal and inclusive nature of His mission. The presence of many women followers challenges the cultural norms of the time, where women were often marginalized. It also reflects the early church's recognition of the vital contributions of women, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles, where women like Lydia (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>) played key roles in the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>These women were ministering to them out of their own means</b><br>The women provided for Jesus and His disciples from their own resources, demonstrating their commitment and sacrifice. This act of service is significant, as it shows their deep faith and dedication to Jesus' mission. In a cultural context where women had limited economic power, their ability to support the ministry financially indicates they were likely women of means or had control over their resources. This mirrors the biblical principle of stewardship and generosity, as seen in the widow's offering (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>), where giving is measured by the heart and sacrifice rather than the amount. Their support also fulfills the principle of mutual care within the body of Christ, as later articulated by Paul in <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joanna.htm">Joanna</a></b><br>The wife of Chuza, who was the manager of Herod's household.

Nothing further is known of Chuza--but the "steward" (the same word as in <a href="/matthew/20-8.htm" title="So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.">Matthew 20:8</a>, and the "tutor" or "guardian" of <a href="/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a>) of the Tetrarch, the manager of his income and expenditure, must have been a man of some mark. We may think of him and his wife as having probably come under the influence of the Baptist or of Manaen, the foster-brother of the Tetrarch, probably also of one of the "servants" to whom Antipas imparted his belief that John the Baptist was risen from the dead. Joanna appears again in the history of the Resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>).
