Despite its proximity to Jesus' ministry, it is mentioned only in this context of rebuke. The term "woe" is a strong expression of lament and judgment, indicating the seriousness of their unrepentance. This reflects the biblical principle that greater revelation brings greater responsibility (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><b>Woe to you, Bethsaida!</b><br>Bethsaida was another town near the Sea of Galilee, known as the hometown of several apostles, including Peter, Andrew, and Philip. Jesus performed miracles here, such as the healing of a blind man (<a href="/mark/8-22.htm">Mark 8:22-26</a>). The repetition of "woe" emphasizes the gravity of their failure to respond to Jesus' works and message.<p><b>For if the miracles that were performed in you</b><br>The miracles refer to the signs and wonders Jesus performed, which were meant to authenticate His divine authority and message. These acts were not just displays of power but were intended to lead people to repentance and faith.<p><b>had been performed in Tyre and Sidon,</b><br>Tyre and Sidon were ancient Phoenician cities known for their wealth and paganism. In the Old Testament, they were often condemned by prophets for their idolatry and arrogance (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2-8</a>). Jesus' comparison suggests that even these historically sinful cities would have responded more favorably to His miracles than Chorazin and Bethsaida did.<p><b>they would have repented long ago,</b><br>Repentance involves a change of mind and heart, turning away from sin and toward God. The statement underscores the hardness of heart in Chorazin and Bethsaida, as even notoriously sinful cities like Tyre and Sidon would have repented if given the same opportunity.<p><b>sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</b><br>Sackcloth and ashes were traditional symbols of mourning and repentance in Jewish culture (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). This imagery conveys deep sorrow for sin and a desire for forgiveness. The use of these symbols highlights the expected response to Jesus' message and miracles, contrasting with the actual response of Chorazin and Bethsaida.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chorazin.htm">Chorazin</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles.

Jesus&#8217; mighty works in Chorazin and Bethsaida verified His identity, but the towns&#8217; indifference provoked divine &#8220;woes.&#8221; By contrasting them with Tyre and Sidon, the Lord teaches that judgment is proportional to light received. External exposure to miracles is no substitute for inward repentance marked by humility&#8212;symbolized by sackcloth and ashes. Every hearer today, equally accountable to revealed truth, is urged to respond with genuine, life-changing faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13-16) <span class= "bld">Woe unto thee, Chorazin!</span>--See Notes on <a href="/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>, where the words appear as spoken at an earlier period. We have again to choose between the two alternative views, (1) that the words were spoken but once, and floated in men's memories without any very definite note of time or place, and were wrongly placed by one, or, possibly, by both Evangelists; or (2) that they were repeated on different occasions. The latter seems, on the whole, by far the more probable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ashes.</span> In St. Matthew's Gospel (Matthew 11:20), where the woe of the fair lake-cities is announced in similar language, the "woe" is introduced with the words," Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done." Now, we have no record of any miracles having been worked at Chorazin, the first mentioned. But these cities were in the immediate vicinity of Capernaum, where for a length-cued period our Lord principally resided. He was, no doubt, during the Galilaean ministry, constantly in one or other of those bright, busy cities built on the shores of the Lake of Gennesaret. This bears out St. John's statement (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30</a>) concerning the many unrecorded miracles of Christ, and gives us some notion of the numerous events in the life left without mention; much must have happened in Choraziu to have called forth this stern saying. Late research thinks it probable that the site of Chorazin has been discovered near Capernaum; the ruins, however, at a little distance, look but a mere rough heap of stones. A great theological truth is urged in this saying of the Master. Men will be judged not only for what they have done or failed to do, but their opportunities, their circumstances, their chances in life, will be, before they are judged, strictly taken into account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
