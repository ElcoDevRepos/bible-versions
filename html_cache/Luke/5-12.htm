The towns in Galilee were small, often with populations of a few hundred to a few thousand. Jesus' presence in these towns fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee. His ministry in these areas demonstrates His accessibility and willingness to reach ordinary people.<p><b>a man came along who was covered with leprosy</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times referred to various skin diseases, not just Hansen's disease. It rendered individuals ceremonially unclean, isolating them from society (Leviticus 13-14). This man's condition was severe, as indicated by being "covered" with leprosy, suggesting a desperate situation. Leprosy is often seen as a type of sin, symbolizing its pervasive and isolating nature.<p><b>When he saw Jesus, he fell facedown and begged Him</b><br>The man's actions show deep reverence and desperation. Falling facedown is a posture of worship and submission, indicating recognition of Jesus' authority and power. This act of humility is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals recognize divine presence (e.g., <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&#8221;</b><br>Addressing Jesus as "Lord" acknowledges His divine authority. The man's statement reflects faith in Jesus' ability to heal, yet submits to His will, showing trust in Jesus' goodness and sovereignty. This mirrors the faith seen in other healing accounts, such as the centurion's servant (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>). The request for cleansing, rather than healing, highlights the desire for restoration to community and worship, as leprosy also had religious implications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, known for His healing and teaching ministry.

The certain city was probably the town of <span class="accented">Hattim</span>, for we read in St. Matthew that the famous cure took place as the Lord was coming down from the mount of Beatitudes. (This will be spoken of in its place in ch. 6.) <span class="cmt_word">Behold a man full of leprosy</span>. The expression "behold" reproduces exactly the scene as the eye-witness remembered it. There were many apparently with the Master on that occasion; but following him, suddenly, as he went on before the crowd, one of those ghastly victims of the frightful disease stood before him, apparently having eluded observation, for they were not allowed to appear in the ordinary haunts of men. The unhappy man fell down and knelt before the great Physician, of whom he may have heard so much, and asks him to exercise his mighty power on the dread malady which was eating away his life. The leper evidently had no doubt whatever of the <span class="accented">power</span> of Jesus; he was only anxious as to whether he had the <span class="accented">will to</span> cure him. The whole question respecting the exact nature of the disease is a vexed one. The word has been used with varying extent of meaning. As far as we can gather, the disease in its worst form seems to have been a progressive decay arising from the poisoning of the blood. The face and different members of the body were attacked and gradually destroyed, till the sufferer became a hideous spectacle, and literally fell to pieces. It is much disputed whether or not the malady in any of its varied developments and stages was contagious. The strict separation which in well-nigh all forms of the disease was rigidly insisted on would seem at all events to point to the conclusion that, in the popular estimation, it certainly was so; some phases of the malady, however, appear to have been considered as perfectly free from contagious effect - for instance, Naaman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a leper. It is hot conceivable that one who was infected with so grave a malady, considered incurable, would, if contagious, have been permitted to have exercised a function which would have brought him into constant contact with masses of his fellow-countrymen. These cases, however, were apparently few in number, and those afflicted with what was usually called leprosy were rigidly separated from their fellows, not only to dwell apart, but positively forbidden to approach the dwellings of men. In the Egyptian legends of the Exodus, the Israelites were said to have been expelled <span class="accented">because they were lepers.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
