The number ten often signifies completeness or responsibility in biblical numerology. This calling of the servants can be seen as a representation of Jesus calling His disciples and, by extension, all believers to serve Him. The act of calling indicates a personal relationship and a specific purpose, reflecting the calling of the disciples in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>).<p><b>and gave them ten minas.</b><br>A mina was a unit of currency in the ancient world, equivalent to about three months' wages. The giving of minas signifies the entrusting of resources or responsibilities to the servants. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual gifts, talents, and opportunities God gives to His people. The equal distribution of minas suggests that each servant is given the same initial opportunity, emphasizing fairness and the expectation of stewardship. This parallels the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where servants are also entrusted with resources.<p><b>&#8216;Conduct business with this until I return,&#8217; he said.</b><br>The command to "conduct business" implies active engagement and responsibility. It suggests that the servants are to use what they have been given to produce a return, symbolizing the Christian duty to be fruitful and productive in their spiritual lives. The phrase "until I return" points to the eschatological aspect of the parable, indicating that the nobleman (Jesus) will return, and there will be an accounting. This reflects the Christian belief in the Second Coming of Christ and the final judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.

So far as we lay stress on the difference, it implies that the trust in this case is that which all disciples of Christ have in common--<span class= "ital">viz.,</span> their knowledge of the truth and their membership in the Kingdom, and not the offices and positions that vary in degree. The <span class= "ital">pound,</span> or <span class= "ital">mna,</span> was, in Greek numismatics, not a coin, but a sum equal to the sixtieth part of a talent. The Greek name was probably derived from the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Maneh.</span> According to another estimate it was equal to 25 shekels, or 100 <span class= "ital">drachm??</span> or <span class= "ital">denarii.</span> The word meets us, as far as the New Testament is concerned, in this parable only.<p><span class= "bld">Occupy till I come.</span>--The better MSS. give, "while I am coming." The Greek verb for "occupy" occurs in this passage only in the New Testament. A compound form of it is rendered, in <a href="/luke/19-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.">Luke 19:15</a>, by "gained in trading." The English verb meets us in <a href="/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/27-21.htm" title="Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:21-22</a>, in the sense of "trading," in which it is used here.
