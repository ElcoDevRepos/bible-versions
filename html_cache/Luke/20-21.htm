In the Jewish culture of the time, rabbis were highly respected for their knowledge of the Torah. The inquirers, likely the Pharisees and Herodians, use this title to feign respect, though their intentions are deceitful. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders who often sought to challenge His authority.<p><b>&#8220;we know that You speak and teach correctly.</b><br>This statement is an example of flattery, as the religious leaders attempt to trap Jesus with their question. Despite their insincerity, the acknowledgment that Jesus speaks and teaches correctly is true. Jesus' teachings consistently align with the Scriptures, and He often corrected misunderstandings of the Law. This phrase highlights the recognition of Jesus' authority and wisdom, even by those who opposed Him.<p><b>You show no partiality</b><br>Jesus' impartiality is a significant aspect of His ministry. Unlike many leaders of the time who showed favoritism based on social status or wealth, Jesus treated all individuals equally, whether they were tax collectors, sinners, or religious leaders. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>, where God is described as showing no partiality. Jesus embodies this divine attribute, emphasizing the kingdom of God is open to all.<p><b>but teach the way of God</b><br>The "way of God" refers to the path of righteousness and truth that leads to eternal life. Jesus' teachings consistently pointed to God's will and the coming of His kingdom. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of "the way," which is a metaphor for living according to God's commandments. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus declares Himself as "the way," further solidifying His role as the guide to divine truth.<p><b>in accordance with the truth.</b><br>Truth is a central theme in Jesus' ministry. His teachings are rooted in the truth of God's Word, fulfilling the prophecies and laws of the Old Testament. This phrase underscores the reliability and divine authority of Jesus' message. In <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>, Jesus prays, "Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth," highlighting the connection between God's Word and truth. Jesus' adherence to truth contrasts with the deceitful intentions of His questioners.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being questioned by the religious leaders.

Matthew and Mark both tell us that in this plot the Herodians were united with the Pharisees (and Sanhedrin). The great Nazareth Reformer was equally hateful to both these hostile parties; hence their union in this matter. It was a well and skilfully laid question. This "tribute" was a capitation tax - a denarius a head assessed on the whole population, the publicans who farmed it being answerable for it to the Roman treasury. As a direct personal tax it was most unpopular, and was looked on by scrupulous legalists and the more zealous Jews as involving a greater humiliation than the ordinary import or export customs dues. It occasioned at times popular tumults, as in the case of Judas of Galilee (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>). If Jesus answered the question in the affirmative "Yes, it is lawful for the Jews to give this tribute to Caesar," then the Pharisees would use this decision of his as a means of undermining his credit with the zealous populace. "See, after all," they would say, "this pretended Messiah of yours is but a poor-hearted traitor. <span class="accented">Think of King Messiah paying tribute to a Gentile."</span> If, on the other hand, the Master had said such payment of tribute was unlawful, then the Herodians, who were watching him, hoping for some such expression of opinion, would at once have denounced him to their Roman friends as One who taught the people - only too ready to listen to such teaching - lessons of sedition. In the latter case Pilate and the officials of Rome would have taken good care that the Galilaean Master had troubled the Sanhedrin no more. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Teacher,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Didaskale)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1320.htm">Strong's 1320: </a> </span><span class="str2">A teacher, master.
