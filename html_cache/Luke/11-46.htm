The term "woe" is a strong expression of judgment and lament. The experts in the law were responsible for interpreting the Mosaic Law and were highly respected in Jewish society. However, Jesus criticizes them for their hypocrisy and legalism. This echoes the prophetic tradition found in the Old Testament, where prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah pronounced woes on Israel for similar reasons (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>).<p><b>&#8220;For you weigh men down with heavy burdens,&#8221;</b><br>The "heavy burdens" refer to the numerous and often unnecessary rules and regulations that the experts in the law imposed on the people. These were additional oral traditions and interpretations that went beyond the written Law of Moses. This practice is criticized in other parts of the New Testament, such as <a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>, where Jesus accuses the Pharisees of tying up heavy loads and putting them on men's shoulders. The burdens symbolize the spiritual and moral weight that these leaders placed on the people, making it difficult for them to truly follow God.<p><b>&#8220;but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the hypocrisy and lack of compassion among the religious leaders. While they imposed strict rules on others, they did not assist or provide relief to those struggling under these burdens. This criticism aligns with Jesus' broader teaching on servant leadership, where true leaders are called to serve and help others (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>). The imagery of not lifting a finger suggests a complete lack of effort or willingness to help, contrasting with Jesus' own ministry, where He offers rest to those who are weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, delivering a rebuke to the experts in the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/experts_in_the_law.htm">Experts in the Law (Lawyers)</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for interpreting and teaching the Mosaic Law, criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience witnessing Jesus' rebuke, which includes both His disciples and the general public.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are part of the broader context of Jesus' rebuke in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of many of Jesus' teachings and confrontations with religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_in_leadership.htm">Hypocrisy in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders must practice what they preach.

A &#8220;woe&#8221; is not a casual warning; it is a solemn declaration of judgment (see <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>; <a href="/luke/11-42.htm">Luke 11:42, 44</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>). These scholars prided themselves on precision, yet their scholarship had become a weapon rather than a help. While God&#8217;s law is holy, righteous, and good (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), the men charged with explaining it had turned it into a crushing system of minutiae.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He replied.</b><p>Jesus&#8217; response comes after one lawyer protests, &#8220;Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us as well&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-45.htm">Luke 11:45</a>). His reply shows He will not soften truth to spare professional egos. Like a physician who names the disease so the cure can be applied, He speaks plainly. Compare His bold replies in <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25&#8211;28</a> and <a href="/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43&#8211;45</a>: He consistently answers religious leaders with unvarnished truth when souls are at stake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For you weigh men down with heavy burdens,</b><p>The &#8220;burdens&#8221; are the man-made additions piled on top of God&#8217;s commands&#8212;hundreds of oral regulations governing everything from hand-washing to Sabbath travel. Jesus elsewhere pictures the same scene: &#8220;They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men&#8217;s shoulders&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>). Peter echoes this in <a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>, calling such legalism &#8220;a yoke that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear.&#8221;<p>Helpful contrasts:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s intent: &#8220;His commandments are not burdensome&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; offer: &#8220;My yoke is easy and My burden is light&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit-filled life: &#8220;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load.</b><p>Hypocrisy compounds the sin.

Jesus denounces their hypocrisy because God never intended His law to be a millstone; it was meant to lead people to Him. The verse calls every teacher and believer to ensure we offer the liberating grace of Christ, not man-made weight, remembering that the Savior still invites, &#8220;Come to Me&#8230;and you will find rest for your souls.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">Ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/23-4.htm" title="For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.">Matthew 23:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers</span>. Then the Lord turned to the accomplished Jerusalem scholar, and with withering emphasis pronounced upon his famous and influential order those scathing reproaches which for eighteen centuries have been the woeful inheritance of all hypocritical self-deceivers. How true was the expression, "burdens grievous to be borne," a very superficial study of the Talmud will amply show; for although even the earliest parts of that stupendous compilation were not committed to writing until some time after, yet very much of what we now peruse in those strange, weary treatises existed then in the <span class="accented">oral tradition.</span> which it was the life-work of scholars and pedants, like the lawyer to whom Jesus was then speaking, to learn, to expound, and to amplify; and these vexatious and frivolous ordinances which the lawyers and scribes pressed home upon the people with such urgency were often shirked and avoided by the learned and cultured scribe-class as a body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
