The mountains refer to the hill country surrounding Judea, offering a place of refuge. This command echoes the urgency and necessity for immediate action, reminiscent of Lot's escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>). The directive to flee highlights the severity of the coming judgment and the need for discernment and obedience to divine warnings.<p><b>let those in the city get out</b><br>The city refers to Jerusalem, the epicenter of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple. Jesus' warning to leave the city underscores the impending danger and destruction that would befall Jerusalem. Historically, Christians heeded this warning and fled to Pella, a city in the Decapolis, thus avoiding the catastrophic siege. This phrase emphasizes the importance of heeding prophetic warnings and the protection found in obedience.<p><b>and let those in the country stay out of the city</b><br>This instruction advises those in the surrounding rural areas to avoid seeking refuge in Jerusalem, contrary to the typical instinct to find safety within city walls during times of conflict. The historical context reveals that the Roman siege led to severe famine and suffering within Jerusalem, making it a place of peril rather than safety.
