His role was to maintain order and enforce Roman law. Pilate's questioning of Jesus occurs during the trial before the crucifixion, highlighting the political tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership. Pilate's involvement fulfills the necessity of Roman approval for capital punishment, as the Jewish leaders sought to have Jesus executed.<p><b>&#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</b><br>This question addresses the charge brought against Jesus by the Jewish leaders, who accused Him of claiming to be a king, thus challenging Roman authority. The title "King of the Jews" has messianic implications, as it refers to the expected Jewish Messiah who would deliver Israel. This question is significant because it touches on both political and spiritual dimensions, as Jesus' kingship is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You have said so,&#8221; Jesus replied.</b><br>Jesus' response is both an affirmation and a subtle deflection. By saying "You have said so," He acknowledges the title but refrains from directly claiming it in a political sense. This response aligns with His earlier teachings about His kingdom being spiritual rather than earthly. It also fulfills prophecies about the Messiah being misunderstood and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). Jesus' reply demonstrates His wisdom in navigating the political and religious traps set before Him, maintaining His mission to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

The Sanhedrin framed it to sound like treason against Caesar (<a href="/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that even hostile authorities are under God&#8217;s sovereign plan; Jesus had foretold this moment (<a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</b><p>Pilate voices the central accusation.<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;King of the Jews&#8221; points directly to messianic prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Pharisees expect a national liberator; Pilate fears a rival to Rome.

Pilate, having gone into the judgment-hall again, proceeds to interrogate Jesus. The first two accusations he passes over, seeing clearly that they were baseless. The third, however, struck him. Art <span class="accented">thou</span>, poor, friendless, powerless Man, the King I have been hearing about? <span class="cmt_word">And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it</span>. St. Luke gives only this bare summary of the examination, in which the prisoner Jesus simply replies "Yes," he was the King. St. John (<a href="/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33-38</a>) gives us a more full and detailed account. It is more than probable that John was present during the interrogatory. In the sublime answers of the Lord, his words explanatory of the nature of his kingdom, which "is not of this world," struck Pilate and decided him to give the reply we find in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
