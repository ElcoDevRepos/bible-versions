This setting is significant as it highlights the familiarity and skepticism of those who knew Him from His youth. Jesus often used direct speech to convey important teachings and to challenge prevailing attitudes.<p><b>&#8220;Surely you will quote this proverb to Me:</b><br>The use of the word "surely" suggests Jesus' awareness of the thoughts and expectations of His listeners. The mention of a proverb indicates a common saying or wisdom that would have been familiar to His audience. Proverbs were often used in Jewish culture to convey deeper truths or to challenge behavior.<p><b>&#8216;Physician, heal yourself!</b><br>This proverb implies a demand for proof or validation. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it reflects the skepticism of the people of Nazareth who doubted His authority and power. The phrase suggests that they expected Jesus to demonstrate His miraculous abilities for their benefit, similar to how a physician would first heal his own ailments before treating others.<p><b>Do here in Your hometown</b><br>The reference to "Your hometown" emphasizes the setting of Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. This phrase underscores the challenge Jesus faced in being accepted as a prophet in His own community. It reflects the broader biblical theme of a prophet not being honored in his own country, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/4-44.htm">John 4:44</a>.<p><b>what we have heard that You did in Capernaum.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often serving as His base of operations. The people of Nazareth had heard of the miracles and teachings Jesus performed there, such as healing the centurion's servant and the paralytic. This phrase highlights the expectation for Jesus to replicate those miracles in Nazareth, revealing a lack of faith and understanding of His mission. The demand for signs and wonders is a recurring theme in the Gospels, often contrasted with the call for genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the people in His hometown of Nazareth.

Now, up to this time in Jesus' public career no miracles are recorded as having been done in Capernaum. After the miracle at Cana we know that the Lord resided for some time in Capernaum (<a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>); the miracles to which these men of Nazarath alluded were no doubt worked then. 'The memory of these early miracles, as Godet well observes, would have been effaced by more remarkable later events, as that at Cana would have been had not John, who required it in the plan of his Gospel, rescued it from oblivion. The Jews of Nazareth, after the first moment of surprise and admiration at Jesus' words, evidently looked at him with scorn and unbelief. That poor Carpenter their glorious expected Messiah! As for the marvellous deeds reported to have been done in Capernaum, they did not believe in them; at least why did he not here, in the neighborhood of his own home, something of the same kind? If they could see with their eyes marvels worked by him, then perhaps they might accept him as Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
