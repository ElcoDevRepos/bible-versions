Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, holds significant religious and historical importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. It symbolizes the heart of the Jewish nation and its spiritual state. The repetition of the name indicates a personal and profound sorrow, similar to other biblical instances where names are repeated for emphasis (e.g., "Martha, Martha" in <a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41</a>).<p><b>who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her</b><br>This phrase highlights the historical pattern of Israel's rejection of God's messengers. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah faced persecution and death for delivering God's messages. Stoning was a common method of execution for perceived blasphemy or false prophecy, reflecting the severity of the rejection. This pattern of resistance to divine correction is a recurring theme in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>).<p><b>how often I have longed to gather your children together</b><br>This expresses Jesus' desire to protect and nurture the people of Jerusalem, akin to God's repeated calls for Israel to return to Him throughout the Old Testament. It reflects God's patience and persistent love, despite Israel's continual disobedience. This longing is reminiscent of God's covenantal promises and His desire for a relationship with His people (e.g., <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>).<p><b>as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings</b><br>This metaphor illustrates protection, care, and intimacy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the imagery of a bird sheltering its young is a common symbol of divine protection (e.g., <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). It conveys the safety and security found in God's presence, contrasting with the vulnerability of those who reject Him.<p><b>but you were unwilling!</b><br>This highlights the tragic reality of Jerusalem's resistance to Jesus' offer of salvation and protection. It underscores human free will and the consequences of rejecting God's grace. This unwillingness is a fulfillment of prophetic warnings about Israel's hardness of heart (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>) and foreshadows the impending judgment and destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city is central to Jewish identity and worship, often representing the people of Israel as a whole.

Here, as in other like cases, we have to choose between the alternatives of the words having been spoken on two different though similar occasions, or of one of the Evangelists misplacing the words which were actually spoken but once. As with most other passages thus re-appearing in a different context, I hold the former to be by far the most probable. In each report, it may be noted, they fit into the context with a perfectly natural coherence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee!</span> This exquisite and moving apostrophe was uttered in similar language in the Passion-week, just as Jesus was leaving the temple for the last time. It was spoken here with rare appropriateness in the first instance after the promise of sad irony that the holy city should not be deprived of the spectacle of the Teacher-Prophet's death. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" It was a farewell to the holy city. It was the sorrowful summing-up of the tenderest love of centuries. Never had earthly city been loved like this. There the anointed of the Eternal were to fix their home. There the stately shrine for the service of the invisible King of Israel was to keep watch and ward over the favoured capital of the chosen race. There the visible presence of the Lord God Almighty, the Glory and the Pride of the people, was ever and anon to rest. And in this solemn last farewell, the Master looked back through the vista of the past ages of Jerusalem's history, It was a dark and gloomy contemplation. It had been all along the wicked chief city of a wicked people, of a people who had thrown away the fairest chances ever offered to men - the city of a people whose annals were memorable for deeds of blood, for the most striking ingratitude, for incapacity, for folly shading into crime. Not once nor twice in that dark story of Israel chosen messengers of the invisible King had visited the city he loved so well. These were invested with the high credentials which belong to envoys from the King of kings, with a voice sweeter and more persuasive, with a power grander and more far-reaching than were the common heritage of men; and these envoys, his prophets, they had maltreated, persecuted, murdered. <span class="cmt_word">How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings!</span> God's great love to Israel had been imaged in the far back days of the people, when Moses judged them, under a similar metaphor. Then it was the eagle fluttering over her young and bearing them on her wings; now it is slightly altered to one if possible more tender and loving, certainly more homely. How often in bygone days would the almighty wings, indeed, had Israel only wished it, have been spread out over them a sure shelter! Now the time of grace was over, and the almighty wings were folded. <span class="cmt_word">And ye would not!</span> Sad privilege, specially mentioned here by the Divine Teacher, this freedom of man's will to resist the grace of God. "Ye would not," says the Master, thus joining the generation who heard his voice to the stiffnecked Israel of the days of the wicked kings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">O Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#8052;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Ierousal&#275;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2419.htm">Strong's 2419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Hierusalem, the capitol of Palestine.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#942;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Ierousal&#275;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2419.htm">Strong's 2419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Hierusalem, the capitol of Palestine.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Vocative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
