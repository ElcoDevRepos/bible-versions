The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, emphasizing both Jesus' humanity and His divine authority. The phrase "as it has been determined" underscores the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, prophesied throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. This reflects the theological concept that Jesus' death was not a tragic accident but a divinely orchestrated event for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>but woe to that man who betrays Him.</b><br>This part of the verse introduces a moral and ethical dimension, highlighting human responsibility and the grave consequences of betrayal. The "woe" is a pronouncement of judgment, often used by prophets in the Old Testament to warn of impending doom (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>). Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would betray Jesus, is the subject of this warning. His betrayal is a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist, a type of Christ's betrayal. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the personal accountability each individual holds, even within the framework of divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," a title that emphasizes both His humanity and His messianic role.

St. Matthew, in his account, here adds some more words spoken by the Master, "It had been good for that man if he had not been born." Dean Plumptre, on this saying of Christ, very suggestively remarks, "Awful as the words were, they have their bright as well as their dark side. According to the estimate which men commonly form, the words are true of all except these who depart this life in the faith and fear of God. In his applying them to the case of the traitor in its exceptional enormity, there is suggested the thought that for others whose guilt was not like his, existence even in the penal suffering which their sins have brought upon them may be better than never to have been at all." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8050;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3303.htm">Strong's 3303: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; properly, indicative of affirmation or concession; usually followed by a contrasted clause with de.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
