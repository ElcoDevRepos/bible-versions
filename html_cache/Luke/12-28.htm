In biblical times, grass was a common sight in the fields of Israel, often used as a metaphor for the transient nature of life (<a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>). The imagery of God clothing the grass suggests His attention to even the smallest details of His creation, reflecting His sovereignty and providence. This echoes the creation narrative where God provides for all living things (<a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11-12</a>).<p><b>which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace</b><br>The transience of grass is emphasized here, illustrating the fleeting nature of earthly life. In the cultural context, grass was often used as fuel for ovens, a common practice in ancient Israel due to the scarcity of wood. This serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of material things and the importance of focusing on eternal values. The imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of the brevity of life (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>).<p><b>how much more will He clothe you</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores God's greater care for humans, who are made in His image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). It reassures believers of God's provision, encouraging trust in His ability to meet their needs. The comparison between grass and humans highlights the value God places on human life, aligning with Jesus' teaching on God's care for His people (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>).<p><b>O you of little faith!</b><br>This phrase is a gentle rebuke, calling believers to trust in God's provision. It reflects a common theme in Jesus' teachings, where He challenges His followers to have faith (<a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26, 14</a>:31). The call to faith is central to the Christian life, emphasizing reliance on God rather than material security. This phrase encourages believers to grow in their trust and dependence on God, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of faith as a response to God's promises (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, offering a teaching on God's provision and care.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, representing believers who are learning to trust in God's provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/grass_of_the_field.htm">Grass of the Field</a></b><br>Used as a metaphor for the temporary and transient nature of earthly things.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The provider and sustainer, who cares for all creation, including the grass and His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/furnace.htm">Furnace</a></b><br>Represents the temporary nature of earthly things, as grass is used for fuel and quickly consumed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for even the smallest parts of His creation, like the grass.

The Creator lavishes attention on what most people step over without a thought.&#8221; That daily, visible evidence anchors our confidence that God&#8217;s care is not abstract; it is practical and ongoing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace</b><p>Grass has a short lifespan and, in first-century homes, was routinely used as fuel for clay ovens.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> echoes this brevity: &#8220;You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a> reminds us that &#8220;all flesh is grass&#8230; the grass withers&#8230; but the word of our God stands forever.&#8221;<p>By contrasting beauty with brevity, Jesus underscores that God willingly invests creativity and color in something fleeting. If He does that for a disposable fuel source, His willingness to sustain His people&#8212;who bear His image and eternal purpose&#8212;is beyond question.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how much more will He clothe you</b><p>Here comes the warm logic of a loving Father: from lesser to greater.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a> applies the same reasoning: if God did not spare His own Son, &#8220;how will He not also&#8230; graciously give us all things?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a> promises that &#8220;my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p>Jesus is not offering a vague optimism; He is guaranteeing provision.

If He clothes short-lived grass with such splendor, He will certainly clothe, supply, and sustain His children. The fleeting nature of grass compared to our eternal value makes anxiety illogical. Instead, Jesus calls us to trade &#8220;little faith&#8221; for confident reliance on a Father whose generosity is visible in every blade of grass and guaranteed in every promise of His unchanging Word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
