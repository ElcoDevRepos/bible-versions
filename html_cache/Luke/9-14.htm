The count of "five thousand men" likely refers to the heads of families, suggesting the actual number of people, including women and children, could be much higher. This detail emphasizes the miraculous nature of the feeding, as such a large crowd would require a substantial amount of food. The setting is near Bethsaida, a town on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which was a fertile area known for its agriculture. The large gathering reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the people's eagerness to hear His teachings and witness His miracles. This event is one of the few miracles recorded in all four Gospels, underscoring its significance in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>He told His disciples,</b><br>Jesus' instruction to His disciples demonstrates His role as a teacher and leader. The disciples are often portrayed as learners who are being prepared for their future roles in spreading the Gospel. This moment is a teaching opportunity for them, as they witness firsthand the power and provision of God through Jesus. It also foreshadows the disciples' future responsibilities in organizing and caring for the early Christian communities.<p><b>&#8220;Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to organize the crowd into groups of fifty serves several purposes. Practically, it facilitates the distribution of food, ensuring that everyone is served efficiently. This organization reflects the orderliness of God's creation and His provision. Biblically, the number fifty can symbolize deliverance or freedom, as seen in the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), when debts were forgiven, and slaves were freed. This connection may suggest a deeper spiritual significance, pointing to the freedom and sustenance found in Christ. Additionally, this orderly arrangement mirrors the structure of the Israelites during their wilderness journey, where they were organized into groups for better management (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).

Faith often requires taking a position of readiness before the provision arrives.<p>&#8226; Fifty is manageable: each disciple (plus perhaps helpers) could serve one or two clusters.

St. Matthew adds, "besides women and children." The multitude generally had come from a considerable distance, we know; there would not be, comparatively speaking, many women and children among them. These were grouped together apart, and, of course, fed, but were not counted among the five thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in</span> <span class="cmt_word">a company.</span> "Jesus has no sooner ascertained that there are five loaves and two fishes, than he is satisfied. He commands them to make the multitude sit down. Just as though he had said, 'I have what I want; the meal is ready; let them be seated!' But he takes care that his banquet shall be conducted with an order worthy of the God who gives it. Everything must be calm and solemn; it is a kind of Passover meal. By the help of the apostles, he seats his guests in rows of fifty each (St.. Matthew), or in double rows of fifty, by hundreds (Mark). This orderly arrangement allowed of the guests being easily counted. St. Mark describes in a dramatic manner the striking spectacle presented by these regularly formed companies, each consisting of two equal ranks, and all arranged upon the slope of the hill. The pastures at that time were in all their spring glory. SS. John and Mark both bring forward the beauty of this natural carpet. 'Much grass' (St. John); 'on the green grass' (St. Mark)" (Godet). St. Mark's vivid picturesque details show the observant eve-witness. The words rendered "in ranks" ("they sat down in ranks") literally mean they were like flower-beds set in the green grass. The bright-coloured Eastern robes of these men, as they sat in long rows, suggested the happy comparison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
