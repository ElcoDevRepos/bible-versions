It was a time of celebration and community gathering. Weddings in Jewish culture were highly esteemed, and the invitation to such an event was considered an honor. The imagery of a wedding banquet is frequently used in Scripture to symbolize the kingdom of God (e.g., <a href="/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). This setting provides a backdrop for Jesus' teaching on humility and social conduct.<p><b>do not sit in the place of honor</b><br>In ancient Jewish society, seating arrangements at banquets were a reflection of social status. The place of honor was typically reserved for the most distinguished guests. Jesus' instruction here challenges the cultural norms of seeking status and recognition. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of humility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6-7</a>, which advises against self-promotion. Jesus Himself exemplified humility, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where He took the form of a servant.<p><b>in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited</b><br>This phrase highlights the potential embarrassment and social faux pas of assuming a position of honor without merit. It reflects the wisdom of humility and the danger of pride, as echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The concept of being "more distinguished" also points to the divine order and God's sovereignty in exalting the humble and humbling the proud, as seen in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>. Jesus' teaching here is a practical application of the principle that "the last will be first, and the first will be last" (<a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, offering wisdom on humility and social conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wedding_banquet.htm">Wedding Banquet</a></b><br>A social event symbolizing the Kingdom of God, where guests are invited to partake in a celebration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guests.htm">Guests</a></b><br>Individuals invited to the banquet, representing believers and followers of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/host.htm">Host</a></b><br>The one who invites guests, symbolizing God or Christ in the context of the Kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/place_of_honor.htm">Place of Honor</a></b><br>A seat of distinction, representing human desire for recognition and status.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_social_settings.htm">Humility in Social Settings</a></b><br>Jesus teaches the importance of humility, especially in social gatherings.

God Himself determines honor; any seat we seize for ourselves is insecure.<p>- Practically, refusing the prominent spot frees us to serve others rather than guard our status, echoing Jesus&#8217; own example of washing His disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited.</b><p>- A higher-ranking guest might appear, and the host would rightly reassign seats. Pride always risks public loss of face. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> confirms, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.&#8221;<p>- The scene pictures the final judgment, where God will reveal true distinctions. <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> says, &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,&#8221; and <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a> urges, &#8220;Humble yourselves&#8230; so that He may exalt you at the proper time.&#8221;<p>- By warning of possible demotion, Jesus appeals both to wisdom and to love: He spares disciples from shame and spares hosts from awkwardness.<p>- Ultimately, the &#8220;more distinguished&#8221; guest is Christ Himself. Any honor we grasp pales next to His glory; therefore we gladly yield the highest place to Him now and forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8</a> teaches practical humility rooted in the certainty that God, not we, assigns honor. At every gathering&#8212;social or eternal&#8212;we come as invited guests, never owners.

The pretensions and conceit of the Jewish doctors of the Law had been for a long period intolerable. We have repeated examples in the Talmud of the exaggerated estimate these, the scholars and doctors of the Law, formed of themselves, and of the respect they exacted from all classes of the community. One can well imagine the grave displeasure with which the Divine Teacher looked upon this unholy frame of mind, and upon the miserable petty struggles which constantly were resulting from it. The expositors of the Law of God, the religious guides of the people, were setting an example of self-seeking, were showing what was their estimate of a fitting reward, what was the crown of learning which they coveted - the first seats at a banquet, the title of respect and honour! How the Lord - the very essence of whose teaching was self-surrender and self-sacrifice - must have mourned over such pitiful exhibitions of weakness shown by the men who claimed to sit in Moses' seat! <span class="cmt_word">Lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place</span>. As an instance of such unseemly contention, Dr. Farrar quotes from the Talmud how, "at a banquet of King Alexander Jannaeus, the rabbi Simeon ben Shetach, in spite of the presence of some great Persian satraps, had thrust himself at table between the king and queen, and when rebuked for his intrusion quoted in his defence Ecclus. 15:5, 'Exalt wisdom, and She... shall make thee sit among princes.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
