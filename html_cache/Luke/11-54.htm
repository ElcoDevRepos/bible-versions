Their intent was not to learn from Him but to find fault. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus is frequently challenged by those in authority. The Greek term used here implies a sense of lying in wait, similar to a hunter stalking prey. This adversarial stance is consistent with the broader narrative of the Gospels, where Jesus is often depicted as being under scrutiny by those who feel threatened by His teachings and authority.<p><b>in something He might say</b><br>The focus on Jesus' words highlights the power and authority of His teaching. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' words are portrayed as having divine authority, often challenging the established religious norms. The leaders' attempt to trap Him in His words is reminiscent of other instances where they question Him on matters of law and tradition, such as paying taxes to Caesar (<a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20-26</a>) or the woman caught in adultery (<a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3-11</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of the Word of God being living and active, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. The leaders' inability to trap Jesus underscores His wisdom and the divine nature of His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being scrutinized by the religious leaders.
