The Sadducees were a Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits, focusing instead on the Torah. The number seven is often symbolic in the Bible, representing completeness or perfection. The use of seven brothers in this context may emphasize the thoroughness of the scenario they are presenting to challenge Jesus.<p><b>The first one married a wife</b><br>Marriage in Jewish culture was a significant covenant, often arranged by families to ensure the continuation of lineage and inheritance. The mention of marriage here sets the stage for a discussion on levirate marriage, a practice outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, where a man is obligated to marry his deceased brother's widow if the brother died without offspring. This practice was intended to preserve the family line and property within the tribe.<p><b>but died childless.</b><br>Dying childless was considered a misfortune in ancient Jewish society, as children were seen as a blessing from God and a means to carry on the family name and inheritance. The absence of children in this scenario is crucial, as it triggers the levirate marriage obligation. This detail also highlights the Sadducees' focus on earthly concerns and inheritance, contrasting with Jesus' teachings on eternal life and the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_brothers.htm">Seven Brothers</a></b><br>A hypothetical group of siblings used in the Sadducees' question to Jesus.

(<a href="/luke/20-29.htm">Luke 20:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This opening line signals that what follows is a real&#8208;life legal scenario rooted in the law of Moses (see <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>), not a fanciful riddle.<p>&#8226; By mentioning &#8220;seven,&#8221; the Sadducees push the case to an extreme to challenge the truth of the resurrection, a doctrine they denied (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar wording appears in parallel passages&#8212;<a href="/matthew/22-25.htm">Matthew 22:25</a> and <a href="/mark/12-20.htm">Mark 12:20</a>&#8212;showing this was a well-known story line used to corner Jesus.<p>&#8226; The number seven also hints at completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>), emphasizing that every possible earthly husband is exhausted in their example.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The first one married a wife</b><p>&#8220;The first one married a wife&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-29.htm">Luke 20:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Marriage here reflects the divine institution established in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>&#8212;one man, one woman, covenant commitment.<p>&#8226; According to levirate law, if a married man died without offspring, his brother was to marry the widow to provide an heir and preserve the family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The Sadducees build on this law to pose their dilemma, assuming earthly marriage norms must continue unchanged into the resurrection age. Jesus will soon correct that misunderstanding (<a href="/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But died childless</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but died childless.&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-29.htm">Luke 20:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Childlessness triggers the levirate responsibility; without children, the deceased&#8217;s name and inheritance risk extinction (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, being childless carried social and spiritual weight, yet God repeatedly showed His ability to bring life from barrenness (e.g., Sarah in <a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>; Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The Sadducees assume a tragic outcome to intensify the problem: no children, six more brothers to go, and&#8212;so they think&#8212;an insoluble marriage tangle in the resurrection.<p>&#8226; Their focus on earthly lineage misses the greater hope: in the resurrection, identity and inheritance are secured by God Himself, not by human offspring (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/20-29.htm">Luke 20:29</a> sets the stage for Jesus to reveal that earthly institutions&#8212;even marriage&#8212;serve a temporary purpose. The first brother&#8217;s death without children highlights humanity&#8217;s limits and the Old Testament provision to sustain family lines, but the Sadducees&#8217; hypothetical cannot trap the Lord. By affirming the resurrection, Jesus will show that God&#8217;s eternal plan surpasses earthly arrangements, ensuring life and legacy through His power rather than human effort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
