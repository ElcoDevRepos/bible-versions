It encompasses both a present reality and a future fulfillment. In the context of first-century Judaism, the kingdom was often expected to be a political or military dominion. However, Jesus redefines it as a spiritual kingdom, characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>).<p><b>To what can I compare it?</b><br>Jesus often used parables and comparisons to illustrate complex spiritual truths in relatable terms. By asking this question, He invites His audience to consider the nature of God's kingdom in a way that challenges their preconceived notions.

The first impression with most readers, in the absence of any apparent trace of sequence, is that we have an isolated fragment of our Lord's teaching, torn from the context in which we find it in St. Matthew. On the other hand, we must remember (1) that our Lord was in the synagogue, and it was on the Sabbath day, and that so both time and place called for teaching of some kind; and (2) that the parables that follow may well be regarded but as samples of the teaching which those who were in the synagogue had treasured up in their memories. They were fit and edifying parables at any time; not least so, assuredly, at this. When proof had been given that the Kingdom of God had indeed come nigh unto men, it was well to set before them something as to its nature, its extent, its mode of working inwardly and outwardly; and the fact that the similitudes which did this had been used before, did not necessarily make them inapplicable or unprofitable when used again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">Lord, is two little prophetic parables tells the people how strangely and mightily his religion would spread over the earth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?</span> In the seventeenth verse - after the Lord's words spoken to his enemies, who took exception at his miracle of healing worked for the poor woman who had been bent for eighteen years, because he had done it on the sabbath day - we read how "all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him." This discomfiture of the hypocrites, and the honest joy of the simple folk over a noble and Divine deed of mercy, accompanied by brave, kind words, seem to have suggested to the Master the subject of the two little parables of the mustard seed and the leaven, in which parables the growth of his glorious kingdom was foreshadowed from very small beginnings.
