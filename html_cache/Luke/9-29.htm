This moment occurs during the Transfiguration, a pivotal event where Jesus reveals His divine glory to Peter, James, and John. The act of praying signifies Jesus' dependence on the Father and sets an example for believers to seek God in prayer, especially before significant events. This aligns with other instances where Jesus prays before major decisions or revelations, such as before choosing the twelve apostles (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>).<p><b>the appearance of His face changed</b><br>This transformation signifies the divine nature of Jesus, echoing the Old Testament accounts of Moses, whose face shone after speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). However, unlike Moses, whose radiance was a reflection, Jesus' change emanates from His inherent divinity. This moment foreshadows the glorified state of Christ post-resurrection and serves as a testament to His identity as the Son of God. It also prefigures the transformation believers will undergo in the presence of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><b>and His clothes became radiantly white</b><br>The description of Jesus' clothes becoming radiantly white symbolizes purity, holiness, and divine glory. In biblical symbolism, white garments often represent righteousness and the heavenly realm (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 7</a>:9). This transformation is a visual representation of Jesus' divine nature and His role as the spotless Lamb of God. The radiance of His clothing contrasts with the earthly and fallen state of humanity, highlighting the separation between the divine and the mundane. This imagery also connects to the prophetic vision in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, where the Ancient of Days is described with clothing as white as snow, further affirming Jesus' divine authority and kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted in a moment of divine transformation, highlighting His divine nature and glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>This event occurs on a mountain, traditionally identified as Mount Tabor, where Jesus is transfigured before His disciples, revealing His divine glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>These three disciples are present with Jesus during the Transfiguration, serving as witnesses to this miraculous event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_elijah.htm">Moses and Elijah</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, they appear in the broader context of the Transfiguration, representing the Law and the Prophets, respectively.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>The setting of the Transfiguration, symbolizing a place of divine revelation and encounter with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus' transformation occurs while He is praying, underscoring the importance of prayer in experiencing God's presence and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_of_divine_glory.htm">Revelation of Divine Glory</a></b><br>The Transfiguration reveals Jesus' divine nature, encouraging believers to recognize and worship Him as the Son of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_truth.htm">Witness to the Truth</a></b><br>The presence of Peter, James, and John as witnesses emphasizes the importance of sharing and testifying to the truth of Christ's glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_the_law_and_prophets.htm">Fulfillment of the Law and Prophets</a></b><br>The appearance of Moses and Elijah signifies that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament promises and prophecies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_in_christ.htm">Transformation in Christ</a></b><br>Just as Jesus was transformed, believers are called to be transformed into His likeness through the renewing of their minds.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_29_Prayer_s_transformative_power.htm">How does Luke 9:29 illustrate the transformative power of prayer in our lives?

Believers are invited to behold the same Lord&#8212;majestic, holy, and accessible through prayer&#8212;whose unveiled glory guarantees the certainty of His Kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">And as he prayed.</span>--We again note, as characteristic of St. Luke, the stress laid upon our Lord's prayers here, as before in <a href="/luke/3-21.htm" title="Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,">Luke 3:21</a>; <a href="/luke/5-16.htm" title="And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The fashion of his countenance was altered.</span>--It is, perhaps, noticeable that the Evangelist who had the most classical culture avoids the use of the classical word "transfigured" or "metamorphosed," employed by the others. For him that word might have seemed too suggestive of the "metamorphoses" which the great work of Ovid had connected with the legends of Greek mythology.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,</span> etc. The marvellous change evidently passed over Jesus <span class="accented">while</span> he was in prayer, probably <span class="accented">because</span> of his intense prayer. Real, close communion with God ever imparts to the countenance of the one who has thus entered into communion with the High and Holy One, a new and strange beauty. Very many have noticed at times this peculiar and lovely change pass over the faces of God's true saints as they prayed - faces perhaps old and withered, grey with years and wrinkled with care. A yet higher degree of transfiguration through communion with God is recorded in the case of Moses, whose face, after he had been with his God-Friend on the mount, shone with so bright a glory that mortal eye could not bear to gaze on it until the radiance began to fade away. A similar change is recorded to have taken place in the case of Stephen when he pleaded his Divine Master's cause in the Sanhedrin hall at Jerusalem with such rapt eloquence that to the by-standers his face then, we read, "was as the face of an angel." Stephen told his audience later on, in the course of that earnest and impassioned pleading, that to him the very heavens were opened, and that his eyes were positively gazing on the beatific vision. Yet a step higher still was this transfiguration of our Lord. St. Luke tells us simply that, "as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered." St. Matthew tells us <span class="accented">how</span> it was altered when he writes that "his countenance shone as the sun." <span class="cmt_word">And his raiment was white and glistering</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lightening forth</span>, as if from some inward source of glorious light. The earthly robes were so beautified by contact with this Divine light that human language is exhausted by the evangelists to find terms and metaphors to picture them. St. Matthew compares these garments of the Blessed One to light; St. Mark, to the snow; St. Luke, to the flashing lightning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
