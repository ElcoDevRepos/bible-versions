According to the Law, a woman who had given birth was considered ceremonially unclean and needed to offer a sacrifice for her purification. This act of offering a sacrifice underscores the importance of adherence to the Law, which was central to Jewish life and worship. It also highlights the humility and obedience of Mary and Joseph, who followed the Law despite the divine nature of Jesus' birth. This obedience to the Law is a recurring theme in the life of Jesus, who stated in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a> that He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it.<p><b>&#8220;A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&#8221;</b><br>The offering of turtledoves or pigeons was a provision in the Law for those who could not afford a lamb, indicating the modest economic status of Mary and Joseph. This provision is found in <a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>, which allows for a less costly sacrifice, demonstrating God's compassion and understanding of human circumstances. The choice of birds for the sacrifice is significant, as birds were often used in sacrificial rites due to their availability and affordability. This offering also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, though rich, became poor for humanity's sake (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). The use of birds in the sacrificial system can be seen as a type of Christ, who would later offer Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the requirements of the Law once and for all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_joseph.htm">Mary and Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly parents of Jesus, who are fulfilling the requirements of the Law of Moses by presenting Jesus at the temple and offering a sacrifice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jewish people, where sacrifices and offerings were made according to the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_the_lord.htm">The Law of the Lord</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, specifically the purification rites after childbirth as outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/12.htm">Leviticus 12</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/turtledoves_and_pigeons.htm">Turtledoves and Pigeons</a></b><br>These birds were the offerings prescribed for those who could not afford a lamb, indicating Mary and Joseph's humble economic status.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_law.htm">Obedience to God's Law</a></b><br>Mary and Joseph's actions demonstrate their commitment to obeying God's commandments, even in humble circumstances.

We may see, therefore, in this fact, another indication of the poverty of Joseph and his espoused wife. The offering had, like all other sacrifices, to be made in the Temple. It seems all but certain that this visit to Jerusalem must have preceded the visit of the Magi. After that, it would have been perilous in the extreme, and the narrative of Matthew 2 implies an immediate departure for Egypt after they had left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons</span>. The proper offering was a lamb for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or dove for a sin offering; but for the poor an alternative was allowed - instead of the more costly present of a lamb, a second pigeon or dove might be brought. The deep poverty of Mary and Joseph is shown in this offering.
