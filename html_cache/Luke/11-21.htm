In the context of the passage, the "strong man" can be seen as a metaphor for Satan or any force of evil that holds power over a domain. The imagery of strength is often used in Scripture to denote authority and control, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24-25</a>, where God promises to deliver the captives from the mighty.<p><b>fully armed</b><br>The description of being "fully armed" suggests preparation and readiness for defense or battle. In the ancient world, being fully armed would involve having the necessary weapons and armor to protect oneself and one's territory. This can be paralleled with <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>, where believers are encouraged to put on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes, highlighting the spiritual warfare theme.<p><b>guards his house</b><br>The act of guarding implies vigilance and the responsibility of protecting one's domain. In biblical times, a house was not just a physical structure but represented one's family, possessions, and livelihood. The concept of guarding is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding one's heart, indicating the importance of protecting what is valuable.<p><b>his possessions are secure</b><br>This phrase indicates a state of safety and stability. The possessions being secure suggests that the strong man has control and authority over his domain. In a broader spiritual sense, this can be seen as the temporary security that evil forces may have over their captives until a stronger force intervenes. This is further illustrated in the subsequent verses where Jesus speaks of overcoming the strong man, symbolizing His victory over Satan and the liberation of those held captive by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/strong_man.htm">Strong Man</a></b><br>Represents a person or force that is powerful and well-prepared to defend what they possess. In the context of Jesus' teaching, it can symbolize Satan or any stronghold of sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Symbolizes the domain or territory under the control of the strong man. This can be a literal home, a person's life, or a broader spiritual realm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/possessions.htm">Possessions</a></b><br>Refers to the assets or valuables that the strong man seeks to protect. Spiritually, this can represent the souls or lives under the influence of sin or evil.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fully_armed.htm">Fully Armed</a></b><br>Indicates being equipped with the necessary tools or weapons to defend against threats. In a spiritual sense, it can refer to the defenses that sin or evil uses to maintain control.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_teaching.htm">Jesus' Teaching</a></b><br>This parable is part of Jesus' response to accusations that He casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, emphasizing His authority over evil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_warfare.htm">Understanding Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual battles are real, and the "strong man" represents the forces of evil that seek to control and influence lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_christ.htm">The Power of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is stronger than any "strong man" and has the authority to overcome and bind the forces of evil.

The very next verse says, &#8220;But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him...&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-22.htm">Luke 11:22</a>). Christ is that &#8220;someone stronger.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a> assures that once Christ rescues, &#8220;no one can snatch [them] out of My hand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse also challenges believers: anything we try to protect in our own strength will never be truly secure. Only entrusting all we have to Jesus brings lasting safety (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-21.htm">Luke 11:21</a> paints a vivid snapshot of Satan as a heavily armed strong man guarding his stolen goods. The image seems daunting until Jesus, the &#8220;someone stronger,&#8221; steps into view. The verse exposes both the enemy&#8217;s temporary grip on souls and the futility of relying on human power. It invites trust in Christ&#8217;s superior strength, reminding us that true security&#8212;of life, family, future, and eternity&#8212;rests in Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21-23) <span class= "bld">When a strong man armed keepeth his palace.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29-30</a>.
