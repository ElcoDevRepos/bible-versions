The term "Sir" reflects the servant's acknowledgment of authority, which is a common cultural practice in ancient Near Eastern societies. This relationship can be seen as a reflection of the believer's relationship with God, where God is the ultimate authority and believers are His servants. The servant's role is crucial in the parable, symbolizing those who carry out God's will on earth.<p><b>&#8216;what you ordered has been done&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates obedience and fulfillment of the master's command. In the context of the parable, the master represents God, and the servant's actions reflect the faithful execution of God's will. This obedience is a central theme in Christian teachings, emphasizing the importance of following God's commandments. The phrase also suggests the completion of a task, which in the broader narrative of the parable, refers to the invitation extended to the initial guests. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's invitation to His people, as seen in the Old Testament with Israel and in the New Testament with the call to salvation through Christ.<p><b>and there is still room.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the abundance and inclusivity of God's kingdom. Despite the initial invitation being fulfilled, there is still space available, symbolizing the boundless grace and mercy of God. This can be linked to the idea that God's invitation to salvation is open to all, not limited by ethnicity, social status, or past actions. Theologically, it underscores the concept of the "whosoever will" in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God's love and salvation are available to anyone who believes. The imagery of "room" also connects to the eschatological promise of eternal life, where there is ample space in God's heavenly kingdom for all who accept His invitation.<div class="vheading2">Persons

acknowledgement: &#8220;Sir&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-22.htm">Luke 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; His address highlights the rightful authority of the master&#8212;an echo of the biblical truth that God is sovereign over His household (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as the centurion called Jesus &#8220;Lord&#8221; in <a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8</a>, this word models humble submission.<p>&#8226; The honorific sets the tone: everything that follows is an obedient report to the One in charge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the servant replied,</b><p>&#8226; The servant in the parable stands for those who deliver God&#8217;s invitations&#8212;initially Israel&#8217;s prophets and ultimately

&#8220;give an account&#8221; before Christ (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment mirrors Jesus&#8217; sending of the seventy-two, who &#8220;returned with joy&#8221;
