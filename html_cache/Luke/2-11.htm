This moment marks a pivotal point in history, fulfilling prophecies and expectations of the Messiah's arrival. The use of "today" signifies the present reality of God's intervention in human history.<p><b>in the city of David</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the city of David, is significant as the birthplace of King David and the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). This connection underscores Jesus' rightful claim to the Davidic lineage, fulfilling the covenant God made with David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>a Savior</b><br>The term "Savior" highlights Jesus' role in delivering humanity from sin and death. This title connects to Old Testament themes of salvation, where God is often depicted as the deliverer of His people (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>). Jesus' mission is to bring spiritual salvation, offering redemption and reconciliation with God.<p><b>has been born to you</b><br>The personal nature of this announcement emphasizes that Jesus' birth is for the benefit of all people. The angel's message to the shepherds signifies that this good news is not just for the elite or religious leaders but for everyone, including the humble and marginalized.<p><b>He is Christ</b><br>"Christ" is the Greek equivalent of "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This title affirms Jesus as the long-awaited deliverer and king, fulfilling numerous Old Testament prophecies (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-26</a>). Jesus is the anointed king who brings God's kingdom to earth.<p><b>the Lord!</b><br>Calling Jesus "the Lord" attributes to Him divine authority and sovereignty. This title is used in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) to translate the Hebrew name for God, Yahweh. It affirms Jesus' divine nature and His role as the ruler over all creation, aligning with prophecies of a divine ruler (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>This refers to Bethlehem, the birthplace of King David, and now the birthplace of Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah's lineage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/savior.htm">Savior</a></b><br>Jesus is identified as the Savior, indicating His role in delivering humanity from sin and death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The term "Christ" is derived from the Greek "Christos," meaning "Anointed One," equivalent to the Hebrew "Messiah."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>This title affirms Jesus' divine authority and His identity as God incarnate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels_and_shepherds.htm">Angels and Shepherds</a></b><br>The announcement of Jesus' birth was made by angels to shepherds, symbolizing the good news being shared with humble and ordinary people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' birth in Bethlehem fulfills Old Testament prophecies, demonstrating God's faithfulness and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humble_arrival_of_the_savior.htm">The Humble Arrival of the Savior</a></b><br>Jesus' birth in humble circumstances reminds us that God's ways often defy human expectations and values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The announcement to shepherds signifies that the good news of Jesus is for all people, regardless of status or background.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus_as_lord.htm">Recognizing Jesus as Lord</a></b><br>Acknowledging Jesus as both Savior and Lord is essential for a true understanding of His identity and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_light_of_the_savior's_birth.htm">Living in the Light of the Savior's Birth</a></b><br>The birth of Jesus calls us to live with hope, joy, and a commitment to share the good news with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_2_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 2:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_2_11_Jesus_as_Savior_daily.htm">How does Luke 2:11 affirm Jesus as the Savior in your daily life?

The long-awaited fulfillment is not someday, but now, right where the shepherds stand. Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s perfect timing: &#8220;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). That same immediacy echoes <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>&#8212;&#8220;This is the day that the LORD has made.&#8221; The good news is not a distant theory; it breaks into ordinary life at a precise, measurable point in time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the city of David</b><p>Bethlehem, called the city of David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), ties Jesus directly to the royal line God promised would endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> foretold, &#8220;But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah&#8230; out of you will come for Me One to be Ruler over Israel.&#8221; By placing the birth here, God stitches together prophecy, covenant, and geography. Bethlehem&#8217;s smallness magnifies God&#8217;s grace&#8212;greatness arrives in humble settings, just as later He will ride a colt into Jerusalem (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a Savior has been born to you</b><p>&#8220;Savior&#8221; signals deliverance, not merely improvement.<p>&#8226; Rescue from sin&#8217;s penalty (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>: &#8220;He will save His people from their sins&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Freedom from sin&#8217;s power (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Hope of eternal life (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<p>Notice the personal word &#8220;to you.&#8221; The gift is corporate, yet deeply individual. Just as the Passover lamb was chosen for each household (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>), this Savior is appointed for every heart willing to receive Him. The shepherds, social outsiders, hear first&#8212;proof that salvation reaches all strata of society (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is Christ the Lord!</b><p>&#8220;Christ&#8221; means the Anointed One promised throughout the prophets (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). &#8220;The Lord&#8221; declares His deity and sovereign authority. Luke has already hinted at this in Mary&#8217;s visit to Elizabeth: &#8220;Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-43.htm">Luke 1:43</a>). In one breath the angel links humanity (born), mission (Savior), messiahship (Christ), and divinity (Lord). Later, Thomas will echo the same truth: &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>). The baby in the manger is none other than the Creator who upholds all things (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a> condenses the gospel into a single sentence. On a real calendar day, in the prophesied town of Bethlehem, God sent His promised Deliverer&#8212;personally available to every listener&#8212;who is both Messiah and divine Lord. The verse calls each reader to the same response as the shepherds: believe the good news, glorify God, and share the wonder that the Savior has indeed come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Savior</span>.
