Jesus teaching in synagogues highlights His role as a rabbi or teacher, a respected position within Jewish society. This setting allowed Him to reach a broad audience, including both devout Jews and those curious about His message. The synagogues provided a platform for Jesus to interpret the Scriptures, often leading to discussions and debates. This practice of teaching in synagogues is consistent with His mission to fulfill the Law and the Prophets, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>. It also aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which Jesus later reads in a synagogue, declaring His mission to bring good news to the poor.<p><b>and was glorified by everyone</b><br>The phrase indicates that Jesus was well-received and respected by those who heard Him. This initial acceptance contrasts with later opposition He faced, illustrating the varied responses to His ministry. The glorification by everyone suggests that His teachings resonated with the people, possibly due to His authority and the fulfillment of messianic expectations. This acceptance can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, where the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. The widespread glorification also prefigures the universal recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity, as later affirmed in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching in the synagogues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogues.htm">Synagogues</a></b><br>Jewish places of worship and community gathering where Jesus taught.

Wonder, admiration, glory, waited on the new Prophet. Soon, however, when His preaching involved a demand on men's faith and obedience beyond what they had expected, it roused opposition, and the narrative that follows is the first stage of that antagonism.<p>Again, as in St. Matthew, the reader must be reminded that the narrative of John 2-5 comes in between the Temptation and the commencement of the Galilean ministry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he taught in their synagogues</span>, <span class="cmt_word">being glorified of all</span>. His miracles, his words touching and eloquent, perhaps too a dim memory of marvels which had happened years before at his birth, shed round the new Teacher a halo of glory. It was only when, instead of the Messianic hopes of conquest and power which they cherished, a life of brave self-denial and quiet generosity was preached, that the reaction against him set in. The men of Nazareth, with their violent antagonism, which we are about to consider, were only, after all, a few months in advance of the rest of the nation in their rejection of the Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
