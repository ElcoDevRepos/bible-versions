Peter, James, and John are present on a mountain, witnessing Jesus in His glorified state. Peter's speaking reflects his impulsive nature, often seen in the Gospels, where he acts or speaks before fully understanding the situation (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>). His suggestion to build shelters for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah (<a href="/luke/9-33.htm">Luke 9:33</a>) indicates a misunderstanding of the event's significance, possibly seeing it as a permanent establishment of God's kingdom on earth.<p><b>a cloud appeared and enveloped them</b><br>The cloud is a significant biblical symbol, often representing God's presence and glory. In the Old Testament, a cloud led the Israelites through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and covered Mount Sinai when God gave the Law to Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15-18</a>). The appearance of the cloud here signifies divine presence and approval of Jesus, echoing the Shekinah glory. This event connects to the prophetic vision in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" comes with the clouds of heaven, indicating Jesus' divine authority and messianic role.<p><b>and they were afraid as they entered the cloud</b><br>The disciples' fear is a common human reaction to divine encounters, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The fear underscores the awe and reverence due to God's holiness and power. Entering the cloud symbolizes entering into God's presence, a transformative experience that reveals Jesus' true nature and mission. This moment foreshadows the New Covenant, where believers are invited into God's presence through Christ, who mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Transfiguration event, revealing His divine glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples chosen by Jesus to witness the Transfiguration, representing the inner circle of His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_elijah.htm">Moses and Elijah</a></b><br>Appeared with Jesus, symbolizing the Law and the Prophets, respectively.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud.htm">The Cloud</a></b><br>Represents the presence of God, reminiscent of the Shekinah glory in the Old Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice_from_the_cloud.htm">The Voice from the Cloud</a></b><br>God's voice affirming Jesus as His chosen Son, commanding the disciples to listen to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence_and_fear.htm">Divine Presence and Fear</a></b><br>The cloud signifies God's presence, which often evokes a sense of awe and fear.

The episode reassures us that when God draws near, He both humbles and shelters, calling us to listen to His Son and live in the light of His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud</span>. This luminous cloud, bright though it was, yet veiled the more intolerable brightness within. That such a bright cloud had the power of overshadowing and concealing, is not strange, for light in its utmost intensity hides as effectually as the darkness would do. God dwells in light inaccessible, whom therefore "no man hath seen, nor can see" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). Milton writes - <p><span class="accented">"Dark with excess of light."</span> Philo speaks of the highest light as identical with darkness. Anselm thus understands the cloud here, quoting the words of <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, referred to above, and then the words of Moses, "And Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (<a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>), and then this passage from the Transfiguration, and comments thus: "Illa caligo et ista nubes, atque ilia lux idem sunt" (see Archbishop Trench on "Transfiguration," in 'Studies in the Gospels,' 8). The fear which these eye-witnesses remember as one of their experiences that memorable night was a very natural feeling. As the cloud stole over the mountain ridge, and the glory-light gradually paled and waned, the sensation of intense pleasure and satisfaction, which we may assume to be the natural accompaniment of such a blessed scene, would give place to awe and amazement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Peter]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
