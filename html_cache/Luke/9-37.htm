The timing suggests a transition from a moment of divine revelation to the realities of earthly ministry. The "next day" signifies the immediacy of Jesus' return to His mission after a profound spiritual experience.<p><b>when they came down from the mountain</b><br>The mountain is traditionally identified as Mount Hermon or Mount Tabor, though the exact location is not specified in the text. Mountains in biblical narratives often symbolize places of divine encounter and revelation, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai. Coming down from the mountain signifies a return to the world and its challenges, highlighting the dual nature of Jesus' mission&#8212;divine and human.<p><b>Jesus was met by a large crowd</b><br>The presence of a large crowd underscores Jesus' growing popularity and the people's eagerness to witness His teachings and miracles. This reflects the historical context of a society in need of hope and healing, under Roman occupation. The crowd's presence also sets the stage for the subsequent miracle of healing a demon-possessed boy, demonstrating Jesus' authority over spiritual and physical realms. This gathering of people is reminiscent of other instances in the Gospels where Jesus is surrounded by those seeking His help, such as the feeding of the 5,000.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, coming down from the mountain after the Transfiguration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>The place where the Transfiguration occurred, symbolizing a place of divine revelation and encounter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically Peter, James, and John, who were with Jesus on the mountain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_large_crowd.htm">The Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the people eagerly waiting for Jesus, often seeking healing or teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration (Event)</a></b><br>The significant event that occurred just before this verse, where Jesus was revealed in His glory to the three disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_encounters.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Encounters</a></b><br>Just as Jesus and the disciples experienced a profound spiritual encounter on the mountain, we too need moments of spiritual renewal and revelation in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_the_mountain_and_the_valley.htm">Balancing the Mountain and the Valley</a></b><br>After spiritual highs, we must return to the everyday world, ready to serve and minister to those in need, as Jesus did with the crowd.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith_in_ministry.htm">The Role of Faith in Ministry</a></b><br>The disciples' struggle to heal the boy in the following verses highlights the necessity of faith and reliance on God's power in our ministry efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_jesus_in_our_daily_lives.htm">The Presence of Jesus in Our Daily Lives</a></b><br>The crowd's eagerness to meet Jesus reminds us of the importance of seeking His presence daily, not just in extraordinary moments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_challenges.htm">Preparation for Challenges</a></b><br>Spiritual experiences prepare us for the challenges we face in the world, equipping us with the strength and wisdom needed to address them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_37_Jesus_dual_realm_authority.htm">How does Luke 9:37 demonstrate Jesus' authority over spiritual and physical realms?

It probably lasted for a much longer period than the brief account, preserved by the eye-witnesses, seems to speak cf. How long the three disciples slept is not mentioned. Wearied and exhausted, deep slumber overtook them while the Master was praying. When they awoke, Jesus was bathed in glory, and the two heavenly spirits were conversing with him. They only tell us generally that the subject which occupied the blessed ones was their Master's speedy departure from earth; no mention is made of the time all this consumed. It was morning when they rejoined their company. Much people met him. St. Mark, whose account here is more detailed - evidently Peter preserved a very vivid memory of these events - tells us that the crowds, "when they beheld him, were greatly amazed." Without concluding that any lingering radiance of the last night's glory was still playing about his Person, we may well imagine that a holy joy just then lit up that face over which for some time past a cloud of deep sadness had brooded. The heavenly visitants; the words he had been listening to, which told him of his home of grandeur and of peace, voluntarily left by him that he might work his mighty earthwork; - had no doubt strengthened with a strange strength the Man of sorrows; and when the crowds gazed on his face they marvelled, as St. Mark tells us, at what they saw there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
