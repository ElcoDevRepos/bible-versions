His exhortations included ethical teachings and moral imperatives, urging the people to live righteously. This aligns with the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness, similar to prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. John's message was not limited to a single point but encompassed a wide range of teachings, emphasizing the need for spiritual renewal.<p><b>John proclaimed the good news</b><br>The term "good news" or "gospel" is significant, as it denotes the announcement of God's kingdom and salvation. John's proclamation was a precursor to the ministry of Jesus, who would fully reveal the gospel. This message of good news was rooted in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3-5</a>. John's role was to prepare the way for Jesus, making his message foundational to the New Testament narrative.<p><b>to the people</b><br>John's audience was diverse, including Jews from various regions, as well as tax collectors and soldiers, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. This reflects the inclusive nature of the gospel, which would later be fully realized in Jesus' ministry. The people of Israel were in a state of expectation for the Messiah, and John's message resonated with their hopes for deliverance and restoration.

In this and in the next two verses St. Luke once more gives us a little picture of the events which were spread over a considerable area or' time.
