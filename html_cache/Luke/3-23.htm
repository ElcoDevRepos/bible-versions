This age signifies maturity and readiness for responsibility. Jesus beginning His ministry at this age aligns with the cultural expectations of leadership and spiritual authority. It also fulfills the typology of the priesthood, as priests began their service at thirty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>).<p><b>He was regarded as the son of Joseph,</b><br>Though Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), He was legally recognized as Joseph's son, which was important for His legal standing and fulfillment of Messianic prophecies. Joseph's lineage connects Jesus to the house of David, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. This legal recognition also emphasizes Jesus' full humanity and His identification with the human family.<p><b>the son of Heli,</b><br>The genealogy presented here is often understood to be that of Mary, with Heli being her father. This differs from the genealogy in Matthew, which traces Joseph's lineage. The mention of Heli highlights the dual nature of Jesus' heritage, both legal and biological, and underscores His fulfillment of the Davidic line through both parents. This dual genealogy supports the claim of Jesus as the legitimate heir to the promises given to David, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, regarded as the Son of God and the Messiah.

from that point He &#8220;went throughout Galilee, teaching&#8230; and healing&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>).<p>- Ministry here is diakonia&#8212;a life of service culminating in the cross (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Luke ties the start of that service to a precise moment, underscoring God&#8217;s perfect timing (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p>- Every Gospel event that follows&#8212;preaching, miracles, discipleship&#8212;flows from this deliberate beginning (<a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14-15</a>; <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was regarded as the son of Joseph</b><p>- &#8220;Regarded&#8221; (or &#8220;supposed,&#8221; <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>) acknowledges public perception: townspeople knew Jesus as Joseph&#8217;s boy (<a href="/john/6-42.htm">John 6:42</a>; <a href="/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>).<p>- Yet Luke has already affirmed the virgin birth (<a href="/luke/1-34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>; 2:7). Jesus is legally Joseph&#8217;s son&#8212;thus heir to David&#8212;while remaining divinely conceived, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-25</a>.<p>- Scripture holds both truths together: legitimate earthly lineage through Joseph, sinless divine origin through the Holy Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Heli</b><p>- From Joseph the list moves to Heli, tracing backward through Nathan to David (<a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a>) and ultimately to Adam (<a href="/luke/3-38.htm">Luke 3:38</a>).<p>- Early believers understood Heli to be Mary&#8217;s father; Joseph, as son-in-law, is counted &#8220;son of Heli&#8221; by marriage, a common genealogical practice that keeps Mary&#8217;s Davidic bloodline intact.<p>- Thus Luke shows Jesus descended from David biologically through Mary (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>) and legally through Joseph&#8212;fulfilling <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and confirming every messianic promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a> roots Jesus&#8217; public mission in real time, real family, and real prophecy. Around age thirty, the incarnate Son deliberately steps into priest-like service, outwardly known as Joseph&#8217;s heir yet truly the virgin-born Son of God. The verse anchors the Gospel&#8217;s unfolding story to history and genealogy, assuring us that the Redeemer who now ministers in our lives is the very Messiah Scripture promised from the beginning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Began to be about thirty years of age.</span>--At this age the Levites entered on their full work (<a href="/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-30.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old shall you number them, every one that enters into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-35.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 4:35</a>), a kind of probationary period beginning at twenty-five (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>) or even, in later times, when their work was lighter, at twenty (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-27.htm" title="For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:">1Chronicles 23:27</a>). No age was fixed for the beginning of the priesthood, nor of the prophet's work; but it may fairly be inferred that thirty was looked on as the time when manhood reached its completeness, and we may therefore believe that our Lord waited in patient humility till that age had been attained before entering on the work of His public ministry.<p><span class= "bld">Being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph.</span>--We have here to deal with the many questions which rise out of a comparison of this genealogy with that in Matthew 1.
