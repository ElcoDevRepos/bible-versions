In the context of <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>, Jesus had just declared His messianic mission in the synagogue at Nazareth, which led to the crowd's anger. The ability to pass through the crowd unharmed suggests divine protection and authority. This moment can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which Jesus read earlier in the chapter, emphasizing His anointed mission. The crowd's inability to harm Him underscores His divine nature and the fact that His time had not yet come, as seen in other instances like <a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a> and <a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>, where Jesus eludes capture because His hour had not yet arrived.<p><b>and went on His way</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' determination and purpose in His ministry. Despite the rejection in Nazareth, He continues His mission, undeterred by opposition. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry, where He consistently moves forward with His divine purpose, as seen throughout the Gospels. The phrase also connects to the idea of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who leads and guides with authority and purpose, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-18</a>. His journey is not just a physical movement but a spiritual mission to bring salvation, as prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is demonstrating His divine authority and control over the situation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people in the synagogue at Nazareth who were filled with wrath and attempted to throw Jesus off a cliff.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The town where Jesus grew up and where this event takes place.

There is nothing hinted here that our Lord rendered himself invisible, or that he smote his enemies with a temporary blindness. He probably quietly overawed these angry men with his calm self-possession, so that they forbore their cruel purpose, and thus he passed through their midst, and left Nazareth - as far as we know - forever. The foregoing is probably the same visit very briefly alluded to by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/13-54.htm">Matthew 13:54-58</a>) and by St. Mark (<a href="/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>), in both Gospels related in unchronological order. Most likely they were aware of the incident, but ignorant of the exact place it held among the early events of the Master's life. St. Luke, who gives it with far greater detail, inserts it evidently in its right place. Is it not at least probable that St. Luke derived his accurate knowledge of this Nazareth incident from Mary, or from some of her intimate circle, from whom he procured the information which he embodied in the earlier chapters of his Gospel? She, and others of her friends, would be likely to have preserved some accurate memories of this painful visit of Jesus to his old home. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
