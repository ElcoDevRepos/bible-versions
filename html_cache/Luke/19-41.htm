Jerusalem, the city of David, is central to Jewish identity and worship, housing the Temple, the heart of Jewish religious life. Jesus' approach signifies the culmination of His earthly ministry and the fulfillment of His mission. The city is also the site of many prophetic events, including those foretold by prophets like Isaiah and Zechariah, who spoke of a coming Messiah. Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is a fulfillment of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, where the King comes to Zion.<p><b>and saw the city,</b><br>Jerusalem is not just a geographical location but a symbol of the Jewish people and their covenant with God. The city is often depicted in the Old Testament as a place of divine presence and future hope. Jesus' view of the city would have included the Temple, a place of worship and sacrifice, which He had previously cleansed. The sight of Jerusalem evokes a deep emotional response from Jesus, highlighting His connection to the city and its people.<p><b>He wept over it</b><br>Jesus' weeping is a profound expression of His compassion and sorrow for Jerusalem. This is one of the few instances in the Gospels where Jesus is described as weeping, indicating the depth of His lament. His tears reflect His awareness of the impending destruction of the city, which would occur in AD 70, as well as the spiritual blindness and rejection of His message by its inhabitants. This moment echoes the lament of the prophets, such as Jeremiah, who mourned over the fate of Jerusalem. Jesus' tears also reveal His role as a compassionate Savior, who grieves over the lost and desires their repentance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, the Messiah, who is approaching Jerusalem.

It was a very different view to what the traveller of the present day would see from the same spot. Though Jerusalem, when Jesus Christ was teaching on earth, was subject to the stranger Herodian, and the Herodian to the great Italian power, yet the beauty and glory of the city were remarkable. Still glittered in the midst of the great city that "mass of gold and snow" known as the temple. The far-extending suburbs were covered with the gardens and palaces of the wealthy Jews. But the mighty memories which hung so thickly round the sacred city and the glorious house of God after all constituted its chief charm. What might not that city have been! what splendid and far-reaching work might it not have done l and now the cup of its iniquities was just brimming over; only a few more short years, and a silence the most awful would brood over the shapeless ruins of what was once Jerusalem and her house on Zion, the joy of the whole earth. <span class="cmt_word">And wept over it</span>. No merely silent tears of mute sorrow, but <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he wept aloud. All the insults and the sufferings of the Passion were powerless to elicit from the Man of sorrows that expression of intense grief which the thought of the ruin of the loved city called forth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] approached [Jerusalem]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#947;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;ngisen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1448.htm">Strong's 1448: </a> </span><span class="str2">Trans: I bring near; intrans: I come near, approach.
