The look from Jesus is significant, as it is not one of condemnation but of profound understanding and compassion. This glance serves as a reminder of Jesus' earlier prophecy about Peter's denial, highlighting Jesus' omniscience. The setting is likely the courtyard of the high priest's house, a place of tension and fear for the disciples. The look signifies a personal connection between Jesus and Peter, emphasizing the relational aspect of Jesus' ministry. It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' earlier prediction, underscoring His role as a prophet.<p><b>Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him:</b><br>Peter's remembrance is a moment of deep personal conviction and realization. It signifies the Holy Spirit's work in bringing Jesus' words to Peter's mind, illustrating the Spirit's role in guiding believers to truth. This remembrance is crucial for Peter's later repentance and restoration. It also serves as a narrative device to show the fulfillment of prophecy and Jesus' foreknowledge. The cultural context of memory in Jewish tradition often involves a call to action or repentance, which is evident in Peter's subsequent behavior.<p><b>&#8220;Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy, spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, is a specific prediction that underscores Jesus' divine knowledge. The rooster crowing is a time marker, indicating the early morning hours, a common time for such events in the ancient Near East. The threefold denial is significant, as the number three often symbolizes completeness or emphasis in biblical literature. This denial contrasts with Peter's earlier bold declarations of loyalty, highlighting human weakness and the need for divine grace. The fulfillment of this prophecy serves as a testament to Jesus' authority and the reliability of His words. It also foreshadows Peter's eventual restoration and leadership in the early church, demonstrating the transformative power of forgiveness and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being denied by Peter.

As he was sitting in the porch, our Lord must have looked on the disciple as He was being led from Annas to the more public trial before the Sanhedrin. The form in which the fact is narrated, "<span class= "ital">the Lord</span> turned," points, probably, as in other instances, to its having been gathered by St. Luke from his informants at a time when that mode of naming Him had become habitual; and possibly in answer to inquiries, natural in one who sought to analyse the motives that led to action, as to what had brought about the change that led Peter, as in a moment, from the curses of denial to the tears of penitence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter</span>. As he was passing from the interrogation before Caiaphas to be examined before the Sanhedrin assembled in solemn council, he heard his servant's well-known voice raised and accompanied with oaths and curses, assuring the by-standers he had no connection with and knew nothing of Jesus of Nazareth. Then, as he passed, the Master turned and looked on his old friend, that disciple who so lately had declared that even if all others deserted the Lord, he never would! The glance of Jesus was full of the tenderest pity; it was not angry, only sorrowful; but it recalled Peter to his better, nobler self. SS. Matthew and Mark (Peter's own Gospel) record how, when he heard the cock crow, which St. Luke tells us happened as our Lord turned to look on the recreant disciple, he remembered all, and burst into bitter weeping. We meet him again on the Resurrection morning in company with St. John (<a href="/john/20-3.htm">John 20:3</a>), whence, it would seem, that in his bitter sorrow he had turned to his old friend, who had probably heard his denial. St. John, who briefly in his narrative touches upon the "denial," omits to mention the repentance, but, according to his custom, specially illustrates it in the scene by the lake (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>, and following verses). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-61.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
