In biblical context, darkness often symbolizes secrecy or evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The idea that God will bring hidden things to light is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, where Paul speaks of God revealing the motives of the heart. This serves as a warning against hypocrisy and secret sins, reminding believers that nothing is truly hidden from God.<p><b>will be heard in the daylight</b><br>Daylight represents truth, openness, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). The transition from darkness to light signifies the exposure of hidden deeds and words. Historically, public proclamations were made during the day when people were active and could hear the message. This phrase assures that truth will ultimately prevail, aligning with the biblical theme of God's justice and righteousness being revealed (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>).<p><b>and what you have whispered in the inner rooms</b><br>Inner rooms refer to private, secluded areas within a house, often used for confidential conversations. In ancient Jewish homes, these rooms were places of privacy, away from the public eye. The cultural context highlights the contrast between private and public life, warning against duplicity. This phrase underscores the futility of trying to conceal actions or intentions from God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>, which states that nothing is hidden from His sight.<p><b>will be proclaimed from the housetops</b><br>In ancient times, housetops were flat and used for various activities, including public announcements. This imagery suggests that what is hidden will be made known to all, reinforcing the theme of divine justice and truth. The proclamation from housetops symbolizes the widespread dissemination of truth, akin to the prophetic declarations found in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>). This serves as a call to integrity and transparency, reflecting the nature of Jesus Christ as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowd, teaching them about the importance of integrity and the inevitability of truth being revealed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for the challenges of spreading the Gospel and living a life of transparency and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/luke/12.htm">Luke 12</a> includes Jesus warning against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, which serves as a backdrop for His teaching on truth and integrity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_rooms.htm">Inner Rooms</a></b><br>Refers to private spaces where conversations were thought to be confidential, symbolizing hidden or secretive actions and words.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/housetops.htm">Housetops</a></b><br>In ancient times, rooftops were places where public announcements were made, symbolizing the eventual public revelation of all things.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_speech_and_action.htm">Integrity in Speech and Action</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to live with integrity, ensuring that our private words and actions align with our public testimony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_truth.htm">The Inevitability of Truth</a></b><br>This passage reminds us that truth will ultimately prevail.

He has just warned, &#8220;There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>). His point is clear: even if words are hidden from human ears, they are never hidden from God (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>). In <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1&#8211;10</a> Ananias and Sapphira thought their deception stayed in the dark; God exposed it before the whole church. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a> reminds us, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be heard in the daylight</b><p>Daylight represents open, public view. God brings concealed words into undeniable visibility, whether in this life or at the final judgment (<a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>). Jesus fulfills His promise: truth outlasts secrecy. The disciples, once timid in the upper room (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>), will boldly preach in broad daylight at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14&#8211;21</a>).

There is, it will be noted, a difference of the same character as in the last verse. As recorded in St. Matthew, it is "What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light." The disciples were warned of their responsibility and duty as hearers, bound to teach publicly what had been heard in secret. Here they are told of their responsibility as teachers. Every word, however secret, spoken in darkness, in the closet or cabinet, which was the symbol of secresy (see Note on <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm" title="But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:6</a>); every whisper of false security or groundless fear, spoken in the ear of sinner or of penitent, would one day be made manifest, as in the presence of men and angels.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hosa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
