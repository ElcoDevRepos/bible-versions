The disciples' reaction reflects a common human tendency to form exclusive groups, even within religious contexts. Jesus' response emphasizes inclusivity in the mission of spreading the Gospel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using unexpected people to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, who was a non-Israelite used by God to deliver His people.<p><b>&#8220;for whoever is not against you&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of unity among those who work towards the same divine goals, even if they are not part of the immediate group of disciples. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, there were various sects and groups, such as the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, each with distinct beliefs and practices. Jesus' statement challenges the exclusivity of these groups by suggesting that the work of God transcends human boundaries. This idea is echoed in <a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>, where Paul advises believers not to judge the servants of another master.<p><b>&#8220;is for you.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus concludes with a principle of alliance, suggesting that those who are not actively opposing the disciples' mission are, in effect, supporting it. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God&#8217;s kingdom being open to all who align with His purposes, regardless of their background or affiliation. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the inclusion of Gentiles into the early Christian church, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with the conversion of Cornelius. It underscores the theme of the universal call to salvation and the breaking down of barriers, as Paul writes in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing guidance to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unnamed_man_casting_out_demons.htm">Unnamed Man Casting Out Demons</a></b><br>A person not part of the immediate group of disciples but performing works in Jesus' name.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_broader_context_of_jesus'_ministry.htm">The Broader Context of Jesus' Ministry</a></b><br>This event occurs during Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, where He is teaching and preparing His disciples for His impending death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ's_mission.htm">Unity in Christ's Mission</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of unity among His followers.

Their impulse was protective, but Jesus calls a halt to gate-keeping.<p>&#8226; Parallel scene: &#8220;Do not stop him. No one who does a miracle in My name can in the next moment speak evil of Me&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-39.htm">Mark 9:39</a>). Jesus consistently guards space for genuine, if unconventional, ministry.<p>&#8226; We are reminded of Gamaliel&#8217;s counsel: &#8220;If their purpose or endeavor is of God, you will not be able to stop them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38-39</a>). Attempting to choke off Spirit-led work risks opposing God Himself.<p>&#8226; Application bullets:<p>&#8211; Test fruit, not affiliation (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Celebrate any advance of Christ&#8217;s name, even if it is outside our circle.<p>&#8211; Resist jealousy or territorialism; the harvest is the Lord&#8217;s (<a href="/luke/10-2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus replied,</b><p>&#8226; The Master answers quickly, cutting through the disciples&#8217; narrow instincts. His word settles the discussion; His authority defines acceptable service (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; reply exposes a heart issue: pride. They feared lost status, not doctrinal error. Compare His earlier lesson on child-like humility (<a href="/luke/9-46.htm">Luke 9:46-48</a>).<p>&#8226; His gentle correction models shepherd leadership&#8212;strong yet patient (<a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for whoever is not against you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Whoever is not with Me is against Me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-23.htm">Luke 11:23</a>) may seem opposite, yet both statements urge clear allegiance. Here the accent falls on recognizing true allies even when methods differ.<p>&#8226; Moses faced a similar moment: Eldad and Medad prophesied outside the camp, and Joshua wanted them silenced. Moses answered, &#8220;Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-26.htm">Numbers 11:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Unity does not erase diversity.

He exposes pride, widens their vision of the kingdom, and calls us to welcome diverse yet Christ-honoring service. The verse invites today&#8217;s believers to value unity, celebrate authentic work done for Jesus, and let the Spirit, not personal turf, set the boundaries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us</span>. The older authorities, manuscripts, and the more venerable versions here read for the last clause, "He that is not against you is for you." Exegetically as well as critically this amended reading is to be preferred. The offence of the stranger, if it were an offence, was not against Jesus, whose Name had evidently been used reverently and with faith, but against the disciples, whose rights and privileges were presumably infringed upon. The Master's reply contained a broad and far-reaching truth. No earthly society, however holy, would be able exclusively to claim the Divine powers inseparably connected with a true and faithful use of his Name. This is the grand and massive answer which stretches over a history of eighteen centuries, and which will possibly extend over many yet to come; the answer which gives an ample reason why noble Christian work is done whether emanating from Churches bearing the name of Protestant, or Roman, or Greek. THE SO-CALLED JOURNEYINGS TOWARDS JERUSALEM. The great characteristic feature in St. Luke's Gospel, distinguishing it especially from the other two synoptical Gospels of SS.
