Their nickname reflects their zealous and fiery nature, which is evident in this passage. The context here is Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, passing through a Samaritan village that did not welcome Him (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-53</a>). The tension between Jews and Samaritans was longstanding, rooted in historical and religious differences dating back to the Assyrian conquest and the subsequent intermarriage of Israelites with foreigners (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24-41</a>).<p><b>they asked,</b><br>The disciples' question reveals their misunderstanding of Jesus' mission at this point. They were still learning the nature of Jesus' kingdom, which was not one of earthly power or retribution but of love and forgiveness. This moment is a teaching opportunity for Jesus, highlighting the contrast between human impulses and divine purpose.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven</b><br>The reference to calling down fire from heaven echoes the actions of the prophet Elijah, who called down fire on the soldiers of King Ahaziah (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a>). This allusion suggests that James and John saw themselves as continuing the prophetic tradition, wielding divine power against opposition. However, Jesus' response to their request underscores a new covenant approach, emphasizing mercy over judgment.<p><b>to consume them?&#8221;</b><br>The desire to consume the Samaritans with fire reflects a common expectation of the Messiah as a conquering figure who would vanquish His enemies. This expectation was prevalent among Jews of the time, who anticipated a political and military leader. Jesus, however, came to save, not to destroy (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>). His rebuke of James and John (in the following verse) aligns with His teachings on loving one's enemies and turning the other cheek (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39, 44</a>). This incident foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Gospel, which would later be preached in Samaria (<a href="/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5-25</a>), demonstrating the transformative power of Christ's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_and_john.htm">James and John</a></b><br>Known as the "Sons of Thunder," these two disciples of Jesus are known for their zealous and sometimes impulsive nature.

Did not such a people deserve a punishment like that which Elijah had inflicted on the messengers of Ahaziah (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty.

Possibly, what these two had lately witnessed on the Transfiguration mount had deepened their veneration for their Lord, and caused them the more bitterly to resent an insult levelled at him. So they prayed him - him whom they had so lately seen radiant with the awful fire of heaven - prayed him to call that fire down, and so wither in a moment those impious despisers of his gracious goodness. The words, "even as Elias did," form a very appropriate historical instance, but they are of doubtful authenticity - the older authorities have them not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
