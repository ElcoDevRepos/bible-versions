His diet, as described in other scriptures, consisted of locusts and wild honey, emphasizing his separation from worldly pleasures and dedication to his mission. This lifestyle aligns with the Nazarite vow, which included abstaining from wine and strong drink, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>. John's choice to live in the wilderness and his simple diet were symbolic of his call to repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. His lifestyle was a stark contrast to the religious leaders of the time, who often indulged in the comforts of life.<p><b>and you say, &#8216;He has a demon!&#8217;</b><br>The accusation that John had a demon reflects the rejection and misunderstanding he faced from the religious leaders and some of the people. This statement highlights the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart prevalent among those who refused to accept his message. In the cultural context, attributing someone's behavior to demonic influence was a way to discredit and dismiss them. This accusation parallels the rejection Jesus Himself faced, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18-19</a>, where both John and Jesus are criticized for their differing approaches.

He appeared in the wilderness with a singular mission: &#8220;Prepare the way for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>).<p>- By mentioning John, Jesus reminds His listeners that God had already provided unmistakable evidence of His work among them (<a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6-8</a>). Rejection of John therefore exposes a heart problem, not a lack of revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Neither eating bread nor drinking wine</b><p>- John practiced an austere lifestyle (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>) that underscored his call to repentance. His fasting and abstinence aligned with the Nazarite-like devotion he embraced from birth (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>).<p>- This simplicity was a deliberate contrast to the self-indulgence of many religious leaders (<a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-7</a>). It also highlighted the urgency of his message: &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>).<p>- Jesus Himself later explained that John &#8220;came in the way of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-32.htm">Matthew 21:32</a>). His lifestyle was not asceticism for its own sake but a living sermon calling Israel back to holiness (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You say, &#8216;He has a demon!&#8217;</b><p>- Despite John&#8217;s integrity, the crowds and leaders dismissed him with slander (<a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>). Labeling him &#8220;demon-possessed&#8221; allowed them to sidestep conviction (<a href="/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48</a>).<p>- This accusation reveals a pattern: whenever God&#8217;s messenger confronted sin, the unrepentant responded with ridicule (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>; <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51-52</a>).<p>- Jesus contrasts the people&#8217;s verdict on John with their later accusation against Himself&#8212;calling Him &#8220;a glutton and a drunkard&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-34.htm">Luke 7:34</a>). Their inconsistent judgments expose willful unbelief rather than legitimate concern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/7-33.htm">Luke 7:33</a> highlights the tragic irony of Israel rejecting God&#8217;s prophet. John&#8217;s divinely ordered arrival, his disciplined life, and his uncompromising call to repentance should have drawn people to God. Instead, many dismissed him as demonized. Jesus uses this moment to underscore that rejection of God&#8217;s messengers stems not from a lack of evidence but from hardened hearts.

"We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour: how is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!" (Wisd. 5:4, 5). We. may be quite sure that "in the fiery furnace God walked with his servant, so that his spirit was not harmed, and having thus annealed his nature to the utmost that this earth can do, he took him hastily away and placed him among the glorified in heaven" (Irving, quoted by Farrar). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
