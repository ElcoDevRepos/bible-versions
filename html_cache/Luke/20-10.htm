In the context of a vineyard, it represents the expected time of fruitfulness and reward for labor. Biblically, harvests were times of celebration and thanksgiving, as seen in the Feast of Harvest (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). This phrase sets the stage for the expectation of rightful returns from the vineyard, which is a metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).<p><b>he sent a servant to the tenants</b><br>The sending of a servant reflects the practice of landowners who would send representatives to collect their due. In the parable, the servant represents the prophets sent by God to Israel. Historically, prophets were often rejected or mistreated by the people they were sent to (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>). This action underscores God's persistent attempts to reach His people despite their resistance.<p><b>to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard</b><br>The "share of the fruit" symbolizes the spiritual fruits or righteousness that God expected from Israel. The vineyard is a common biblical metaphor for God's people (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). The expectation of fruitfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God desires justice and righteousness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). This phrase highlights the rightful claim of God over His people and their spiritual output.<p><b>But the tenants beat the servant</b><br>The tenants' violent reaction represents Israel's historical mistreatment of the prophets. This reflects a pattern of rebellion and rejection of God's messengers (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). The beating of the servant is a foreshadowing of the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Son, later in the parable.<p><b>and sent him away empty-handed</b><br>Sending the servant away empty-handed signifies the complete rejection of God's message and authority. This act of defiance illustrates the tenants' refusal to acknowledge the landowner's rights, paralleling Israel's rejection of God's sovereignty. It also prefigures the rejection of Christ, who came to His own, but His own did not receive Him (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This phrase emphasizes the tenants' hardened hearts and the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard_owner.htm">Vineyard Owner</a></b><br>Represents God, who has established His people and expects them to bear fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vine-growers.htm">Vine-growers (Tenants)</a></b><br>Symbolize the religious leaders of Israel who were entrusted with the care of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>Represents the prophets sent by God to call His people to repentance and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes Israel, God's chosen people, who were expected to produce spiritual fruit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_time.htm">Harvest Time</a></b><br>Represents the time when God expects to see the results of His investment in His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_persistence.htm">God's Patience and Persistence</a></b><br>God repeatedly sends His messengers to call His people back to Him, demonstrating His patience and desire for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_leadership.htm">Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Those in spiritual leadership are accountable to God for how they care for His people and must lead with integrity and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_god's_messengers.htm">Rejection of God's Messengers</a></b><br>The rejection of the prophets is a warning against hard-heartedness and the refusal to heed God's call.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_as_evidence_of_faith.htm">Fruitfulness as Evidence of Faith</a></b><br>God expects His people to produce spiritual fruit, which is evidence of a genuine relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_accountability.htm">Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>There is a time of reckoning when God will hold His people accountable for their response to His call and their stewardship of His gifts.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_20_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 20:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_20_10_God_s_patience_shown_how.htm">How does Luke 20:10 illustrate God's patience with humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_mistreatment_show_rejecting_God.htm">What does the servant's mistreatment reveal about human rejection of God's messengers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Identify_respect_God_s_servants_today.htm">How can we identify and respect God's "servants" in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Luke_20_10_to_OT_prophets_fate.htm">Compare Luke 20:10 with Old Testament prophets' treatment.

The parable reminds us that God&#8217;s patience does not cancel His right to examine lives (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), and that a day of reckoning always arrives (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he sent a servant</b><p>The owner&#8217;s first move is gracious&#8212;He does not arrive in wrath but sends a representative. Jesus is pointing to the line of prophets God dispatched to Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). The servant&#8217;s presence is tangible evidence of the owner&#8217;s continued concern. In the same way, each prophetic messenger revealed God&#8217;s ongoing pursuit (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the tenants</b><p>The tenants symbolize Israel&#8217;s leaders, entrusted with God&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).

Responsibility in God&#8217;s kingdom is always delegated; accountability is never forfeited.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard</b><p>Fruit belongs to the owner. God seeks righteousness, justice, and obedience (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). Jesus&#8217; earlier parable of the fig tree without figs (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>) sounded the same warning: profession without product is unacceptable. Genuine faith must yield visible fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the tenants beat the servant</b><p>The violence depicts Israel&#8217;s historic rejection of the prophets&#8212;Elijah hunted (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>), Jeremiah thrown into a cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), Zechariah stoned (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>).

After the pains and care bestowed upon the vineyard, that is, after the many mighty works done in Israel's behalf, the Lord of hosts looked for <span class="accented">fruits</span> of gratitude and fidelity in some proportion to the mighty favours which it had received from him. The people were intended to be the example to, and the educators of, the world, and, instead of carrying out these high functions, they lived the poor selfish life so sadly depicted in the long story contained in the historical and prophetical books. "He looked that it [his vineyard] should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes" (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">the husbandmen beat him, and</span> sent him <span class="cmt_word">away empty. And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</span> These represent the prophets, those faithful servants of the Lord, whose toils and trials and fate are painted in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11.) in such glowing and eloquent language. <span class="accented">And again he sent.</span> In vers. 11 and 12, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, literally, "he added to send another" - a Hebraism. This shows St. Luke here based his account on a Hebrew (Aramaic) original. Professor Bruce well puts the thoughts which possessed the wicked husbandmen thus: "When the servants came for fruit, they were simply surprised. 'Fruit! did you say? We have occupied the position of vine-dressers, and have duly drawn our wages: what more do you want?' Such was the actual fact in regard to the spiritual heads of Israel. They were men who never thought of fruit, but only of the honour and privilege of being entrusted with the keeping of the vineyard. They were triflers, men utterly devoid of earnestness, and the practical purpose of the property committed to their charge they habitually forgot. Generally speaking, they had utterly lost sight of the end of Israel's calling." Their anger flamed forth when accredited messengers of the Lord visited them and reminded them of their forgotten duties; they vented their furious wrath by persecuting some and killing others of these faithful men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At harvest time,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(kair&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2540.htm">Strong's 2540: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fitting season, season, opportunity, occasion, time.
