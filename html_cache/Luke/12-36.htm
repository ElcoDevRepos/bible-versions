In biblical times, servants were expected to be attentive and prepared for their master's needs at any moment. This reflects the Christian call to live in a state of spiritual readiness and service, echoing the teachings of Jesus in other parables such as the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>waiting for their master</b><br>The concept of waiting for the master underscores the anticipation of Christ's return. In the cultural context of the first century, a servant's duty was to be prepared for the master's arrival at any time. This parallels the eschatological theme found throughout the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live in expectation of the Second Coming of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-6</a>).<p><b>to return from the wedding banquet</b><br>The wedding banquet symbolizes a time of joy and celebration, often used in Scripture to represent the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>). The master's return from such an event suggests a time of fulfillment and completion. This imagery connects to the prophetic vision of the marriage supper of the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>, where Christ is united with His Church.<p><b>so that when he comes and knocks</b><br>The act of knocking signifies the master's desire to enter and be welcomed. In <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, Jesus uses similar language, indicating His desire for fellowship with believers. The knocking also implies an element of surprise, reinforcing the need for constant readiness, as the exact time of the master's return is unknown (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>).<p><b>they can open the door for him at once</b><br>Opening the door immediately reflects the servant's preparedness and eagerness to welcome the master. This readiness is a metaphor for spiritual vigilance and faithfulness. The immediacy of the action suggests a heart that is attuned to the master's presence, reminiscent of the wise virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, who were prepared for the bridegroom's arrival.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Represent believers who are expected to be vigilant and prepared for the return of their master, symbolizing Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes Jesus Christ, who will return at an unexpected time, and whose servants must be ready to receive Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wedding_banquet.htm">Wedding Banquet</a></b><br>A metaphor for the joyous occasion of Christ's return, often associated with the marriage supper of the Lamb in Revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/door.htm">Door</a></b><br>Represents the readiness and willingness of believers to welcome Christ upon His return.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/return.htm">Return</a></b><br>The second coming of Christ, an event that believers are to anticipate with preparedness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_and_readiness.htm">Vigilance and Readiness</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in a state of constant readiness for Christ's return, maintaining a lifestyle that reflects His teachings and commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_service.htm">Faithful Service</a></b><br>Like the servants in the parable, Christians are to be diligent in their service to God, using their gifts and resources to further His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_anticipation.htm">Joyful Anticipation</a></b><br>The return of Christ is a joyous event, akin to a wedding banquet, and believers should look forward to it with hope and excitement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_response.htm">Immediate Response</a></b><br>The servants' readiness to open the door immediately upon the master's return highlights the importance of being spiritually prepared at all times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_alertness.htm">Spiritual Alertness</a></b><br>Just as the servants are alert to the master's return, Christians must remain spiritually alert, discerning the times and living in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_12_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 12:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_await_Christ_like_servants.htm">How can we be like "servants waiting" for Christ's return in Luke 12:36?
