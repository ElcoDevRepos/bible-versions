This period of three days can symbolize completeness or a significant event in biblical terms, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus after three days. It also highlights the diligence and concern of His earthly parents in searching for Him.<p><b>they found Him in the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts refer to the outer areas of the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and learning for the Jewish people. The Temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, and finding Jesus there underscores His connection to His Father's house. This setting also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where the Lord is prophesied to come to His temple.<p><b>sitting among the teachers</b><br>Sitting among the teachers indicates Jesus' position as a student or participant in a rabbinical discussion. In Jewish culture, rabbis and teachers would gather in the temple courts to discuss the Torah and other religious matters. Jesus' presence among them at such a young age demonstrates His wisdom and understanding, which surpasses that of a typical child.<p><b>listening to them</b><br>Listening to the teachers shows Jesus' respect for the Jewish tradition of learning and His willingness to engage with the religious leaders of His time. This act of listening is significant, as it reflects the importance of humility and the pursuit of wisdom, which are valued traits in biblical teachings.<p><b>and asking them questions</b><br>Asking questions was a common method of teaching and learning in Jewish culture, often used by rabbis to provoke thought and deeper understanding. Jesus' questions would have been insightful, reflecting His divine wisdom and knowledge. This interaction foreshadows His future role as a teacher and His ability to challenge and enlighten those around Him, as seen throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>At twelve years old, Jesus is found in the temple, demonstrating His wisdom and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_joseph.htm">Mary and Joseph</a></b><br>Jesus' earthly parents who, after realizing He was missing, searched for Him and found Him in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The location in Jerusalem where Jesus was found, a central place of worship and teaching for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/teachers.htm">Teachers</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders and scholars who were engaged in discussion with Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_festival.htm">Passover Festival</a></b><br>The event that brought Jesus and His family to Jerusalem, a significant Jewish feast commemorating the Exodus from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_wisdom.htm">The Importance of Seeking Wisdom</a></b><br>Jesus, even as a child, sought wisdom and understanding.

The "doctors" or teachers--famous "doctors of the Law" (<a href="/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;">Acts 5:34</a>)--sat "in Moses' seat;" the older students on a low bench; the younger on the ground, literally "at the feet" of their instructor. The relation between master and scholar was often one of affectionate reverence and sympathy, and was expressed by one of the famous scribes in a saying worth remembering, "I have learnt much from the Rabbis, my teachers; I have learnt more from the Rabbis, my colleagues; but from my scholars I have learnt most of all." It is interesting to think that among the doctors then present may have been the venerable Hillel, then verging upon his hundredth year; his son and successor, Simeon; his grandson, the then youthful Gamaliel; Jonathan, the writer of the Chaldee Targum or Paraphrase of the Sacred Books; and Shammai, the rival of Hillel, who "bound" where the latter "loosed."<p><span class= "bld">Both hearing them, and asking them questions.</span>--The method of teaching was, we see, essentially and reciprocally catechetical. The kind of questions current in the schools would include such as, What is the great commandment of the Law? What may or may not be done on the Sabbath? How is such a precept to be paraphrased; what is its true meaning? As the Targum of Jonathan included the books of Joshua, Judges 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve Minor Prophets, the questions may probably have turned also on the meaning of prophecies, the expectations of the Christ, and the like. The legends of the Apocryphal Gospels make the wisdom of the child Jesus take a wide range over astronomy and other sciences.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple.</span> According to the common way of reckoning among the Hebrews, this expression, "after three days," probably means "on the third day." One day was consumed in the usual short pilgrim-journey. His absence at first would excite no attention; on the second, as they missed him still, they sought him in the various pilgrim-companies; and on the day following they found him in the temple courts, with the doctors of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions</span>. In the temple enclosure, says the Talmud, there were three synagogues - one at the gate of the court of the Gentiles, another at the entrance of the court of the Israelites, a third in the south-east part of the inner court: it was in these that the rabbis expounded the Law. Among the famous doctors, or rabbis, then living and teaching in Jerusalem, were the famous Hillel, then very aged, verging, we are told, on his hundredth year; his almost equally illustrious rival, Shammai; Gamaliel, the master of Saul of Tarsus; Jonathan, the compiler of the Chaldee Paraphrase of the sacred books; Simeon, the son and successor of Hillel; Nicodemus, who, some years afterwards, came to Jesus by night, and, when the end was come, reverently assisted in laying the King's Son with all honor in his tomb in Joseph of Arimathaea's garden. We may, with great probability, assume that amongst those "doctors" whom the Boy questioned at that Passover Feast, some if not all of these well-known men were sitting. The apocryphal Gospels, as usual, profess to give us details where the true story is reverently silent. The 'Gospel of Thomas' (second century), for instance, tells us that Jesus, when on the road to Nazareth, returned of his own accord to Jerusalem, and amazed the rabbis of the temple by his solution of the hardest and most difficult questions of the Law and the prophets. In an Arabic Gospel of somewhat later date than that of Thomas, we find the Boy even teaching the astronomers the secrets of their own difficult study. Probably Stier's simple words approach the nearest to the truth here, when he suggests that his questions were "the pure questions of innocence and of truth, which keenly and deeply penetrated into the confused errors of the rabbinical teaching." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">after</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">three</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(treis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5140.htm">Strong's 5140: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three.
