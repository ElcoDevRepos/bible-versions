Jesus frequently uses this title to emphasize both His humanity and His divine mission. It highlights His role as the representative of humanity and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<p><b>came</b><br>This indicates the purpose and intentionality of Jesus' incarnation. It reflects the divine mission and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The coming of Jesus was prophesied in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, and His arrival marks the pivotal moment in salvation history.<p><b>to seek</b><br>The act of seeking implies initiative and effort. Jesus actively pursues those who are lost, demonstrating God's love and desire for reconciliation with humanity. This echoes the parables of the lost sheep, coin, and son in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, illustrating God's relentless pursuit of sinners.<p><b>and to save</b><br>Salvation is central to Jesus' mission. His work on the cross provides the means for redemption and reconciliation with God. This phrase underscores the necessity of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, to accomplish salvation for humanity.<p><b>the lost.</b><br>The term "lost" refers to those who are spiritually estranged from God, encompassing all of humanity due to sin. It highlights the universal need for salvation and the inclusivity of Jesus' mission. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's desire to restore His creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>, where God promises to seek out and rescue His scattered sheep.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," a title that emphasizes both His humanity and His divine mission. This title is rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it is associated with authority and an everlasting kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lost.htm">The Lost</a></b><br>This term refers to those who are spiritually lost, separated from God due to sin. In the context of <a href="/bsb/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>, it specifically relates to Zacchaeus, a tax collector who was considered a sinner by society.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The city where Jesus encounters Zacchaeus. Jericho is significant as a place of transformation and redemption in this account.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zacchaeus.htm">Zacchaeus</a></b><br>A tax collector who climbs a sycamore tree to see Jesus. His encounter with Jesus leads to his repentance and salvation, illustrating the mission of Jesus to save the lost.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Represents societal norms and judgments, often critical of Jesus' association with sinners like Zacchaeus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_mission_of_jesus.htm">Understanding the Mission of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' primary mission was to seek and save the lost, emphasizing His role as Savior. This mission is central to the Gospel message and should be the focus of Christian life and ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_being_'lost'.htm">The Nature of Being 'Lost'</a></b><br>Being lost is a spiritual condition characterized by separation from God. Recognizing our own lostness is the first step toward salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inclusivity_of_salvation.htm">The Inclusivity of Salvation</a></b><br>Jesus' interaction with Zacchaeus shows that salvation is available to all, regardless of social status or past sins. The Gospel is inclusive and transformative.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_jesus'_call.htm">Responding to Jesus' Call</a></b><br>Like Zacchaeus, we must respond to Jesus' call with repentance and a willingness to change.

Then the loving purpose of the Christ had for its object the "little child," as yet untouched by the world's offences (<a href="/matthew/18-2.htm" title="And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the middle of them,">Matthew 18:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-11.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.">Matthew 18:11</a>): now it rested on the publican, whose manhood had been marred by them. The same law of work is reproduced in a more emphatic form. There it had been that He "came to save:" here it is that He came to "seek" as well.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost</span>. A quiet rebuke to the Pharisees and priests and their followers, who would limit the redeemed. Surely the "publicans" and the great tempted mass of mankind needed him more than the happy privileged class. It was for the sake of <span class="accented">these</span> poor wandering sheep that he left his home of grandeur and peace. But there was a vein of sad irony running through these words of the Master. Between the lines we seem to read some such thoughts as these: "You know, O priests and Pharisees, <span class="accented">you</span> do not want me. You think you are safe already. But these poor despised ones, <span class="accented">they</span> want, they welcome me, like this Zacchaeus." This, too, was a lesson for all time. This scene probably took place the evening of the Lord's arrival at Zacchaeus's house at Jericho, after the evening meal, when the room arid court of the house were filled with guests and curious spectators. Dean Plumptre has an interesting suggestion that Zacchaeus the publican was one and the same with the publican of <a href="/luke/18-10.htm">Luke 18:10-14</a>, who in the temple "smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner! Is it too bold a conjecture that he who saw Nathanael under the fig tree (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>) had seen Zacchaeus in the temple, and that the figure in the parable of <a href="/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a> was in fact a portrait?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
