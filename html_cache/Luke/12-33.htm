In the cultural context of first-century Judea, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor, yet Jesus challenges this notion by emphasizing the spiritual value of giving. This echoes the teachings found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which states that giving to the poor is akin to lending to the Lord. The early church in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a> practiced communal living and shared their possessions, embodying this principle.<p><b>Provide yourselves with purses that will not wear out,</b><br>The imagery of purses that do not wear out symbolizes the eternal nature of spiritual treasures compared to the temporary nature of earthly wealth. In the ancient world, purses or money bags were essential for carrying currency, but they were subject to wear and decay. Jesus contrasts this with the enduring value of heavenly treasures, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where believers are encouraged to store up treasures in heaven.<p><b>an inexhaustible treasure in heaven,</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept of eternal rewards for those who prioritize God's kingdom over earthly riches. The idea of heavenly treasure is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, emphasizing the lasting value of spiritual investments. The Apostle Paul also speaks of an eternal inheritance in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, reinforcing the promise of a reward that is both secure and everlasting.<p><b>where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</b><br>This assurance of security contrasts with the vulnerability of earthly possessions, which can be stolen or ruined. In the historical context, theft and decay were common threats to material wealth. Jesus uses these examples to illustrate the imperishable nature of heavenly treasures. This echoes <a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16-17</a>, where the futility of hoarding wealth is highlighted, and <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>, which describes the incorruptible nature of the heavenly city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, offering teachings on the kingdom of God and the priorities of His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who seek to follow Christ's instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Those in need, whom Jesus instructs His followers to support through acts of charity and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Jesus calls us to focus on eternal treasures rather than temporary earthly possessions.

Sell what binds you, give to those in need, and secure a heavenly balance sheet that cannot fail. In God&#8217;s economy, generosity today becomes glory forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Sell that ye have.</span>--In its generalised form the precept is peculiar to St. Luke, but it has its parallel in the command given to the young ruler. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.">Matthew 19:21</a>.) It was clearly one of the precepts which his own characteristic tendencies led him to record (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and which found its fulfilment in the overflowing love that showed itself in the first days of the Church of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/2-45.htm" title="And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.">Acts 2:45</a>). Subsequent experience may have modified the duty of literal obedience, but the principle implied in it, that it is wise to sit loose to earthly possessions, possessing them as though we possessed not (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-30.htm" title="And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;">1Corinthians 7:30</a>), is one which has not lost its force.<p><span class= "bld">Provide yourselves bags . . .</span>--The Greek word for <span class= "ital">bags</span> (elsewhere "purse," <a href="/luke/22-35.htm" title="And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and money, and shoes, lacked you any thing? And they said, Nothing.">Luke 22:35</a>), may be noticed as peculiar to St. Luke. Of the three words used in the New Testament for "purse" or "bag" it was the most classical.<p><span class= "bld">Where no thief approacheth.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm" title="But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:">Matthew 6:20</a>. The form is in some respects briefer here, but "the treasure that faileth not" is a touch peculiar to St. Luke. The adjective which he uses is a rare one, and not found elsewhere in the New Testament; but one from the same root, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-14.htm" title="For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning.">Wisdom Of Solomon 7:14</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-18.htm" title="And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.">Wisdom Of Solomon 8:18</a>, describes wisdom as "a treasure that never faileth." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wan not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not</span>. "Those of you who <span class="accented">have</span> riches, see, this is what I counsel you to do with them." In considering these much-disputed words of the Master, we must remember <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">to whom</span> they were spoken: they were addressed to men and women who, if they would follow him, <span class="accented">must</span> set themselves free from all worldly possessions; they must literally forsake <span class="accented">all</span> to follow him. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We must bear in mind <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that the only community which attempted, as a community, to obey this charge <span class="accented">literally</span> was the Church of Jerusalem, and the result was that for long years this Church was plunged into the deepest poverty, so that assistance had to be sent even from far-distant Churches to this deeply impoverished Jerusalem community. [This we learn from Paul, the real compiler of this very Gospel, where the charge is reported.
