His reply indicates His authority and knowledge of Scripture, setting the stage for a teaching moment. Jesus often used questions to challenge the religious leaders and to provoke deeper thought, demonstrating His role as a teacher and a figure of wisdom.<p><b>Have you not read</b><br>This phrase suggests familiarity with the Scriptures, as Jesus addresses the Pharisees, who were well-versed in the Law and the Prophets. It implies that the answer to their question is found in the Scriptures they claim to know so well. This rhetorical question highlights the importance of understanding the spirit of the law, not just the letter.<p><b>what David did</b><br>Jesus references an event from the life of King David, a revered figure in Jewish history. By invoking David, Jesus draws a parallel between Himself and the beloved king, subtly asserting His own messianic identity. David's actions, recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>, provide a precedent for prioritizing human need over ritualistic observance.<p><b>when he and his companions were hungry</b><br>This context emphasizes the human need that justified David's actions. It underscores the principle that mercy and compassion should take precedence over strict legalism. The mention of hunger connects to the disciples' situation, illustrating that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit, not as a burden.

He appeals to David&#8217;s precedent to declare that human need can, under God&#8217;s own Word, override ceremonial restriction. The passage invites us to read the Bible carefully, value life above ritual, and recognize Jesus as the authoritative King who interprets Scripture perfectly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; how he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to</span> <span class="cmt_word">eat but for the priests alone?</span> Their own loved David, said the new Teacher to his jealous accusers, scrupled not, when he "was an hungred," to set at nought the twofold ordinance of sacrilege and of sabbath-breaking. (The reference is to <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>. David's visit to the sanctuary at Nob took place evidently on the sabbath, as the fresh supply of shewbread had been apparently just laid out; he must, too, have violated another rule by his journey on that day. See Stier, 'Words of the Lord Jesus,' on <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3, 4</a>.) The lesson which Jesus intended to draw from the example of the great hero-king and the high priest was that no ceremonial law was to override. the general principle of providing for the necessities of the body. St. Matthew adds here a very forcible saying of the Lord's spoken on this occasion, which goes to the root of the whole matter, "But if ye had known what <span class="accented">this</span> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless." These laws, as God originally gave them, were never intended to be a burden, rather they were meant to be a blessing for man. After ver. 5, Codex I) - a very ancient authority, written in the fifth century, now in the University Library at Cambridge, but one which contains many passages not found in any other trustworthy manuscript or version - adds the following strange narrative: "The same day, Jesus seeing a man who was working on the sabbath, saith to him, O man, if thou knowest what thou art doing, blessed art thou; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed, and a transgressor of the Law." As no other ancient authority of weight contains this remarkable addition to the recital of our Lord's teaching respecting the observance of the sabbath, it must be pronounced an interpolation. It belongs most likely to the very early days of the Christian story, and was probably founded on some tradition current in the primitive Church. The framework of the anecdote in its present form, too, shows a state of things simply impossible at this time. Any Jew who, in the days of Jesus Christ's earthly ministry, openly, like the man of the story, broke the sabbath in the daring way related, would have been liable to be arrested and condemned to death by stoning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Have you not read</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(anegn&#333;te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_314.htm">Strong's 314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To read, know again, know certainly, recognize, discern.
