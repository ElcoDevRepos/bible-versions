The Twelve refers to the twelve apostles, His closest followers, who were chosen to be witnesses of His ministry and resurrection. This moment highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, as well as the importance of preparing them for the events to come.<p><b>and said to them,</b><br>Jesus frequently used direct communication to convey important truths to His disciples. This phrase indicates a moment of teaching and revelation, where Jesus is about to share significant information. It underscores His role as a teacher and leader, guiding His followers with wisdom and foresight.<p><b>&#8220;Look, we are going up to Jerusalem,</b><br>Jerusalem is the central city of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. It holds significant historical and religious importance as the city of David and the place where many key events in Israel's history occurred. Jesus' journey to Jerusalem is pivotal, as it sets the stage for His crucifixion and resurrection. The phrase "going up" reflects the geographical ascent to Jerusalem, which is situated on a hill, and also signifies the spiritual significance of the journey.<p><b>and everything the prophets have written</b><br>This phrase connects Jesus' mission to the Old Testament prophecies, affirming the continuity of God's plan throughout Scripture. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel foretold the coming of the Messiah and His suffering. Jesus' reference to these writings underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the divine orchestration of salvation history.<p><b>about the Son of Man</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term that Jesus frequently used for Himself. It originates from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is depicted as a heavenly figure with authority and dominion. This title emphasizes both Jesus' humanity and His divine authority, highlighting His role as the prophesied Messiah who bridges heaven and earth.<p><b>will be fulfilled.</b><br>The fulfillment of prophecy is a central theme in the Gospels, demonstrating that Jesus' life and mission were in accordance with God's predetermined plan. This phrase assures the disciples that the events to come, including Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection, are not random but are the culmination of God's redemptive work as foretold by the prophets.

The insertion of the reference to the prophecies of the Passion is, on the other hand, peculiar to him, and is, perhaps, connected with the prominence given to those prophecies in <a href="/luke/24-27.htm" title="And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="/context/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44-45</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-42.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus again tells them of his Passion.

St. Mark (<a href="/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a>) prefaces this announcement with the words, "And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid." There was something unusual, evidently, in the manner and behaviour of the Master; silently, wrapped up in his own lofty meditations, he strode on in front of the company of his followers. A feeling of awe and fear stole over them as they watched the silent Master with the shadow of the coming cross falling, perhaps, across his countenance. Much had happened lately: the teaching growing more and more solemn as the end drew near; the raising of Lazarus; the intense enmity of the great men of the nation; the fixed determination to put the Master to death; his short retirement; then the announcement that he was going up to face his enemies at the great feast in Jerusalem; and now alone and silent he walked at their head. What was coming? thought the twelve and their friends.
