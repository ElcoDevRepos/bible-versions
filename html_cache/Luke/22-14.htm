In the context of the Passover, it refers to the time set for the meal, which was traditionally in the evening. This timing is significant as it aligns with the Jewish understanding of sacred times and events. The "hour" also foreshadows the impending suffering and crucifixion of Jesus, fulfilling the divine plan of salvation. This moment is a culmination of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the suffering servant.<p><b>Jesus reclined at the table</b><br>Reclining at the table was a customary posture during meals in ancient Near Eastern cultures, especially during significant feasts like Passover. This posture signifies a relaxed and intimate setting, appropriate for the gravity of the Last Supper. It also reflects the freedom and rest that Jesus offers through His sacrifice, contrasting with the bondage of sin. The act of reclining is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where a table is prepared in the presence of enemies, symbolizing God's provision and protection.<p><b>with His apostles</b><br>The apostles, chosen by Jesus, represent the foundation of the early Church. Their presence at this pivotal moment underscores their role as witnesses to Jesus' ministry and His resurrection.

The preparation had been made in the "large upper room," and the Lord and the twelve sat down, or rather reclined on the couches covered with carpets, the tables before them laid with the dishes peculiar to the solemn Passover Supper, each dish telling its part of the old loved story of the great deliverance. There was the lamb the Paschal victim, and the bitter herbs, the unleavened bread and the reddish sweet conserve of fruits - commemorating, it is said, by its color the hard labors of brickmaking, one of the chief burdens of the Egyptian bondage - into which the Blaster dipped the sop, and gave it to the traitor-apostle (<a href="/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). The Lord reclined, probably, at the middle table; St. John next to him; St. Peter most likely on the other side; and the others reclining in an order corresponding more or less closely with the threefold division of the twelve into groups of four.
