The centurion's regard for his servant indicates a compassionate relationship, which was not typical in Roman society where slaves were often seen as mere property. This reflects the centurion's character and foreshadows the compassion of Jesus, who values all individuals regardless of social status.<p><b>of a centurion</b><br>Centurions were Roman officers commanding about 100 soldiers. They were known for their discipline and leadership. The presence of a centurion in Capernaum highlights the Roman occupation of Judea. Centurions are often depicted positively in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius and in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a> with Julius. This centurion's faith and humility are significant, as he recognizes Jesus' authority, paralleling the authority he holds over his soldiers.<p><b>was sick and about to die</b><br>The severity of the servant's illness underscores the urgency of the situation. In the ancient world, medical knowledge was limited, and many illnesses were life-threatening. This sets the stage for a miraculous intervention, emphasizing Jesus' power over life and death. The phrase also highlights the centurion's desperation and faith, as he seeks help from Jesus, a Jewish teacher, despite being a Roman officer. This act of faith is reminiscent of other instances where Gentiles demonstrate great faith, such as the Syrophoenician woman in <a href="/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24-30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer commanding approximately 100 soldiers.

Had the physician been unable to satisfy himself from what he heard as to the nature of the disease? The details that follow show that he had made inquiries, and was able to supply some details which St. Matthew had not given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain centurion's servant</span>; literally, <span class="accented">slave.</span> The difference is important, as we shall see in the picture presented to us of the centurion's character. A centurion was an officer in the Roman army: the grade answers to the modern European captain - German, <span class="accented">hauptmann</span>; the command included a hundred soldiers. Scholars are not agreed respecting the special service of this particular officer. Some consider he was a Greek or Syrian holding a commission under the prince of the country, the tetrach Herod Antipas; others, that he was in the service of the empire, with a small detachment of the garrison of Caesarea, doing duty at the important lake-city, probably in connection with the revenue. It is clear that Roman garrisons at this period were dotted about the various centres of population in these semi-dependent states. At Jerusalem we know a considerable Roman force was stationed, professedly to keep order in the turbulent capital, but really, no doubt, to overawe the national party. <span class="cmt_word">Was sick, and ready to die</span>. St. Matthew calls the disease paralysis, and adds that the sufferer was in extreme pain. The disorder was probably some dangerous form of rheumatic fever, which not unfrequently attacks the region of the heart, and is accompanied with severe pain, and proves in many instances fatal. The ordinary, paralysis would scarcely be accompanied with the acute pain mentioned by St. Matthew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[There]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tinos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
