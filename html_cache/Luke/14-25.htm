The large crowds suggest that His teachings and miracles had attracted significant attention. In the context of first-century Judea, a region under Roman occupation, such gatherings could be seen as politically sensitive. The crowds likely included a mix of genuine followers, curious onlookers, and those seeking miracles. This mirrors the Old Testament gatherings of people around prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who also performed miracles and called for repentance.<p><b>and He turned and said to them</b><br>Jesus' act of turning to address the crowd signifies a deliberate moment of teaching. This is a common motif in the Gospels, where Jesus often uses the opportunity of a gathered audience to impart crucial lessons. The act of turning also suggests a shift from action to instruction, emphasizing the importance of His forthcoming words. This moment is reminiscent of the prophets who would often turn to address the people of Israel with messages from God, highlighting Jesus' role as a prophet and teacher.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the teacher and leader who is addressing the large crowds.

The people were drawn by His miracles and teaching, much like the multitudes in <a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2</a> who followed because &#8220;they saw the signs He was performing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such numbers can look impressive, yet Scripture warns that popularity does not equal genuine faith (see <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). Jesus never watered down truth to keep a crowd; instead, He made the cost of discipleship clear (<a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were traveling</b><p>&#8226; The verb hints at a continual, on-the-move procession. The Lord was heading toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), and these travelers were literally on the road with Him.<p>&#8226; Walking beside Christ physically is not the same as following Him spiritually. Earlier, would-be followers promised loyalty but balked when commitment became inconvenient (<a href="/luke/9-57.htm">Luke 9:57-62</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Jesus,</b><p>&#8226; Proximity to the Savior is a privilege (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>), yet it brings responsibility. To be &#8220;with Jesus&#8221; means embracing His mission, message, and lordship (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Many in the crowd wanted blessings without submission, echoing those in <a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23-25</a> whom Jesus did not entrust Himself to because He &#8220;knew what was in man.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He turned</b><p>&#8226; The Master literally pivoted, giving the multitude His full attention. He never lets surface enthusiasm go untested (<a href="/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His turning parallels other decisive moments when He faced people to expose motives (<a href="/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44</a>; <a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>). The gesture signals a gracious but firm confrontation: Will they move from curiosity to commitment?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to them</b><p>&#8226; What follows in verses 26-33 is a sobering call: loving Him above family, bearing one&#8217;s own cross, counting the cost. The tone is corrective; Jesus refines the crowd into true disciples (cf. <a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60-66</a>).<p>&#8226; By speaking publicly, He ensures no one can claim ignorance. Everyone hears the same uncompromising standard (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37-39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/14-25.htm">Luke 14:25</a> shows Jesus pausing His journey to sift a large, fascinated crowd. Physical nearness and enthusiastic numbers do not satisfy Him; authentic discipleship does. He turns, looks, and speaks so each listener must decide: Will I merely walk near Jesus, or will I follow Him&#8212;whatever the cost?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-35.</span> - The <span class="accented">qualifications of his real disciples.

These great multitudes were made up now of enemies as well as friends. Curiosity doubtless attracted many; the fame of the Teacher had gone through the length and breadth of the land. The end, the Master well knew, was very near, and, in the full view of his own self-sacrifice, the higher and the more ideal were the claims he made upon those who professed to be his followers. He was anxious now, at the end, clearly to make it known to all these multitudes what <span class="accented">serving him</span> really signified - entire self-renunciation; a real, not a poetic or sentimental, taking up the cross (ver. 27). Even his own chosen disciples were yet a long way from apprehending the terrible meaning of this cross he spoke of, and which to him now bore so ghastly a significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Large</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">crowds</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8004;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ochloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3793.htm">Strong's 3793: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of echo; a throng; by implication, the rabble; by extension, a class of people; figuratively, a riot.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were now traveling with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Syneporeuonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4848.htm">Strong's 4848: </a> </span><span class="str2">From sun and poreuomai; to journey together; by implication, to assemble.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
