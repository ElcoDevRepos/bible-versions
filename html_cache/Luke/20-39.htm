They played a significant role in religious and legal matters. In the context of <a href="/luke/20.htm">Luke 20</a>, they were part of the group questioning Jesus, trying to trap Him in His words. Their response here indicates a moment of agreement, which is notable given their usual opposition to Jesus. This reflects the impact of Jesus' wisdom and authority, even on those who were typically His adversaries.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher,</b><br>The term "Teacher" (Greek: Didaskalos) was a respectful title used for someone recognized as a master or authority in religious teaching. Despite their frequent challenges to Jesus, the scribes acknowledge His role as a teacher, which underscores His recognized authority and the respect He commanded, even among those who opposed Him.<p><b>You have spoken well!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates approval of Jesus' response to the Sadducees, who had questioned Him about the resurrection. The scribes, who believed in the resurrection, found Jesus' answer compelling and aligned with their own beliefs. This moment highlights Jesus' ability to navigate complex theological debates and His skill in addressing and resolving contentious issues. It also demonstrates His fulfillment of wisdom prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, where the Messiah is described as having the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>These were Jewish scholars and teachers of the Law.
