In the Jewish context, this often referred to the Pharisees, who were known for their strict observance of the law and traditions. The concept of self-righteousness is contrasted with the biblical teaching that righteousness comes from God (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>). This self-reliance on personal righteousness is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, highlighting the need for humility and recognition of one's own sinfulness (<a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>).<p><b>and viewed others with contempt</b><br>The attitude of contempt towards others is a reflection of pride and a lack of love, which is contrary to the greatest commandments to love God and love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). This disdain for others often manifested in the Pharisees' interactions with those they deemed sinners or unclean, such as tax collectors and Gentiles. The cultural context of first-century Judaism placed a high value on ritual purity and social status, which often led to exclusion and judgment of those who did not conform.<p><b>He also told this parable:</b><br>Jesus frequently used parables as a teaching tool to convey spiritual truths through simple stories. Parables were a common method of instruction in Jewish culture, allowing listeners to engage with the narrative and uncover deeper meanings. This particular parable, like many others, is designed to challenge the listener's understanding and provoke self-reflection. The use of parables also fulfilled prophecy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of teaching in parables. Jesus' parables often revealed the nature of God's kingdom and the attitudes required to enter it, emphasizing themes of humility, repentance, and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is the one who tells the parable. His teachings often challenge the self-righteous and call for humility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the Pharisees are often the target of Jesus' parables about self-righteousness. They were a religious group known for strict adherence to the law and often viewed themselves as morally superior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>The verse specifically mentions "some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt." This group is the primary audience for the parable, representing those who are self-righteous.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable.htm">The Parable</a></b><br>While the specific parable is not detailed in this verse, it sets the stage for the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector, which follows in the subsequent verses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this verse, the setting for the parable that follows is the temple, a significant place of worship and sacrifice in Jewish life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/self-righteousness_vs._true_righteousness.htm">Self-Righteousness vs. True Righteousness</a></b><br>Self-righteousness is based on one's own perceived moral superiority, while true righteousness comes from God through faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_contempt.htm">The Danger of Contempt</a></b><br>Viewing others with contempt is a sign of pride and self-righteousness, which can lead to spiritual blindness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>True humility recognizes one's own sinfulness and need for God's mercy, as exemplified by the tax collector in the parable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_worship.htm">The Heart of Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be an act of humility and repentance, not a display of self-righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_grace_to_the_humble.htm">God's Grace to the Humble</a></b><br>God honors those who approach Him with a humble heart, acknowledging their need for His grace.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_18_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_9_Self-righteousness_vs_humility.htm">How does Luke 18:9 challenge our view of self-righteousness and humility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_9_Dangers_of_self-righteousness.htm">What does Luke 18:9 teach about the dangers of trusting in our righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_a_Pharisee-like_mindset.htm">How can we avoid the Pharisee's attitude described in Luke 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_self-righteousness.htm">What other scriptures warn against self-righteousness like in Luke 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Cultivating_humility_in_prayer.htm">How can we cultivate humility in prayer as taught in Luke 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_9_on_self-righteousness_humility.htm">What does Luke 18:9 teach about self-righteousness and humility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_9_s_take_on_moral_superiority.htm">How does Luke 18:9 challenge our view of moral superiority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Luke_18_9_parable.htm">What historical context influenced the parable in Luke 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_for_luke_18_9-14.htm">Is there historical or archeological support to confirm or question the parable of the Pharisee and tax collector in Luke 18:9&#8211;14?

It is, perhaps, open for us to think that isolated fragments of our Lord's teaching, treasured up here and there in the memory of disciples, and written down in answer to St. Luke's inquiries in the second stage of the growth of the Gospel records, would be likely to have such an introduction.<p>The "certain which trusted" are not specified as being actually Pharisees, and included, we may believe, disciples in whom the Pharisee temper was gaining the mastery, and who needed to be taught as by a <span class= "ital">reductio ad absurdum,</span> what it naturally led to.<p><span class= "bld">Despised others.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the rest</span>--<span class= "ital">viz.,</span> all others.

It never uttered itself, perhaps, in a more repulsive form than when the Pharisees came to speak of the great mass of their brother-Israelites as the brute people, the "people of the earth."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake this parable</span>. With this parable, "the Pharisee and the publican," St. Luke concludes his memories of the last journeyings toward Jerusalem. The incidents which directly follow took place close to Jerusalem; and here St. Luke's narrative rejoins that of SS. Matthew and Mark. No note of time or place assists us in defining exactly the period when the Master spoke this teaching; some time, however, in these last journeyings, that is, in the closing months of the public ministry, the parable in question was certainly spoken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
