In the cultural context of first-century Judea, lending was a common practice, but it was often limited to those within one's social or economic circle. The Mosaic Law, particularly in passages like <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>, discouraged charging interest to fellow Israelites, promoting a spirit of generosity and community support. This teaching challenges the listener to go beyond the norm of reciprocal relationships and to embrace a selfless love that mirrors God's grace.<p><b>what credit is that to you?</b><br>Here, the term "credit" refers to the moral or spiritual benefit one might gain. The rhetorical question implies that there is no spiritual merit in actions that are purely transactional. This echoes the broader biblical theme that true righteousness and reward come from actions motivated by love and selflessness, not by the expectation of return or recognition. This teaching aligns with the broader message of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of internal righteousness over external acts (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>).<p><b>Even sinners lend to sinners</b><br>The term "sinners" in this context refers to those outside the covenant community or those who do not live according to God's laws. By stating that even sinners lend to each other, Jesus highlights that such behavior is common and expected even among those who do not follow God's ways. This comparison serves to challenge His followers to a higher standard of love and generosity that surpasses the ordinary practices of the world.<p><b>expecting to be repaid in full</b><br>This phrase underscores the natural human inclination towards self-interest and reciprocity. In the ancient world, as today, lending with the expectation of full repayment was a standard practice. Jesus calls His followers to a radical form of generosity that does not seek personal gain. This teaching is consistent with the broader biblical narrative that encourages believers to trust in God's provision and to reflect His character by giving freely, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon that includes teachings on love, mercy, and generosity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, including the Twelve Apostles and a larger group of followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinners.htm">Sinners</a></b><br>A term used to describe those who do not follow God's laws, often used by Jesus to contrast the behavior expected of His followers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is delivered, a series of teachings by Jesus found in <a href="/bsb/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lending_practices.htm">Lending Practices</a></b><br>The cultural and economic context of lending and borrowing in first-century Judea, where lending was often transactional and interest-based.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_beyond_reciprocity.htm">Generosity Beyond Reciprocity</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to a higher standard of generosity that does not seek repayment or reward.

Here He drills down on motive:<p>&#8226; Lending can look generous, yet still revolve around self-interest when repayment is assumed.<p>&#8226; The Law had always encouraged open-handed giving to the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-10</a>), and Psalms celebrates the man who &#8220;is ever generous and lends freely&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>). Now the Lord exposes the heart behind the act.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/5-42.htm">Matthew 5:42</a> echoes this: &#8220;Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.&#8221; The stress is on meeting a need, not securing a return.<p>&#8226; By releasing control over the outcome, the believer mirrors the Father, &#8220;who causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what credit is that to you?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Credit&#8221; points to heavenly commendation. If the transaction benefits the giver here and now, there is no distinct testimony of grace. <a href="/matthew/5-46.htm">Matthew 5:46</a> uses the same reasoning about loving only those who love back: &#8220;what reward will you get?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/14-12.htm">Luke 14:12-14</a> expands the principle: invite those who cannot repay, &#8220;and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20</a> shows the same wordplay: enduring hardship unjustly &#8220;finds favor with God.&#8221; The Lord notices acts that carry no earthly payoff.<p>&#8226; Living this way shifts the believer&#8217;s focus from visible returns to the unseen reward God promises (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.</b><p>&#8226; Jesus draws a sharp contrast: pagan society operates on reciprocity; kingdom living operates on grace.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sinners&#8221; here refers to people outside covenant obedience. They lend, yet the transaction stays strictly business&#8212;principal plus full repayment.<p>&#8226; Believers are called higher: &#8220;love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Such unchecked generosity reflects God&#8217;s own giving nature (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) and becomes a witness that we are &#8220;sons of the Most High&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> encourages the same posture: &#8220;Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD, and He will repay the lender.&#8221; The real payback comes from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34</a> presses past the surface act of lending and targets the heart posture. Lending that banks on repayment is ordinary; anyone can do it. Kingdom-minded lending releases the right to collect, trusting God to handle any reward.
