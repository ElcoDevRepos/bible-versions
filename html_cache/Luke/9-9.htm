This act is recorded in the Gospels as a result of John's condemnation of Herod's unlawful marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife. Herod's acknowledgment of beheading John reflects his awareness of his own guilt and the gravity of his actions. Historically, Herod Antipas was known for his political maneuvering and moral weaknesses, which are evident in his interactions with John and later with Jesus.<p><b>"but who is this man I hear such things about?"</b><br>Herod's question reveals his curiosity and confusion about Jesus' identity. Despite his political power, Herod is perplexed by the reports of Jesus' miraculous works and teachings. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' true identity is often misunderstood or questioned by those in authority. The question also highlights the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry, as even rulers are hearing of His deeds. This echoes earlier scriptural prophecies about the Messiah being a figure of great renown and influence.<p><b>And he kept trying to see Jesus.</b><br>Herod's persistent desire to see Jesus indicates a mix of intrigue and perhaps fear. While he is curious, there is also an underlying tension, as Herod might be concerned about Jesus' growing influence and the potential threat to his own authority. This desire to see Jesus is not driven by faith or repentance but rather by a fascination with the miraculous and the unknown. Herod's eventual encounter with Jesus during the Passion narrative further illustrates his inability to comprehend Jesus' true nature and mission, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah about the Messiah being misunderstood and rejected by those in power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, son of Herod the Great.

Here, in SS. Matthew and Mark, follows the dramatic and vivid account of the death of John the Baptist. St. Luke probably omits it, as his Gospel, or rather Paul's, was derived from what they heard from eyewitnesses and hearers of the Lord. As regards SS. Matthew and Mark, the latter of whom was probably simply the amanuensis of St. Peter, the awful event was woven into their life's story. It was most natural that, in their public preaching and teaching, they should make constant mention of the tragedy which so personally affected Jesus and his little company. St. Luke and his master, Paul, on the other hand, who were not <span class="accented">personally</span> present with the Lord when these events took place, would be likely to confine their memoirs as closely as possible to those circumstances in which Jesus alone occupied the prominent place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
