The Jewish Sabbath ends at sunset, which means that people were now free to travel and carry burdens without breaking Sabbath laws. This context highlights the eagerness of the people to seek Jesus' healing as soon as it was permissible. The setting sun also symbolizes the end of an era of waiting and the beginning of a new day of hope and healing through Christ.<p><b>all who were ill with various diseases</b><br>This phrase underscores the widespread nature of sickness and suffering in the world, reflecting the fallen state of humanity. The mention of "various diseases" indicates that Jesus' healing power was not limited to specific ailments but was comprehensive. This diversity of illnesses also points to the universal need for a Savior who can address all forms of human brokenness.<p><b>were brought to Jesus</b><br>The act of bringing the sick to Jesus demonstrates the faith and hope of the people in His ability to heal. It also reflects the communal nature of faith, where friends and family play a role in bringing others to Christ. This mirrors the actions of the friends of the paralytic in <a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3-5</a>, showing the importance of intercession and support in the community of believers.<p><b>and laying His hands on each one</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant gesture in biblical tradition, often associated with blessing, healing, and the impartation of the Holy Spirit. Jesus' personal touch signifies His compassion and willingness to engage intimately with those who are suffering. This act also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our infirmities.<p><b>He healed them</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' divine authority and power over sickness, affirming His identity as the Son of God. The healing acts serve as a foretaste of the ultimate healing and restoration that will come through His death and resurrection. It also fulfills the messianic prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which Jesus Himself reads in the synagogue earlier in <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>, declaring His mission to bring healing and liberation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion by healing the sick.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sick.htm">The Sick</a></b><br>Individuals suffering from various diseases, representing the brokenness and need for healing in humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where these events took place, serving as a significant location for Jesus' early ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sunset.htm">Sunset</a></b><br>The time of day when the people brought the sick to Jesus, indicating the end of the Sabbath and the beginning of a new opportunity for healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who brought the sick to Jesus, showing faith and hope in His healing power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_of_christ.htm">Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to heal each person individually demonstrates His deep compassion and personal care for our needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_action.htm">Faith and Action</a></b><br>The people showed faith by bringing the sick to Jesus, reminding us to actively seek Him in times of need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/power_of_touch.htm">Power of Touch</a></b><br>Jesus laid hands on the sick, illustrating the power of personal touch and presence in ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/healing_and_wholeness.htm">Healing and Wholeness</a></b><br>Jesus' healing ministry points to His ultimate mission to restore wholeness to humanity, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/timing_and_opportunity.htm">Timing and Opportunity</a></b><br>The healing at sunset signifies that God's timing is perfect, and opportunities for His work often come when we least expect them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_4_40_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 4:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_4_40_Jesus_power_over_illness.htm">How does Luke 4:40 demonstrate Jesus' authority over sickness and demons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_Jesus_compassion_in_Luke_4_40.htm">What can we learn about Jesus' compassion from Luke 4:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Luke_4_40_s_link_to_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">How does Luke 4:40 connect to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_mirror_Jesus_healing_today_2.htm">In what ways can we emulate Jesus' healing ministry today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_4_40_How_does_it_inspire_faith.htm">How can Luke 4:40 inspire our faith in Jesus' power to heal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_4_40_Jesus_power_over_illness_2.htm">How does Luke 4:40 demonstrate Jesus' authority over illness and demons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Luke_4_40_healings.htm">What historical evidence supports the healing events in Luke 4:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_heal_at_sunset_in_Luke_4_40.htm">Why did Jesus heal people at sunset in Luke 4:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_stance_on_alternative_medicine.htm">What is the Bible's view on alternative medicine?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_mark_1_34_healings_verified_elsewhere.htm">Can the numerous healings and exorcisms in Mark 1:34 be corroborated by independent historical or medical sources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_laying_hands.htm">What does the Bible say about laying on hands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_tourette's.htm">What does the Bible say about Tourette syndrome?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 4:40 Mean</div><b>At sunset</b><p>- Luke notes the timing because sundown signaled the close of the Sabbath (cf. <a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32</a>).

The healing of the "possessed" in the synagogue that morning, followed by the cure of the fever of Simon's wife's mother, we know was rapidly noised abroad, and in great measure accoutered for the crowds who brought their sick to him in the evening. It was evidently in the life of Jesus a notable occasion, and many a sick tortured one had occasion to bless the Master's presence then. It was so memorable an occasion that all the three evangelists notice it; their reports are recorded in almost the same words. No doubt, in the early days of the preaching of the faith, this evening's work was constantly alluded to by the first teachers. The note of time, "when the sun was setting," indicates that the moment in question had been waited for, for sunset ended the sabbath, and then those outside Capernaum and in its outlying suburbs were enabled to bring their sick and afflicted without infringing the strict sabbath rules. "The twilight scene, of Jesus moving about with word and touch of healing among the sick and suffering, the raving and tortured crowd (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>), is one of the most striking in the Gospels, and St. Matthew quotes it as a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>" (Farrar). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At sunset,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Dynontos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1416.htm">Strong's 1416: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sink, set (as the sun).
