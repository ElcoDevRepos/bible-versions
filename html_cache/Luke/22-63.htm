These men were likely Jewish temple guards rather than Roman soldiers, as Jesus was first taken to the high priest's house. The arrest and custody of Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would be "oppressed and afflicted." The act of being held by these men signifies the beginning of Jesus' physical suffering and the fulfillment of His role as the sacrificial Lamb.<p><b>began to mock Him</b><br>Mocking was a common form of humiliation and was used to demean and belittle those who were considered powerless or defeated. In the cultural context of the time, mocking was a way to assert dominance and control. This act of mockery fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, where it is foretold that the Messiah would be scorned and mocked. The mockery also highlights the spiritual blindness of those who did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, despite His teachings and miracles.<p><b>and beat Him.</b><br>The physical beating of Jesus was a precursor to the more severe suffering He would endure during His crucifixion. This act of violence fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the suffering servant is described as giving His back to those who strike Him. The beating is a type of the sacrificial system, where the innocent lamb is slaughtered for the sins of the people. Jesus' willingness to endure such suffering demonstrates His obedience to the Father's will and His love for humanity, as He takes upon Himself the punishment for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being held and mistreated by the guards.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_holding_jesus.htm">The Men Holding Jesus</a></b><br>These are likely the temple guards or Roman soldiers who have taken Jesus into custody following His arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mocking_and_beating.htm">Mocking and Beating</a></b><br>This event marks the beginning of the physical and emotional abuse Jesus endures leading up to His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_suffering_for_righteousness.htm">The Reality of Suffering for Righteousness</a></b><br>Jesus' mistreatment reminds us that suffering can be a part of the Christian journey.

There both Annas and Caiaphas apparently lodged. In the first instance, Jesus was brought before Annas, who was evidently the leading personage of the Sanhedrin of that day. Details of the preliminary examination are given apparently by <a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13, 19-24</a>. In this first and informal trial Caiaphas was evidently present, and took part (ver. 19). At the close of this unofficial but important proceeding, Annas sent him to Caiaphas. The true reading in <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a> is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, "Annas therefore sent him." That is, at the close of the first <span class="accented">unofficial</span> examination, which took place in Annas's apartments in the palace of the high priest, Annas sent him to be examined <span class="accented">officially</span> before Caiaphas, the reigning high priest, and a committee of the Sanhedrim This, the second trial of Jesus, is related at some length by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-66</a>) and St. Mark (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55 64</a>). The priests on that occasion sought false witnesses, but their witness did not, we know, agree. Jesus kept silence until Caiaphas arose, and with awful solemnity adjured him to say whether he was the Christ, the Son of God. So adjured, Jesus answered definitely in the affirmative. Then Caiaphas rent his robe, and appealed to the assembly, who answered the appeal by a unanimous cry," He is guilty of death." After this hearing before Caiapnas and a committee of the Sanhedrin, the condemned One was conducted before the full assembly of the Sanhedrim While being led across the court, he heard Peter's third denial. It was during the interval which elapsed before the great council assembled, that the mocking related in these verses (63-65) took place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-63.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
