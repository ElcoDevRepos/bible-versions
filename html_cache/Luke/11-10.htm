In the biblical context, asking is an act of faith and dependence on God. The concept of asking and receiving is rooted in the Jewish tradition of prayer, where God is seen as a loving Father who provides for His children. This promise is not limited to a select few but is available to "everyone," highlighting God's impartiality and generosity. The idea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a> and <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourage believers to approach God with confidence.<p><b>he who seeks finds;</b><br>Seeking implies a deeper level of engagement and desire for understanding or relationship. In the historical context, seeking was often associated with the pursuit of wisdom and truth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17</a>, where wisdom is personified and promises to be found by those who seek her. This phrase suggests an active pursuit of God's will and presence, aligning with the biblical theme that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). It also reflects the cultural practice of seeking guidance from God through prayer and meditation on the Scriptures.<p><b>and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</b><br>Knocking represents persistence and perseverance in prayer. In the cultural context of the time, doors were often closed for protection, and knocking was necessary to gain entry. This imagery suggests that God is accessible and willing to open the door to those who persistently seek Him. The open door symbolizes opportunities, blessings, and the revelation of God's will. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, inviting believers to fellowship with Him. The act of knocking and the promise of an open door illustrate the relational aspect of faith, where God responds to the earnest and persistent prayers of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples about prayer and the nature of God's response to those who earnestly seek Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are learning about prayer and faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This teaching occurs during Jesus' ministry, as He instructs His followers on how to pray and trust in God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_response.htm">The Assurance of God's Response</a></b><br>Jesus assures us that God is attentive to our prayers.

The promise is universal&#8212;&#8220;everyone,&#8221; not a select few (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;receives&#8221; assures that God actively gives, echoing His generous nature (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The context (<a href="/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-13</a>) contrasts a reluctant neighbor with a willing Father; if persistence moves a friend, how much more will a loving God answer His children (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse presupposes requests aligned with God&#8217;s will. In Scripture, answered prayer partners with obedience and faith (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he who seeks finds</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;he who seeks finds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Seeking implies earnest pursuit, not a casual glance.

The greatest &#8220;find&#8221; is God Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Examples abound: those who sought Jesus&#8212;like Bartimaeus (<a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46-52</a>) or the Syrophoenician woman (<a href="/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24-30</a>)&#8212;encountered His compassion.<p>&#8226; Seeking also involves searching Scripture (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>) and walking in righteousness (<a href="/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a>). God opens understanding to those who earnestly pursue truth (<a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to him who knocks, the door will be opened</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Knocking pictures persistence.

Through Him we receive salvation and fellowship (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; When the door opens, it often brings responsibility: opportunities for service, witness, and growth (<a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-10.htm">Luke 11:10</a> assures believers that God responds generously to persistent, trust-filled prayer. Asking, seeking, and knocking describe escalating expressions of faith: requesting, pursuing, and persevering. Because God is a loving Father, each step meets His open-handed willingness to give, reveal, and grant access. The verse encourages confident, continual communion with Him, certain that He hears, answers, and invites us ever deeper into His grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
