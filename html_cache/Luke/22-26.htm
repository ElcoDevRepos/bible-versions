In the context of <a href="/luke/22.htm">Luke 22</a>, Jesus contrasts His disciples with the Gentile rulers who exercise authority over others. The disciples are called to a higher standard, reflecting the values of the Kingdom of God rather than the world. This echoes the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God commands His people to be holy as He is holy. The early church faced similar challenges, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are described as a "chosen people" set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest,</b><br>In the cultural context of the first century, the youngest in a family or group often held the least power and status. Jesus subverts societal norms by teaching that true greatness in His Kingdom is marked by humility and a willingness to take the lowest place. This teaching is consistent with Jesus' own example, as He came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The concept of the "greatest" being the "youngest" also aligns with the prophetic imagery of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who humbles Himself for the sake of others.<p><b>and the one who leads like the one who serves.</b><br>Leadership in the Kingdom of God is characterized by servanthood, contrasting sharply with the authoritarian models prevalent in the Roman Empire and other ancient cultures. Jesus Himself exemplified this principle, notably in <a href="/john/13.htm">John 13</a>, where He washes the disciples' feet, a task typically reserved for the lowest servant. This act foreshadows His ultimate service through His sacrificial death on the cross. The call to servant leadership is further reinforced in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>, where believers are encouraged to have the same mindset as Christ, who took on the nature of a servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing instruction to His disciples on leadership and servanthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing future leaders of the early Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, where Jesus and His disciples gathered for the Last Supper.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The event during which Jesus imparts this teaching, a significant moment before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_worldly_leaders.htm">The Worldly Leaders</a></b><br>Implied contrast to the disciples, representing those who exercise authority in a domineering manner.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/servant_leadership.htm">Servant Leadership</a></b><br>True greatness in the Kingdom of God is measured by one's willingness to serve others, not by exercising authority over them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility.htm">Humility</a></b><br>Embrace humility by considering others more significant than yourself, following the example of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/counter-cultural_values.htm">Counter-Cultural Values</a></b><br>The values of the Kingdom often stand in stark contrast to worldly values, calling believers to a different standard.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/imitating_christ.htm">Imitating Christ</a></b><br>As followers of Jesus, we are called to imitate His example of servanthood and selflessness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_service.htm">Practical Service</a></b><br>Look for opportunities in daily life to serve others, reflecting the love and humility of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_22_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 22:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Be_the_greatest_by_serving_others_today_2.htm">How can we embody "the greatest among you" as a servant today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_26_on_Christian_leadership.htm">What does Luke 22:26 teach about leadership in a Christian context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_22_26_John_13_foot_washing.htm">How does Luke 22:26 connect with Jesus washing the disciples' feet in John 13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_humility_daily_2.htm">In what ways can we prioritize humility in our daily interactions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_26_vs_societal_power_norms.htm">How does Luke 22:26 challenge societal views on power and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_26_s_impact_on_leadership_norms.htm">How does Luke 22:26 challenge traditional views of leadership and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Luke_22_26_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Luke 22:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_26_and_Gospel_servanthood.htm">How does Luke 22:26 align with the overall theme of servanthood in the Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_dominion_theology.htm">What defines Dominion Theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/key_events_in_jesus'_trials.htm">What were the key events in Jesus' trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_is_the_greatest_in_the_kingdom.htm">Who is the greatest in the kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_were_israel's_seventy_elders.htm">Who were Israel's seventy elders?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 22:26 Mean</div><b>But you shall not be like them</b><p>&#8226; Jesus has just reminded the disciples, &#8220;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-25.htm">Luke 22:25</a>). Rulers in the world flex power, demand privilege, and expect applause.<p>&#8226; &#8220;But,&#8221; He says, &#8220;you shall not be like them.&#8221; The contrast is absolute. Followers of Christ must reject any leadership style rooted in ego or coercion (cf. <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> adds, &#8220;Do not be conformed to this world,&#8221; reinforcing that the church&#8217;s culture is to be radically different from the world&#8217;s pecking order.<p>&#8226; Practical picture:<p>&#8211; No entitlement mentality.<p>&#8211; No scramble for titles or VIP treatment.<p>&#8211; No tolerating pride in ourselves or praising it in others.<p>&#8226; When believers refuse worldly power games, they show that the kingdom of God operates on a wholly different value system.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the greatest among you should be like the youngest</b><p>&#8226; In that culture the youngest had the least status and fewest rights.

The kingdom prizes child-like lowliness.<p>&#8226; Paul echoes the theme: &#8220;Brothers, think of what you were when you were called&#8230; God chose the lowly things of the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; What this looks like:<p>&#8211; Listening instead of commanding.<p>&#8211; Taking the last seat at the table (<a href="/luke/14-10.htm">Luke 14:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Making room for voices that normally go unheard (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus isn&#8217;t suppressing ambition; He&#8217;s redefining it: aim to be great at humility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the one who leads like the one who serves</b><p>&#8226; Jesus models the line minutes later: &#8220;I am among you as one who serves&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>).
