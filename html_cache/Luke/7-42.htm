The inability to repay signifies a state of helplessness and dependency on the mercy of the creditor. In the broader biblical context, debt is frequently used as a metaphor for sin (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>). The parable reflects the human condition of being unable to repay the debt of sin to God, emphasizing the need for divine grace.<p><b>he forgave both of them</b><br>Forgiveness in this context is an act of grace, unmerited and freely given. The creditor's decision to forgive the debts of both individuals illustrates God's willingness to forgive sins regardless of their magnitude. This act of forgiveness is a central theme in the New Testament, reflecting the teachings of Jesus on grace and mercy (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The act of forgiving debts also aligns with the Year of Jubilee in Levitical law, where debts were forgiven, and slaves were freed (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<p><b>Which one, then, will love him more?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question invites reflection on the relationship between forgiveness and love. The expected answer is that the one forgiven more will love more, illustrating the principle that awareness of the depth of one's forgiveness leads to greater love and gratitude. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as the story of the sinful woman who anoints Jesus' feet (<a href="/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>). The question challenges the listener to consider their own response to God's forgiveness and to cultivate a heart of gratitude and love in response to His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who uses parables to teach spiritual truths.
