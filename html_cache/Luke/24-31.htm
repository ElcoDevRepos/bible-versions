In biblical context, the opening of eyes often symbolizes spiritual enlightenment or understanding granted by God. This echoes <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, where Adam and Eve's eyes were opened to their sin. Here, however, it is a positive revelation, akin to the spiritual insight given to the disciples in <a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>, where Jesus opens their minds to understand the Scriptures. This moment is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>and they recognized Jesus</b><br>Recognition of Jesus is a central theme in the Gospels, often linked to faith and revelation. The disciples' inability to recognize Jesus earlier in the narrative (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>) highlights the supernatural aspect of this recognition. It parallels the experience of Mary Magdalene in <a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14-16</a>, where she recognizes Jesus only when He calls her by name. This recognition is not merely physical but spiritual, acknowledging Jesus as the risen Lord, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would be exalted.<p><b>and He disappeared from their sight</b><br>The sudden disappearance of Jesus underscores His resurrected, glorified state, which transcends physical limitations. This event is reminiscent of other post-resurrection appearances where Jesus appears and vanishes (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>). It emphasizes the mystery and majesty of the resurrection body, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>. Theologically, it signifies that Jesus' presence is no longer confined to physical sight but is now accessible through faith and the Holy Spirit, aligning with His promise in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> to be with His followers always.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, revealing Himself to them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_on_the_road_to_emmaus.htm">Disciples on the Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus who were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus, discussing the recent events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village approximately seven miles from Jerusalem, where the encounter between Jesus and the disciples takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breaking_of_bread.htm">The Breaking of Bread</a></b><br>The moment during the meal when Jesus breaks bread, leading to the disciples' recognition of Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disappearance_of_jesus.htm">The Disappearance of Jesus</a></b><br>After the disciples recognize Jesus, He vanishes from their sight, emphasizing the spiritual nature of His resurrected body.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_recognition.htm">Spiritual Recognition</a></b><br>Just as the disciples' eyes were opened to recognize Jesus, we must seek spiritual discernment to recognize God's presence in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture.htm">The Role of Scripture</a></b><br>Jesus explained the Scriptures to the disciples before they recognized Him.

In the order of time this is the first example of the new conditions of our Lord's risen life. It was not that He rose and left the room in which they sat. In a moment they knew Him with all the fulness of recognition; and then they saw Him no more. The work for which He had come to them was done. He had imparted comfort and insight, and had brought them into communion with Himself, and then they were to be taught that that communion was no longer to depend, as before, on a visible and localised presence.

Certain facts have, however, been revealed to us: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Resurrection was a reality, not an appearance; for on more than one occasion the Lord permitted the test of touch. He also ate before his disciples of their ordinary food. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet there was a manifest exemption flora the common conditions of bodily (corporeal) existence; for he comes through a closed door; he could <span class="accented">withdraw himself</span> when he would from touch as well as from sight; he could vanish in a moment from those looking on him; he could, as men gazed on him, rise by the exertion of his own will into the clouds of heaven. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He was known just as he pleased and when he pleased; for at times during the "forty days" men and women looked on him without a gleam of recognition, at times they gazed at him, knowing well that it was the Lord. On the words, "he vanished out of their sight," Godet writes, "It must be remembered that Jesus, strictly speaking, <span class="accented">was</span> already no <span class="accented">more with them</span> (ver. 44), and that the miracle consisted rather in his appearing than in his disappearing." Dr. Westcott expresses the same truth in different language, "What was natural to him before was now miraculous, what was before miraculous is now natural." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
