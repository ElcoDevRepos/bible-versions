This reply emphasizes His teaching method, often using direct and thought-provoking statements to convey deeper spiritual truths. Jesus frequently used such moments to teach about the Kingdom of God, shifting focus from earthly relationships to spiritual ones.<p><b>&#8220;My mother and brothers</b><br>Here, Jesus redefines familial relationships in spiritual terms. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, family ties were paramount, and loyalty to one's family was a significant social expectation. By referring to His followers as His family, Jesus elevates the spiritual bond above biological connections, emphasizing the importance of spiritual kinship in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>are those who hear the word of God</b><br>Hearing the word of God implies more than just listening; it involves understanding and accepting the message of the Gospel. This phrase connects to the parable of the sower earlier in <a href="/luke/8.htm">Luke 8</a>, where Jesus explains the different responses to the word of God. The emphasis is on being receptive and open to God's message, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>and carry it out.&#8221;</b><br>Carrying out the word of God involves obedience and action, reflecting a life transformed by faith. This concept is echoed in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers. Jesus highlights that true discipleship is demonstrated through living out God's commands, aligning with His teachings on bearing fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>).
