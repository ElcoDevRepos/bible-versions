This response highlights Jesus' authority and wisdom. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often uses questions and answers to reveal deeper truths, demonstrating His role as a teacher and prophet. His response here is direct and challenges the self-righteous attitudes of the religious leaders.<p><b>It is not the healthy who need a doctor</b><br>This phrase uses a metaphor to illustrate a spiritual truth. In the cultural context of the time, doctors were sought by those who were physically ill, not by those who were well. Jesus uses this analogy to emphasize that those who perceive themselves as spiritually "healthy" or righteous, like the Pharisees, do not recognize their need for spiritual healing. This reflects the broader biblical theme that self-righteousness blinds individuals to their need for God's grace.<p><b>but the sick</b><br>Here, "the sick" represents those who are aware of their sinfulness and need for repentance. In the historical context, tax collectors and sinners were marginalized and looked down upon by society, yet they were often more open to Jesus' message of salvation. This phrase underscores Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>. It also foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Gospel, which is available to all who recognize their need for redemption, regardless of their past.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees and scribes who are questioning His association with tax collectors and sinners.

Scripture consistently presents Him as ready to give a reason for what He does (cf. <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>), grounding His defense in the very heart of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is not the healthy</b><p>&#8226; Jesus begins with the obvious: people in good health do not seek medical help.

All the three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, repeat it with very slight variations; it was evidently a favourite theme with the great first teachers who followed Christ. It has borne rich fruit in the Master's Church; for this vindication of Jesus of his conduct in going so often into the society of the moral waifs and strays of the population has been the real "foundation of all those philanthropic movements which enlist the upper classes of society in the blessed work of bending down to meet in love the lower classes, so that the snapped circle of humanity may be restored; it is the philosophy in a nutshell of all home and missionary operations" (Dr. Morrison, on <a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;[It is] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(Ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
