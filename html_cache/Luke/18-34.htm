Despite being with Jesus and witnessing His miracles and teachings, they often struggled to grasp the full significance of His words and actions. This reflects the spiritual blindness that can affect even those closest to divine truth. In the context of <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>, Jesus had just predicted His suffering, death, and resurrection, which was contrary to the disciples' expectations of a triumphant Messiah. This misunderstanding highlights the human tendency to interpret divine plans through personal biases and cultural expectations. The disciples' confusion is also a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy about people hearing but not understanding (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>The meaning was hidden from them,</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine purpose in their lack of understanding. It implies that God, in His sovereignty, had not yet revealed the full meaning of Jesus' mission to them. This hiddenness can be seen as a protective measure, as the disciples were not yet ready to bear the full weight of the knowledge of Jesus' impending suffering and death. It also points to the mystery of God's plan, which unfolds in His timing. This concept of hiddenness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/daniel/12-9.htm">Daniel 12:9</a>, where certain truths are sealed until the appointed time.<p><b>and they did not comprehend what He was saying.</b><br>The disciples' inability to comprehend is not just intellectual but spiritual. It underscores the necessity of divine revelation for true understanding. This lack of comprehension is a reminder of the limitations of human wisdom and the need for the Holy Spirit to illuminate the truths of God. After Jesus' resurrection, the Holy Spirit would open their minds to understand the Scriptures (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>), showing that comprehension of divine truths is ultimately a gift from God. This moment foreshadows the transformation that would occur at Pentecost, when the disciples would be empowered to understand and proclaim the Gospel boldly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His impending death and resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present with Him.

They could not persuade themselves that the hopes of an earthly Messianic glory in which they were to; share must positively Be given up. "We must learn to love Divine truths Before we can understand them," said Pascal.
