The "house of God" signifies a sacred space where God's presence dwelt among His people. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>, David entered the tabernacle at Nob, where Ahimelech the priest was serving. This act underscores the importance of the tabernacle as a place of divine encounter and worship, and it highlights David's desperate situation as he fled from King Saul.<p><b>took the consecrated bread</b><br>The consecrated bread, also known as the "bread of the Presence" or "showbread," was a sacred offering placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle. According to <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>, twelve loaves were baked and placed before the Lord every Sabbath, symbolizing God's provision and the covenant relationship with the twelve tribes of Israel. Only priests were permitted to eat this bread, emphasizing its holiness and the sanctity of God's law. David's taking of the bread illustrates a moment where human need and divine law intersect, pointing to the principle that mercy can transcend ritual.<p><b>and gave it to his companions</b><br>David's sharing of the consecrated bread with his companions highlights the communal aspect of his leadership and the dire circumstances they faced. This act of sharing also reflects the biblical theme of provision and sustenance in times of need, reminiscent of God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness. It underscores the idea that God's mercy and provision extend beyond strict legalism, foreshadowing the New Testament teaching of Jesus on the Sabbath and mercy.<p><b>and ate what is lawful only for the priests to eat.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the legal restriction found in <a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>, where the bread of the Presence was designated solely for the priests. David's actions, therefore, were technically unlawful according to the Mosaic Law. However, this incident is used by Jesus in <a href="/luke/6-4.htm">Luke 6:4</a> to illustrate a deeper truth about the law's purpose and the precedence of human need over ritualistic observance. It points to the coming of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and embodies God's mercy, showing that the spirit of the law is love and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who was fleeing from King Saul.
