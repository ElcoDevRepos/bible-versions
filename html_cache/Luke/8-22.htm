The term "disciples" refers to the twelve apostles, who were chosen by Jesus to learn from Him and carry on His mission. This setting is part of the broader narrative of Jesus' ministry in Galilee, where He performed miracles and taught the crowds. The phrase "one day" suggests a typical day in the life of Jesus and His followers, highlighting the ongoing nature of His ministry.<p><b>&#8220;Let us cross to the other side of the lake.&#8221;</b><br>The "lake" refers to the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in Israel, which was central to Jesus' ministry. This body of water is about 13 miles long and 8 miles wide, surrounded by hills, making it prone to sudden storms. Crossing to the "other side" indicates a movement from the predominantly Jewish region to the more Gentile areas, reflecting Jesus' mission to reach all people. This journey foreshadows the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>.<p><b>So He got into a boat with them</b><br>Boats were a common mode of transportation for fishermen on the Sea of Galilee, and several of Jesus' disciples, like Peter, James, and John, were fishermen by trade. This detail underscores the practical aspects of Jesus' ministry, using familiar means to accomplish His purposes. The act of getting into the boat with His disciples symbolizes Jesus' presence and guidance in their lives, a theme echoed in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, where Jesus promises to be with His followers always.<p><b>and set out.</b><br>This phrase marks the beginning of a journey, both literal and metaphorical. The act of setting out signifies obedience to Jesus' command and trust in His leadership. It also prefigures the journey of faith that all believers are called to undertake, trusting in Jesus amidst life's uncertainties. This journey across the lake sets the stage for the subsequent miracle of calming the storm, demonstrating Jesus' authority over nature and His divine power, as seen in parallel accounts in <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-27</a> and <a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God and the teacher of His disciples.

Their relationship is based on trust and obedience, fulfilling the pattern Jesus later affirms: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing disciples rather than crowds, Jesus shows that deeper lessons in faith often occur in the smaller circle of committed followers (<a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let us cross to the other side of the lake.&#8221;</b><p>The command carries promise: &#8220;let us.&#8221; He does not send them alone; He goes with them.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;other side&#8221; points toward the Gentile region of the Decapolis (<a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1</a>).

Each crossing demanded faith that God would sustain.<p>&#8226; Jesus already knows the storm that awaits (<a href="/luke/8-23.htm">Luke 8:23-24</a>).
