The chief priests were part of the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish council, responsible for religious decisions and maintaining order. The rulers included both Jewish leaders and Roman authorities, indicating a collaboration between religious and political powers. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the established religious order, as He challenged their interpretations and practices. The involvement of these leaders fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers conspire against the Lord's Anointed.<p><b>delivered Him up</b><br>The act of delivering Jesus to the authorities signifies betrayal and rejection by His own people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>. This delivery was not just a legal handover but a spiritual rejection of the Messiah. It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>). The term "delivered" is significant in the New Testament, often used to describe the handing over of Jesus to His fate, emphasizing the divine plan and human responsibility.<p><b>to the sentence of death</b><br>The sentence of death was a result of the trial before the Sanhedrin and later before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. The Jewish leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy, while the Roman authorities charged Him with claiming to be a king, a political threat. This dual accusation highlights the intersection of religious and political motives in Jesus' condemnation. The death sentence fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant being "cut off from the land of the living."<p><b>and they crucified Him</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, particularly those guilty of treason or insurrection. It was a brutal and public form of punishment, intended to serve as a deterrent. The crucifixion of Jesus is central to Christian theology, symbolizing the atonement for sin and the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. The act of crucifixion also typifies Jesus as the Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice brings salvation to humanity, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who played a significant role in the trial and condemnation of Jesus.
