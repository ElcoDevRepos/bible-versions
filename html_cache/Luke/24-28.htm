The journey to Emmaus occurs on the same day as Jesus' resurrection, highlighting the immediate aftermath of the pivotal event. The village's proximity to Jerusalem is significant, as it underscores the centrality of Jerusalem in the unfolding of the resurrection narrative. The disciples' journey symbolizes a transition from despair to revelation, as they move from the place of Jesus' crucifixion to a place of understanding and recognition.<p><b>where they were headed</b><br>The destination of Emmaus is significant in that it represents a place of retreat and reflection for the disciples. Historically, Emmaus is not prominently mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, which suggests that its importance lies more in the narrative of the resurrection than in its geographical or historical significance. The disciples' intention to reach Emmaus indicates their desire to process the recent events in Jerusalem, including the crucifixion and reports of the resurrection. This journey reflects the human tendency to seek understanding and solace in times of confusion and grief.<p><b>He seemed to be going farther</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jesus, who has been walking with the disciples, gives the impression of continuing beyond their destination. This action can be seen as a test of the disciples' hospitality and desire for further revelation. In the cultural context of the time, hospitality was a valued virtue, and travelers were often invited to stay as a sign of friendship and respect. Jesus' seeming intention to go farther invites the disciples to extend an invitation, which they do, leading to the eventual revelation of His identity. This moment foreshadows the disciples' growing understanding and recognition of Jesus, paralleling other scriptural instances where Jesus tests the faith and understanding of His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ, who is walking with two of His disciples on the road to Emmaus, revealing Himself through the Scriptures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_disciples.htm">Two Disciples</a></b><br>Cleopas and another unnamed disciple, who are traveling to the village of Emmaus, discussing the recent events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village approximately seven miles from Jerusalem, serving as the destination for the disciples' journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>The setting for this significant post-resurrection appearance of Jesus, where He explains the Scriptures concerning Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city from which the disciples are departing, still reeling from the events of Jesus' death and reports of His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture.htm">The Importance of Scripture</a></b><br>Jesus uses the Scriptures to reveal Himself to the disciples.

We picture the risen Christ walking side-by-side with the two discouraged disciples.<p>&#8226; Their seven-mile journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus is nearly over (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13</a>). The pace has been slow enough for a long conversation about Moses, the Prophets, and &#8220;all the Scriptures&#8221; that testify about Him (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often paints decisive moments at a threshold&#8212;think of Abraham stopping at the edge of Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>) or Jesus pausing to weep as He nears Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>). The approach to Emmaus is another such hinge: the Lord is about to reveal Himself, but only after their invitation.<p>&#8226; That physical nearness underscores the reality of the resurrection body. Just as Thomas would later touch His wounds (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>), these two see dust on His sandals and hear His footsteps on the road.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where they were headed</b><p>The phrase reminds us that Jesus meets people exactly where their lives are actually going.<p>&#8226; Cleopas and his companion are headed home, carrying shattered hopes (<a href="/luke/24-17.htm">Luke 24:17-21</a>). The Lord joins their path before redirecting their hearts.<p>&#8226; This echoes His earlier ministry pattern&#8212;sitting at Levi&#8217;s tax booth (<a href="/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27-29</a>), resting by Jacob&#8217;s well for the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4-7</a>). He intersects ordinary routes to unveil extraordinary truth.<p>&#8226; Notice the divine courtesy: He respects their destination. <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a> says, &#8220;He guides me in paths of righteousness.&#8221; Guidance does not erase personality or personal plans; instead, He shepherds those plans to reveal Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He seemed to be going farther</b><p>The narrative tension peaks: &#8220;He seemed to be going farther.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord never feigns deceit, so the &#8220;seeming&#8221; signals an invitation, not trickery. Similar moments appear when He pretends to pass by the terrified disciples on the stormy sea (<a href="/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48-50</a>) or when He appears to walk past blind Bartimaeus (<a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46-48</a>). Each time, His apparent departure sparks a faith response.<p>&#8226; Jesus waits to be invited. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> portrays the same stance: &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock.&#8221; He does not force fellowship; He draws it out through longing hearts.<p>&#8226; The disciples, still unaware of His identity, urge Him, &#8220;Stay with us&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29</a>). Their hospitality becomes the doorway to recognition when &#8220;He took the bread, blessed it and broke it and gave it to them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>). Communion follows invitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-28.htm">Luke 24:28</a> shows the risen Christ walking right to the threshold of ordinary life, respecting the disciples&#8217; chosen path, and then appearing ready to move on until invited to stay. The verse highlights His bodily resurrection, His personal courtesy, and His desire for voluntary fellowship&#8212;truths that invite us to extend the same heartfelt welcome today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">He made as though he would have gone further.</span>--This was, it is obvious, the crucial test of the effect of the Lord's previous teaching. Did they feel a new light flowing in upon their souls, bringing new meanings into what had before been obscure and hard sayings? Were they content to let the unknown Teacher pass on, and see no more of Him? Their answer showed, in words that meet us afterwards, that their "hearts" already "burnt within them." Here, also, we note the method of the Divine Teacher as an example for other teachers. We often impress truth more effectively, and 'stimulate the desire for further knowledge, by suspending for a time the continued inculcation of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went:</span> <span class="cmt_word">and he made as though he would have gone</span> further.

"How many are there," says Stier, "to whom he has drawn near, but <span class="accented">with</span> whom he has not tarried, because they have suffered him to 'go away again,' in his living and heart-moving words! How comparatively rare is it for men to reach the full blessing they might receive (see, for example, the striking historical instance, <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14, 19</a>)!" But these were not content to let the unknown Teacher pass on, and see no more of him, and hear no more of his strange powerful teaching. It is the words of, and the thought contained in, this verse which suggested the idea of the well-known hymn - <p><span class="accented">"Abide with me; fast falls the eventide."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they approached</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#947;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;ngisan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1448.htm">Strong's 1448: </a> </span><span class="str2">Trans: I bring near; intrans: I come near, approach.
