The context is a warning against hypocrisy and the fear of human persecution. The phrase "I will show you" indicates Jesus' authority and knowledge, guiding His followers to a proper understanding of fear. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, highlighting the importance of reverence for God.<p><b>Fear the One who, after you have been killed,</b><br>Here, Jesus contrasts the temporary power of humans with the eternal authority of God. Humans can kill the body, but their power ends there. This reflects the cultural context of Roman-occupied Judea, where persecution and martyrdom were real threats. The phrase underscores the belief in life after death and the ultimate judgment by God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which speaks of judgment after death.<p><b>has authority to throw you into hell.</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Gehenna," a reference to the Valley of Hinnom near Jerusalem, historically associated with idolatry and child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). By Jesus' time, it symbolized the final place of punishment for the wicked. This phrase emphasizes God's ultimate authority over eternal destiny, reinforcing the seriousness of divine judgment and the need for repentance, as echoed in <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>.<p><b>Yes, I tell you, fear Him!</b><br>The repetition of "fear Him" serves to reinforce the message's urgency and importance. Jesus is not advocating for a fear that leads to terror but a reverent awe and respect for God's power and holiness. This echoes the call to fear God found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>, which concludes with the admonition to fear God and keep His commandments. This fear leads to obedience and trust in God's sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowd, teaching them about the proper object of fear.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being instructed on whom to fear and why.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Referred to as "the One" who has the power to cast into hell, emphasizing His ultimate authority and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hell.htm">Hell (Gehenna)</a></b><br>The place of final punishment, derived from the Greek word "Gehenna," which originally referred to a valley near Jerusalem used as a garbage dump, symbolizing a place of destruction and judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group present during Jesus' teaching, who also hear this message about fearing God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/proper_fear.htm">Proper Fear</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that our fear should be directed towards God, who holds eternal authority, rather than temporary human threats.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding the eternal consequences of our actions should guide our daily decisions and priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_awe.htm">Reverence and Awe</a></b><br>The fear of God is not just about being afraid but involves reverence, awe, and respect for His holiness and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_grace.htm">Judgment and Grace</a></b><br>While God has the power to judge, He also offers grace and salvation through Jesus Christ, which should lead us to repentance and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_accountability.htm">Living with Accountability</a></b><br>Recognizing God's ultimate authority should encourage us to live with accountability, knowing that our actions have eternal significance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_12_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 12:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_5_Fear_God_not_man.htm">How does Luke 12:5 emphasize the importance of fearing God over man?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_fear_Him_teach_on_God_s_power.htm">What does "fear Him who has authority" teach about God's ultimate power?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Using_God_s_fear_in_daily_choices.htm">How can we apply the fear of God in daily decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_12_5_Prov_9_10_on_fear.htm">How does Luke 12:5 connect with Proverbs 9:10 about the fear of the Lord?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_fearing_God_boost_faithfulness.htm">In what ways can fearing God lead to a more faithful Christian life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_5_on_God_s_life-death_authority.htm">What does Luke 12:5 reveal about God's authority over life and death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_5_Rethink_fear_and_reverence.htm">How does Luke 12:5 challenge our understanding of fear and reverence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_fearing_God_in_Luke_12_5.htm">Why does Jesus emphasize fearing God in Luke 12:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_fearing_hell.htm">What does the Bible say about fearing hell?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_passion.htm">What does the Bible say about demons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_angels.htm">What does the Bible say about angels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_jesus'_life_and_teachings_fulfill_god.htm">How does Jesus' life and teachings fulfill God's promise?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 12:5 Mean</div><b>But I will show you whom you should fear</b><p>Jesus has just said, &#8220;Do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do no more&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>).

When we honor God first, every other fear loses its grip, and we discover the secure embrace of the One who both judges righteously and counts every hair on our heads (<a href="/luke/12-6.htm">Luke 12:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell;</span> literally, <span class="accented">into Gehenna.</span> This is simply <span class="accented">Gee-hinnom</span>, "valley of Hinnom," translated into Greek letters&middot; This valley was situated in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, and originally was noted for the infamous rites practiced there in the worship of Moloch, in the times of the idolatrous kings of Judah. King Josiah, to mark his abhorrence of the idol-rites, defiled it with corpses; fires were subsequently kindled to consume the putrefying matter and prevent pestilence. The once fair valley, thus successively defiled with hideous corrupting rites, by putrefying corpses, and then with blazing fires lit to consume what would otherwise have occasioned pestilence, was taken by rabbinical writers as a symbol for the place of torment, and is used not unfrequently as a synonym for "hell." The translators of the Authorized Version have done so here. The reminder is, after all, we need not fear men. When they have done their worst, they have only injured or tortured the perishable body. The One whom all have good reason to fear is God, whose power is not limited to this life, but extends through and beyond death. Some have strangely supposed, not <span class="accented">God</span>, but the <span class="accented">devil</span>, is intended here to be the real object of human fear. The devil can be no object of fear to the Master's disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will show</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(hypodeix&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5263.htm">Strong's 5263: </a> </span><span class="str2">To indicate, intimate, suggest, show, prove.
