The return of the brother signifies repentance and reconciliation. In the cultural context of the time, a family member returning after squandering wealth would be a significant event, often met with mixed emotions. The brother's return symbolizes the sinner's return to God, highlighting themes of forgiveness and grace. The speaker is a servant, relaying the news to the older brother, which sets the stage for the older brother's reaction and the broader message of the parable about God's inclusive love.<p><b>&#8216;and your father has killed the fattened calf,</b><br>The fattened calf was reserved for special occasions, indicating a celebration of great importance. In ancient Jewish culture, meat was not consumed regularly, and the fattened calf was a symbol of abundance and festivity. This act by the father represents the joy and celebration in heaven over one sinner who repents, as seen in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>. The father's actions reflect God's extravagant grace and willingness to forgive and restore those who return to Him.<p><b>because he has him back safe and sound.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "safe and sound" emphasizes the complete restoration of the son, not just physically but relationally and spiritually. This mirrors the biblical theme of salvation and redemption, where God restores those who are lost. The father's joy is a reflection of God's joy over the repentance of sinners, as seen in the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin earlier in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>. The restoration is not just a return to the previous state but an elevation to a place of honor and acceptance, illustrating the transformative power of God's love and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_older_brother.htm">The Older Brother</a></b><br>Represents those who may feel resentment or jealousy when others receive grace or blessings, especially when they perceive themselves as more deserving.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_younger_brother.htm">The Younger Brother (Prodigal Son)</a></b><br>Symbolizes sinners who repent and return to God, experiencing His grace and forgiveness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who is loving, forgiving, and eager to welcome back those who repent.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Acts as the messenger, informing the older brother of the celebration and the return of the younger brother.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fattened_calf.htm">The Fattened Calf</a></b><br>A symbol of celebration and abundance, representing the joy and generosity of the father upon the return of his lost son.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_grace.htm">Understanding Grace</a></b><br>The father's reaction to the prodigal son's return is a powerful illustration of God's grace.

Our response to God&#8217;s rescuing love should mirror the father&#8217;s heart, not the elder brother&#8217;s reluctance (<a href="/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/15-27.htm">Luke 15:27</a> captures the gospel in miniature: a lost sinner becomes a restored brother;
