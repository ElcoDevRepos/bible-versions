Galilee was a significant area for Jesus' ministry, as it was home to many Gentiles and Jews, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about a great light shining in Galilee (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>). Jesus' return to Galilee follows His baptism and temptation in the wilderness, indicating a transition from preparation to active ministry. Galilee was known for its fertile land and diverse population, making it a strategic location for spreading His message.<p><b>in the power of the Spirit</b><br>This emphasizes the divine empowerment Jesus received from the Holy Spirit, which was evident after His baptism (<a href="/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21-22</a>). The Holy Spirit's presence signifies God's approval and anointing for His mission. This empowerment is crucial for understanding Jesus' authority in teaching, healing, and performing miracles. It also connects to the Old Testament concept of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon individuals for specific tasks (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>and the news about Him spread</b><br>The rapid spread of news about Jesus highlights the impact of His teachings and miracles. In a time without modern communication, word of mouth was the primary means of spreading information. Jesus' actions and teachings were so compelling that they quickly became the talk of the region. This phrase underscores the growing interest and curiosity about Jesus, setting the stage for both acceptance and opposition.<p><b>throughout the surrounding region</b><br>This indicates the geographical reach of Jesus' early ministry. The surrounding region includes not only Galilee but also areas like Judea and beyond. The spread of news throughout these regions fulfills the anticipation of a coming Messiah and prepares the way for Jesus' broader ministry. It also reflects the interconnectedness of communities in the ancient Near East, where news could travel quickly despite the lack of modern technology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who has just returned from His temptation in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel where Jesus began His public ministry.

This move shows purposeful ministry, not random wandering (cf. <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>; <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43-45</a>).<p>&#8226; His return demonstrates obedience to the Father&#8217;s timetable&#8212;He is never driven by fear of Herod or Satan but led by divine direction.<p>&#8226; The literal journey anchors the narrative in real geography. Galilee is no mythic backdrop; it is the soil that will first receive the public light of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> fulfilled in <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the power of the Spirit</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the power of the Spirit&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>)<p>&#8226; Luke has already emphasized the Spirit&#8217;s presence at Jesus&#8217; conception (1:35), baptism (3:22), and testing (4:1). Now that same Spirit empowers every step of His ministry (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights supernatural enablement, not mere human momentum. Everything Jesus teaches, heals, rebukes, or liberates flows from perfect harmony with the Spirit.<p>&#8226; For believers, this underscores that effective service depends on the same Spirit&#8217;s power, not on talent or charisma (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding region</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding region.&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>)<p>&#8226; Word travels quickly when authentic authority meets genuine compassion (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23-24</a>; <a href="/mark/1-28.htm">Mark 1:28</a>; <a href="/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The spread is spontaneous; no marketing plan is needed when God&#8217;s anointed One acts openly.<p>&#8226; This notoriety fulfills prophetic expectation that nations will be drawn to Messiah&#8217;s light (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; It also sets the stage for varied responses&#8212;wonder, curiosity, opposition&#8212;yet all under God&#8217;s sovereign purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a> pictures the Messiah stepping back into Galilee under the Spirit&#8217;s dynamic power, launching a ministry so unmistakably divine that news of Him cannot be contained.

Between the events of the temptation and the preaching at Nazareth here related, some considerable time had intervened. St. John, in his Gospel, gives a somewhat detailed account of this period which St. Luke omits. Shortly after the temptation, took place the concluding incidents in the Baptist's career, which St. Luke summarized in his brief statement (<a href="/luke/3-19.htm">Luke 3:19, 20</a>), when he tells us of the arrest and imprisonment of the fearless preacher by the Tetrarch Herod. St. John tells how the Sanhedrin sent some special envoys to the Baptist, asking him formally <span class="accented">who he really was</span>. After this questioning, John in his Gospel mentions the calling of Andrew, Simon, Philip, and Nathanael, and then records the first miracle of Jesus at Cana in Galilee, and how the Lord visited Capernaum. He then proceeds to relate some of the circumstances which took place at the Passover at Jerusalem, and how the Lord drove out the men who profaned his Father's house. He writes down, too, the particulars of Nicodemus the Pharisee's visit to Jesus by night. The Master then proceeded, as is here related by St. Luke, "in the power of the Spirit," who descended on him formally at his baptism, into Galilee, and on his journey thither tarried at Samaria, resting on the well there, and talking with the woman in those memorable words recorded by St. John at length in his fourth chapter (vers. 4-42). Rapidly the report of what he had done at Cana, the fame of his marvellous words at Jerusalem, Samaria, and other places, spread through all the central districts of the Holy Land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hypestrepsen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5290.htm">Strong's 5290: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, return.
