Jericho was a prosperous trade center during Jesus' time, known for its palm trees and balsam groves. Jesus' journey through Jericho is part of His final trip to Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of His mission and the divine timing of His encounters.<p><b>He looked up and said</b><br>Jesus' action of looking up signifies His awareness and intentionality. Despite the crowd, Jesus notices Zacchaeus, demonstrating His ability to see beyond physical appearances and social status. This reflects God's omniscience and personal attention to individuals, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God knows each person intimately.<p><b>&#8220;Zacchaeus, hurry down</b><br>By calling Zacchaeus by name, Jesus shows His personal knowledge and care for him, echoing the shepherd's call in <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, where the sheep recognize the shepherd's voice.

Staying at Zacchaeus' house signifies acceptance and fellowship, breaking cultural norms, as tax collectors were despised. This act prefigures the inclusivity of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>, where God shows no partiality.
