His blessing is significant as it acknowledges the divine purpose of Jesus. Blessings in Jewish tradition often conveyed God's favor and purpose. Simeon's blessing indicates the special role Jesus will play in God's plan.<p><b>and said to His mother Mary:</b><br>Simeon addresses Mary directly, highlighting her unique role in Jesus' life. This personal address underscores the intimate and profound impact Jesus' life and mission will have on her. Mary, as the mother of Jesus, is central to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>Behold, this Child is appointed</b><br>The term "appointed" suggests divine ordination. Jesus' life and mission are not random but are part of God's sovereign plan. This echoes Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child born with a divine purpose.<p><b>to cause the rise and fall of many in Israel,</b><br>Jesus' coming will be a turning point for Israel. The "rise" refers to those who will accept Him and find salvation, while the "fall" refers to those who will reject Him, leading to judgment. This dual outcome is consistent with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>, where the Messiah is both a sanctuary and a stone of stumbling.<p><b>and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</b><br>Jesus will be a sign from God, but one that is controversial and opposed. This opposition is seen throughout His ministry, as religious leaders and others reject Him. The prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as despised and rejected, aligns with this statement.

The Christ is seen by Simeon as the stone on which some fall and are bruised (<a href="/luke/20-18.htm" title="Whoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Luke 20:18</a>), while others plant their feet upon it and rise to a higher life.

(Comp. <a href="/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

He was to endure the "contradiction" of sinners (<a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm" title="For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.">Hebrews 12:3</a>). There is probably a reference also to the words of Jehovah (<a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm" title="I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;">Isaiah 65:2</a>) stretching forth his hands to a "gainsaying" people. The whole history of our Lord's ministry--one might almost say, of His whole after-work in the history of Christendom--is more or less the record of the fulfilment of Simeon's prediction. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this Child</span>. It is noticeable that, while Simeon blesses Mary and Joseph, he refrains from blessing the Child, of whom, however, he pointedly speaks. It was not for one like Simeon to speak words of blessing over "the Son of the Highest." The words which follow are expressly stated to have been addressed only to Mary. Simeon knew that she was related - but not Joseph - to the Babe in his arms; he saw, too, that her heart, not Joseph's, would be pierced with the sword of many sorrows for that Child's sake. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, this Child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against</span>. For nearly three centuries, of course with varying intensity, the name of Jesus of Nazareth and his followers was a name of shame, hateful and despised. Not only among the Roman idolaters was "the Name" spoken against with intense bitterness (see the expressions used by men like Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny), but also among his own nation, the Jews, was Jesus known as "the Deceiver," "that Man," "the Hung." These were common expressions used in the great rabbinical schools which flourished in the early days of Christianity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Simeon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Syme&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4826.htm">Strong's 4826: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simeon or Simon.
