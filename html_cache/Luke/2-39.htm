After Jesus' birth, they fulfilled the requirements of the Law, which included circumcision on the eighth day (<a href="/luke/2-21.htm">Luke 2:21</a>) and the purification rites for Mary, as well as the presentation of Jesus at the temple (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>). This obedience underscores their piety and faithfulness to God's commandments, setting a foundation for Jesus' own adherence to the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The Law of the Lord refers to the Torah, which was central to Jewish life and worship.<p><b>they returned to Galilee</b><br>Galilee was a region in northern Israel, known for its fertile land and diverse population. It was less politically and religiously significant than Judea, where Jerusalem is located. Returning to Galilee indicates a move from the religious center of Judaism back to a more rural and less prominent area.

Its obscurity is noted in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, where Nathanael asks, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" This reflects the humble and unexpected nature of Jesus' upbringing. Archaeological evidence suggests Nazareth was a small agricultural village during the first century. The return to Nazareth fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where the Messiah is referred to as a "Branch" (Hebrew: "netzer"), symbolizing new growth from the line of

2:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Their obedience is exhaustive&#8212;&#8220;everything&#8221; God asked was carried out without omission. Compare Joseph&#8217;s earlier promptness in naming the Child on the eighth day (<a href="/luke/2-21.htm">Luke 2:21</a>) and his later readiness to heed angelic warnings (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently applauds full obedience, not partial (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>; <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). Mary and Joseph model the wholehearted submission God seeks from every household (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>required by the Law of the Lord</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;Law of the Lord&#8221; refers to the commands given through Moses. For a firstborn male that included circumcision on the eighth day (<a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>), presentation and redemption at the temple (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15&#8211;16</a>), and a purification offering for the mother (<a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; By meeting these demands, the family affirms that the Law is good and binding. Jesus, though sinless, is intentionally placed under the Law from infancy (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment foreshadows Christ&#8217;s later declaration, &#8220;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). His fulfillment begins here through the obedience of His earthly parents.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they returned to Galilee</b><p>&#8226; After completing their Jerusalem obligations, the family heads north. Luke&#8217;s concise wording leaves room for the intervening flight to Egypt recorded by Matthew (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13&#8211;15</a>). Taken together, the Gospels show a round-trip that ultimately lands them back in Galilee.<p>&#8226; Galilee, often dubbed &#8220;Galilee of the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>), is a region of mixed populations. Jesus will grow up amid cultural crossroads, preparing Him for a ministry that reaches far beyond Israel&#8217;s borders (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to their own town of Nazareth</b><p>&#8226; Nazareth is Joseph and Mary&#8217;s hometown (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26&#8211;27</a>). Returning there highlights God&#8217;s pattern of working through humble settings (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> contrasted with Bethlehem&#8217;s smallness; <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>&#8217;s &#8220;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Matthew notes that this residence fulfills what was spoken through the prophets: &#8220;He will be called a Nazarene&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). Though no single Old Testament verse states this, the prophetic theme of Messiah&#8217;s lowliness is unmistakable (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Growing up in Nazareth, Jesus experiences ordinary village life&#8212;He learns a trade (<a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>) and is known by neighbors&#8212;yet He is the eternal Son whose origins are &#8220;from ancient times&#8221; (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-39.htm">Luke 2:39</a> records a simple return trip, yet every phrase underscores profound truth. Mary and Joseph obey completely, submitting the infant Messiah to every ordinance God gave. Their faithfulness marks the opening moves of Jesus&#8217; lifelong fulfillment of the Law. By steering back to Galilee and specifically to Nazareth, God roots His redemptive plan in an uncelebrated corner of Israel, displaying that His glory often dawns in humble places.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">They returned into Galilee.</span>--Filling up the narrative from St. Matthew, we have to insert after the Presentation, the visit of the Magi, the massacre of the Infants, and the flight into Egypt. It seems probable that St. Luke was not acquainted with St. Matthew's narrative, nor St. Matthew with St. Luke's. Each wrote from what he heard, or found in previous existing narratives, more or less incomplete, and hence cannot readily be brought into harmony with the other. Here the parents return to Nazareth as their own city. In St. Matthew the return appears to be determined by their fears of Archelaus. It is possible that, though previously domiciled at Nazareth, they may have thought of settling at Bethlehem, and were deterred from doing so by the cruelty of Herod and his son.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had performed all things according to the Law of the Lord.</span> Another note, which tells us of the rigid obedience which Mary and Joseph paid to the Law of Israel, under which they lived. Marcion, the famous Gnostic heretic (second century), who adopted this Gospel of St. Luke, to the exclusion of the other three, as the authoritative Gospel for his sect (the Marcionites), omitted, however, all these passages of St. Luke's narrative in which the old Mosaic Law was spoken of with reverence. <span class="cmt_word">They returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth</span>. To complete the story of our Lord's early life, we must insert from St. Matthew, before this return to Nazareth, the visit of the Magi, and the flight to and return from Egypt. It is probable - even if the Gospel of St. Matthew, as we have it, was not then written - that these details, the visit of the Magi and the flight into Egypt, were facts already well known to those whom this Gospel was especially designed to instruct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus&#8217; parents] had done</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(etelesan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5055.htm">Strong's 5055: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I end, finish, (b) I fulfill, accomplish, (c) I pay.
