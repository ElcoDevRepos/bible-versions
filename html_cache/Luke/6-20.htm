It suggests a teaching setting where Jesus is about to impart important truths. The act of looking up signifies attention and intention, emphasizing the importance of the message. In the cultural context, rabbis often taught their disciples in a direct and personal manner, which is consistent with Jesus' approach here.<p><b>Jesus said:</b><br>The authority of Jesus' words is central to this passage. As the Son of God, His teachings carry divine authority. This moment is part of the Sermon on the Plain, paralleling the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew, where Jesus delivers foundational teachings of the Christian faith. His words are not just for the disciples but for all who would follow Him.<p><b>Blessed are you who are poor,</b><br>The term "blessed" indicates a state of spiritual well-being and divine favor. In the biblical context, poverty is often associated with humility and dependence on God. The poor in spirit, as expanded in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, are those who recognize their need for God. This blessing is counter-cultural, as wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor in ancient times. Jesus redefines true blessedness as spiritual richness rather than material wealth.<p><b>for yours is the kingdom of God.</b><br>This promise assures the poor of their place in God's kingdom, a present and future reality. The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's rule and reign. It is both a present spiritual reality and a future hope. This statement echoes Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of good news to the poor. It also reflects the reversal of worldly values, where the last shall be first, and the first shall be last, as seen in <a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, delivering a sermon to His disciples and the gathered crowd.

The conclusion there arrived at--that the two discourses differ so widely, both in their substance and in their position in the Gospel narrative, that it is a less violent hypothesis to infer that they were spoken at different times than to assume that the two Evangelists inserted or omitted, as they thought fit, in reporting the same discourse--will be taken here as the basis of interpretation. It was quite after our Lord's method of teaching that He should thus reproduce, with more or less variation, what He had taught before. The English, "Blessed be ye poor," is ambiguous, as leaving it uncertain whether the words are the declaration of a fact or the utterance of a prayer. Better, <span class= "ital">Blessed are ye poor.</span> We note at once the absence of the qualifying words of St. Matthew's "poor <span class= "ital">in spirit."</span> Assume the identity of the two discourses, and then we have to think of St. Luke or his informant as omitting words, and those singularly important words, which our Lord had spoken; and this, it is obvious, presents a far greater difficulty than the thought that our Lord varied the aspects of the truths which He presented, now affirming the blessedness of the "poor in spirit," now that of those who were literally "poor," as having less to hinder them from the attainment of the higher poverty. See Notes on <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>. It seems to have been St. Luke's special aim to collect as much as he could of our Lord's teaching as to the danger of riches. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p>Note the substitution of the "kingdom of God" for the "kingdom of heaven" in St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-49.</span> - St. <span class="accented">Luke's report of the discourse of our Lord commonly termed the sermon on the mount.</span> We consider that the discourse contained in the following thirty verses (20-49) is identical with that longer "sermon on the mount" reported by St. Matthew (5.). Certain differences are alleged to exist in the framework of the two discourses. In St. Matthew the Lord is stated to have spoken it on the mountain; in St. Luke, in the plain. This apparent discrepancy has been already discussed (see above, on ver. 17). The "plain" of St. Luke was, no doubt, simply a level spot on the hillside, on the fiat space between the two peaks of the hill. The more important differences in the Master's utterances - of which, perhaps, one of the weightiest is the addition of St. Matthew to that first beatitude which explains <span class="accented">what</span> poor were blessed - the" poor in spirit " - probably arose from some questions put to the Master as he was teaching. In his reply he probably amplified or paraphrased the first utterance, which gave rise to the question; hence the occasional discrepancies in the two accounts. It is, too, most likely that many of the weightier utterances of the great sermon were several times reproduced in a longer or shorter form in the course of his teaching. Such repetitions would be likely to produce the differences we find in the two reports of the great sermon. The plan or scheme of the two Gospels was not the same. St. Luke, doubtless, had before him, when he compiled his work, copious notes or memoranda of the famous discourse. He evidently selected such small portions of it as fell in with his design. The two discourses reported by SS. Matthew and Luke have besides many striking resemblances - both beginning with the beatitudes, both concluding with the same simile or parable of the two buildings, both immediately succeeded by the same miracle, the healing of the centurion's servant. It is scarcely possible - when these points are taken into consideration - to suppose that the reports are of two distinct discourses. The theory held by some scholars, that the great sermon was delivered twice on the same day, on the hillside to a smaller and more selected auditory, then on the plain below to the multitude in a shorter form, is in the highest degree improbable. No portion of the public teaching of the Lord seems to have made so deep an impression as the mount-sermon. St. James, the so-called brother of Jesus, the first president of the Jerusalem Church, repeatedly quotes it in his Epistle. It was evidently the groundwork of his teaching in the first days. Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Ignatius, and Polycarp, the nameless author of the recently found 'Teaching of the Apostles,' whose writings represent to us most of the Christian literature which we possess of the first century after the death of St. Paul, quote it often. It may be taken, indeed, as the pattern discourse which mirrors better and mere fully than any other portion of the Gospels the Lord's teaching concerning the life he would have his followers lead. It is not easy to give a <span class="accented">precis</span> of such a report as that of St. Luke, necessarily brief, and yet containing, we feel, many of the words, and even sentences, in the very form in which the Lord spoke them. What we possess here is, perhaps, little more itself than a summary of the great original discourse to which the disciples and the people listened. Godet has attempted, and not unsuccessfully, to give a <span class="accented">resume</span> of the contents of St. Luke's memoir here. Still, it must be felt that any such work must necessarily be unsatisfactory. There appear to be three main divisions in the sermon: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A description of the persons to Whom Jesus chiefly addressed himself (vers. 20-26). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The proclamation of the fundamental principles of the new society (vers. 27-45). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> An announcement of the judgment to which the members of the new kingdom of God will have to submit (vers. 46-49). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God</span>; better rendered, <span class="accented">blessed are ye poor</span>, etc. It is the exact equivalent of the well-known Hebrew expression with which the Psalms begin: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which should be rendered, "Oh the blessedness of the man," etc.! This was probably the exact form in which Jesus began the sermon: "Blessed are the poor." He was gazing on a vast congregation mostly made of the <span class="accented">literally</span> poor. Those Standing nearest to him belonged to the masses - the fishermen, the carpenters, and the like. The crowd was mainly composed of the trading and artisan class, and they, at least <span class="accented">then</span>, were friendly to him, heard him gladly, came out to him from their villages, their poor industries, their little farms, their boats. The comparatively few rich and powerful who were present that day in the listening multitude were for the most part enemies, jealous, angry men, spying emissaries of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin, men who hated rather than loved the words and works of the Galilaean Teacher. The literally poor, then, represented the friends of Jesus; the rich, his enemies. But we may conceive of some like Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathaea, Gamaliel, or the wealthy patrician centurion, in that listening crowd, gently asking the Teacher as he taught, "Are only the poor, then, to be reckoned among thy blessed ones?" Some such question, we think, elicited the qualifying words of Matthew, "Blessed are the poor <span class="accented">in spirit</span>,' with some such underlying thought as, "Alas! this is not very often the character of the rich." It certainly was not while the Lord worked among men. While, then, the blessedness he spoke of belonged not to <span class="cmt_word">the</span> poor <span class="accented">because</span> they were poor, yet it seemed to belong to them especially as a class, because they welcomed the Master and tried to share his life, while the rich and powerful as a class did not. It runs indisputably all through the teaching of Paul and Luke, this tender love for the poor and despised of this world; full of warnings are their writings against the perils and dangers of riches. The awful parable of the rich man and Lazarus gathers up, in the story form best understood by Oriental peoples, that truth of which these great servants of the Redeemer were so intensely conscious, <span class="accented">that the poor stand better than the rich for the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God.</span> Not here, not now. Just a few drops from the river of joy which flows through that kingdom will sprinkle the life of his blessed ones while they live and struggle to do his will on earth; but the kingdom of God, in its full glorious signification, will be only enjoyed hereafter. It is an expression which includes citizenship in his city, a home among the mansions of the blessed, a place in the society of heaven, the enjoyment of the sight of God - the beatific vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Looking up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eparas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1869.htm">Strong's 1869: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise, lift up.
