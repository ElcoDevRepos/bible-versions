The "path" represents a hardened heart, where the word of God is heard but not understood or accepted. In the cultural context of ancient Palestine, paths were common in fields, where people walked and the ground became compacted, making it difficult for seeds to penetrate. This imagery illustrates how some people hear the gospel but remain spiritually unresponsive. The concept of hearing without understanding is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not comprehend.<p><b>but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual battle that occurs when the gospel is preached. The devil, referred to here, is a real adversary who actively works to prevent people from accepting the truth. In <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, the devil is described as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour, emphasizing his role in spiritual warfare. The removal of the word from their hearts signifies a lack of spiritual depth or protection, akin to the birds in the parable that eat the seeds. This reflects the immediate and aggressive nature of the devil's interference.<p><b>so that they may not believe and be saved</b><br>The ultimate goal of the devil's actions is to prevent belief and salvation. This phrase underscores the necessity of faith for salvation, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that it is by grace through faith that one is saved. The connection between belief and salvation is a central theme in the New Testament, with <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> affirming that whoever believes in Jesus will have eternal life. The phrase also serves as a warning about the consequences of a hardened heart and the importance of being receptive to the gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The speaker of the parable, teaching His disciples and the crowd about the Kingdom of God through the Parable of the Sower.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>- Represents the adversary who actively works to prevent people from accepting and retaining the Word of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path.htm">The Path</a></b><br>- Symbolizes the hearts of those who hear the Word but do not understand or accept it, making them vulnerable to the devil's influence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seeds.htm">The Seeds</a></b><br>- Represents the Word of God being sown into the hearts of people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hearers.htm">The Hearers</a></b><br>- Individuals who hear the Word but do not allow it to take root in their hearts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_heart.htm">Guard Your Heart</a></b><br>Be vigilant in protecting your heart from the devil's attempts to snatch away the Word.

It must be carefully borne in mind that in none of the four classes pictured in the parable are despisers of God, declared enemies of religion, portrayed. To these the gospel, with its warnings and its promises, rarely if ever speaks. These of "the wayside" are they whose hearts resemble a footpath, beaten hard and fiat by the constant passing to and fro of wishes of the flesh, of thoughts concerning earthly things, mere sordid hopes and fears. Into these hearts the Word can never really penetrate. Momentary influence now and again seems to have been gained, but the many watchful agents of the evil one, with swift wings, like birds of the air, swoop down and snatch away the scattered seed which for a moment seemed as though it would take root. Judas Iscariot the Jew, and Pontius Pilate the Roman, might be instanced as types of this class. These - before their awful fate - both <span class="accented">appeared</span> to have been moved. The one for long months followed the Lord and was trusted by him; the other pitied, and for a moment in his - Pilate's case - pity seemed passing into love and admiration, and tried to find a way of escape for the innocent Prisoner. But the one betrayed, and the other delivered to death, the sinless Son of God! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [ seeds ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
