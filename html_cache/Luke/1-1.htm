It suggests a widespread interest and effort among early Christians to preserve the accounts of Jesus' ministry. This reflects the importance of Jesus' life and the impact it had on those who witnessed it. The use of "many" implies that Luke was aware of other writings or oral traditions circulating at the time.<p><b>to compose an account</b><br>The term "compose" suggests a deliberate and organized effort to write down the events. This implies that Luke's Gospel is not a random collection of stories but a carefully structured narrative. The word "account" indicates a historical record, emphasizing the factual nature of the Gospel. This aligns with the purpose of the Gospels to provide a reliable testimony of Jesus' life and works.<p><b>of the things that have been fulfilled</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. It underscores the belief that Jesus' life and ministry were the realization of God's promises to Israel. The concept of fulfillment is central to the Gospel message, as it connects Jesus' actions to the divine plan revealed in the Scriptures. This also points to the continuity between the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>among us</b><br>The phrase "among us" indicates that the events described were witnessed by the community to which Luke belonged. It suggests a shared experience and collective memory of Jesus' life. This communal aspect reinforces the credibility of the account, as it is based on the testimony of multiple witnesses. It also emphasizes the incarnation, as Jesus lived and ministered among the people, making the divine accessible to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/luke.htm">Luke</a></b><br>The author of the Gospel of Luke, traditionally believed to be a physician and companion of the Apostle Paul.

The "many" <span class= "ital">may</span> have included St. Matthew and St. Mark, but we cannot say. There is no tone of disparagement in the way in which the writer speaks of his predecessors.

The Greek in which St. Luke's Gospel is written is generally pure and classical, but the language of the little introduction (verse 1-4) is especially studied and polished, and contrasts singularly with the Hebrew character of the story of the nativity, which immediately follows. St, Luke here, in this studied introduction, follows the example of many of the great classical writers, Latin as well as Greek. Thucydides, Herodotus, Livy, for instance, paid special attention to the opening sentences of their histories. The many early efforts to produce a connected history of the life and work of the great Master Christ are not, as some have supposed, alluded to here with anything like censure, but are simply referred to as being incomplete, as written without order or arrangement. They most probably formed the basis of much of St. Luke's own Gospel. These primitive Gospels quickly disappeared from sight, as they evidently contained nothing more than what was embodied in the fuller and more systematic narratives of the "four." <span class="cmt_word">Of those things which are most surely believed among us</span>. There was evidently no questioning in the Church of the first days about the truth of the story of the teaching and the mighty works of Jesus of Nazareth. It was the incompleteness of these first evangelists, rather than their inaccuracy, which induced St. Luke to take in hand a new Gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">have undertaken</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epecheir&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2021.htm">Strong's 2021: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take in hand, attempt.
