The setting is the courtyard of the high priest, where Jesus is being tried. The rapid succession of events highlights the pressure and fear Peter is experiencing. This timeframe is significant as it fulfills Jesus' prophecy that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crows (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>).<p><b>someone else saw him and said,</b><br>The presence of multiple witnesses in the courtyard suggests a crowded and tense environment. This person, like the servant girl before, recognizes Peter as a follower of Jesus. The repeated recognition by different individuals emphasizes Peter's association with Jesus, which he is now trying to deny. This reflects the social dynamics and the danger of being associated with a condemned man.<p><b>&#8220;You also are one of them.&#8221;</b><br>The accusation is direct and places Peter among the disciples of Jesus. The term "one of them" indicates a clear distinction between Jesus' followers and others present. This separation underscores the growing hostility towards Jesus and His followers. The phrase also connects to the broader theme of discipleship and the cost of following Christ, as seen in earlier teachings of Jesus (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p><b>But Peter said,</b><br>Peter's response is immediate and defensive. His denial is a stark contrast to his earlier bold declarations of loyalty to Jesus (<a href="/luke/22-33.htm">Luke 22:33</a>). This moment reveals Peter's human frailty and fear, serving as a reminder of the spiritual battle believers face. It also sets the stage for Peter's eventual repentance and restoration.<p><b>&#8220;Man, I am not.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's denial is emphatic and personal. The use of "Man" is a colloquial address, indicating his attempt to distance himself from the accusation. This denial fulfills Jesus' prophecy and highlights Peter's internal conflict. It serves as a poignant reminder of human weakness and the need for divine grace. Peter's denial is later contrasted with his powerful witness after the resurrection and Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-41</a>), demonstrating the transformative power of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later leadership in the early church.

Jesus had warned that the rooster would crow after three denials (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>), and the clock is ticking.<p>This brief interval underlines how temptation can strike repeatedly in close succession, just as Elijah faced wave after wave of threats from Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/19-1.htm">1 Kings 19:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Someone else saw him and said</b><p>A second observer now fixes on Peter.<p>&#8226;
