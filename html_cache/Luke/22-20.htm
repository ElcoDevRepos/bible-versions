The Last Supper is a Passover meal, a significant Jewish tradition commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. The timing after supper suggests a deliberate act, emphasizing the importance of what follows. The Passover meal itself is rich in symbolism, pointing to deliverance and sacrifice, which Jesus is about to fulfill.<p><b>He took the cup</b><br>The cup is a central element in the Passover meal, traditionally filled with wine. In Jewish tradition, the cup of wine is a symbol of joy and blessing, but it also has deeper meanings in the context of covenant and sacrifice. Jesus taking the cup signifies His role as the mediator of a new covenant, echoing the Old Testament practices where covenants were often ratified with blood sacrifices.<p><b>saying, &#8220;This cup is the new covenant in My blood</b><br>The term "new covenant" is a direct reference to <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new covenant with His people, distinct from the one made at Sinai. This covenant is characterized by an internal transformation and a personal relationship with God. Jesus identifies His blood as the means by which this new covenant is established, fulfilling the sacrificial system of the Old Testament and pointing to His role as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>which is poured out for you</b><br>The imagery of blood being poured out is reminiscent of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where the blood of animals was poured out as an atonement for sin (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' statement highlights the sacrificial nature of His death, emphasizing that it is for the benefit of others. This act of pouring out His blood is a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the suffering servant "poured out His life unto death" for the transgressors.

Luke echoes earlier words about the bread (v.19), showing that both elements point to the same saving act.<p>&#8226; This parallel underscores unity: Christ&#8217;s body and blood together accomplish redemption (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reflects Jesus&#8217; deliberate, orderly institution of the Lord&#8217;s Supper, not a casual gesture (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after supper He took the cup</b><p>&#8226; The cup follows the meal, separating it from ordinary eating and drinking (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; It likely corresponds to the Passover &#8220;cup of redemption,&#8221; linking Jesus&#8217; sacrifice to the Exodus deliverance (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By taking it in His own hands, Jesus takes ownership of the ancient sign and redefines it (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; Jesus interprets the symbol, ensuring His followers understand its meaning (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The spoken word, coupled with the visible sign, creates a tangible promise (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; His authority to redefine a covenant meal flows from being the promised Messiah (<a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This cup is the new covenant in My blood</b><p>&#8226;

own blood, giving it unbreakable permanence (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; The cup &#8220;is&#8221; (not merely represents) the covenant, meaning the ordinance truly conveys Christ&#8217;s finished work to believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal pronoun &#8220;My&#8221; stresses that Jesus alone provides the basis of the covenant; nothing is added by human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which is poured out for you</b><p>&#8226;

The phrase assures believers of substitutionary benefit: forgiveness (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>), reconciliation (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>), and eternal life (<a href="/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53&#8211;54</a>).<p>&#8226; It calls each participant to receive the cup with gratitude, confidence, and self-examination (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a> records Jesus deliberately transforming the Passover cup into a new-covenant sign.
