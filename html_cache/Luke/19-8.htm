Tax collectors were despised by the Jews for collaborating with the Roman occupiers. His standing up signifies a public declaration, showing a change of heart. This act of standing before Jesus, whom he calls "Lord," indicates recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity, aligning with the transformation seen in other biblical figures who encounter Christ.<p><b>Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor</b><br>Zacchaeus' offer to give half of his wealth to the poor demonstrates genuine repentance and a radical shift in priorities. In Jewish culture, almsgiving was a significant act of righteousness, but giving away half of one's wealth was extraordinary. This act reflects the teachings of Jesus on wealth and generosity, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>, where Jesus advises the rich young ruler to sell his possessions and give to the poor.<p><b>and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold</b><br>The promise to repay fourfold goes beyond the requirements of the Mosaic Law, which prescribed a restitution of the principal amount plus one-fifth (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>) or double (<a href="/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>) in cases of theft. Zacchaeus' commitment to repay four times the amount reflects the influence of Roman law, which sometimes required quadruple restitution, and indicates a deep sense of justice and repentance. This mirrors the transformation expected in a believer's life, as seen in the story of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where true repentance leads to restoration and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zacchaeus.htm">Zacchaeus</a></b><br>A chief tax collector in Jericho, known for his wealth and his encounter with Jesus.

He literally rises in the presence of Jesus, signaling a shift from curiosity to conviction. His standing mirrors the healed paralytic who &#8220;stood up immediately&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-25.htm">Luke 5:25</a>), showing that genuine encounters with Jesus move people to visible action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to the Lord</b><p>The title &#8220;Lord&#8221; acknowledges Jesus&#8217; authority. Zacchaeus is no longer addressing a famous rabbi but the One he now recognizes as Master. Similar confessions appear in <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>, where Peter cries, &#8220;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&#8221; Both men move from self-interest to submission, illustrating that repentance begins with recognizing Christ&#8217;s rightful rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, Lord</b><p>&#8220;Look&#8221; invites inspection. Zacchaeus is not making a private vow; he calls Jesus (and by extension, the gathered crowd) to witness his intentions. This openness reflects <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>, &#8220;Test me, O LORD, and try me,&#8221; and anticipates <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>, &#8220;I will show you my faith by my deeds.&#8221; True repentance welcomes the light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>half of my possessions I give to the poor</b><p>&#8226; 50 percent is far beyond the Mosaic Law&#8217;s tithe (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>) and triples the 20 percent restitution for theft (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Zacchaeus voluntarily embraces the spirit of <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>, choosing generosity over greed.<p>&#8226; His pledge contrasts with the rich ruler of <a href="/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>, who walked away sorrowful; Zacchaeus joyfully loosens his grip on wealth, illustrating Jesus&#8217; teaching that &#8220;where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-34.htm">Luke 12:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if I have cheated anyone</b><p>The &#8220;if&#8221; is not evasive; it concedes real wrongdoing.

Zacchaeus echoes <a href="/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21-22</a>, where Job invites judgment if he exploited the vulnerable.

He fulfills Jesus&#8217; mission &#8220;to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>), proving that no one is beyond redemption when they respond with wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord . . .</span>--The word for "stood" is the same as that used in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>). Too much stress has, perhaps, been laid on its supposed force as indicating self-assertion in both cases. It does not seem to imply more than that Zacchaeus, in his own house, hearing the murmurs of those who looked in at doors or windows, rose from his couch, and stood up, and in the hearing of all, said what follows. The phrase, "unto the Lord," indicates, as elsewhere, that the facts were recorded by St. Luke at a comparatively late period. (See Note on <a href="/luke/7-11.htm" title="And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.">Luke 7:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The half of my goods I give</span> . .--It seems more natural to see in this the statement of a new purpose than that of an habitual practice. In the absence of any words implying a command of this nature, we must assume either that it was a spontaneous impulse of large-hearted devotion, or, possibly, that Zacchaeus had heard of the command given but a few days before to the young ruler (<a href="/luke/18-22.htm" title="Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.">Luke 18:22</a>). The promise implies immediate distribution. The compensation for wrongs that men might have suffered at his hands was to come out of the remaining half.<p><span class= "bld">If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation.</span>--The seven words of the English text are all needed to express the one Greek word, the same as that in <a href="/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>, where see Note. It is a pity that English usage, and the modern meaning of the words, do not allow us to say, "If I have <span class= "ital">sycophanted</span> any man." Conscience probably reproached Zacchaeus with not a few of such acts of spoliation in the past. The Greek phrase, "If I have taken anything," hardly implies doubt as to the fact, and is used like our English "wherever."<p><span class= "bld">I restore him fourfold.</span>--Here, also, it seems best to recognise in the words a new purpose. He is ready to compensate now for whatever wrong had been done before. There seems, indeed, something almost ludicrously incongruous in a devout man boasting that his rule of life is to make amends to those whom he deliberately cheats, and the special force of the verb practically excludes the idea of involuntary wrong. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Zacchaeus stood, and said</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</span> Zacchaeus's memorable speech was addressed not as an <span class="accented">apologia</span> to the murmuring, jealous crowd, either in the room or the courtyard of the house, but to his Divine Guest, who, he felt, understood him, whose great heart, he knew, sympathized with him in that life of his, so tempted and yet so full of quiet, noble acts; for the chief publican's words do not refer to a <span class="accented">future</span> purpose, but they speak of a <span class="accented">past</span> rule of life which he had set for himself to follow, and probably had followed for a long period. So Godet, who paraphrases thus: "He whom thou hast thought good to choose as thy host is not, as is alleged, a being unworthy of thy choice. Lo, publican though I am, it is no ill-gotten gain with which I entertain thee." In a profession like his, it was easy to commit involuntary injustice. There may, too, have been, probably was, many a hard if not an unjust act worked by the chief of the tax-gatherers and his subordinates in their difficult employment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Zacchaeus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#918;&#945;&#954;&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Zakchaios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2195.htm">Strong's 2195: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zacchaeus, a Jewish tax-gatherer.
