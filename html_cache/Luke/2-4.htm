Nazareth was a relatively obscure village, not mentioned in the Old Testament, which underscores the unexpected nature of God's plan. The phrase "went up" is geographically accurate, as traveling from Nazareth to Judea involves ascending in elevation. This journey fulfills the legal requirement for the census decreed by Caesar Augustus, demonstrating Joseph's obedience to civil authority.<p><b>to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the "city of David," is significant for its historical and prophetic importance. It is the birthplace of King David, Israel's greatest king, and is prophesied in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> as the birthplace of the Messiah. This connection to David emphasizes Jesus' rightful claim to the Davidic line, fulfilling God's promise of an eternal kingdom through David's descendants. Bethlehem's name, meaning "house of bread," symbolically points to Jesus as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>since he was from the house and line of David</b><br>Joseph's lineage is crucial in establishing Jesus' legal right to the throne of David. The genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> trace Jesus' ancestry through Joseph, affirming His messianic credentials. The "house and line of David" signifies the fulfillment of God's covenant with David, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, promising a ruler from David's line whose kingdom would endure forever.

The position in life of Joseph the royally descended, simply a village carpenter, the equally humble state of Mary, also one of the great king's posterity, need excite no surprise when the vicissitudes of that royal house, and of the people over whom they ruled, are remembered.

All that the house of David had preserved were its bare family records.
