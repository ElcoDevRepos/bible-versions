In biblical narratives, crying out often signifies a deep need or distress, as seen in the Psalms and the cries of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>&#8216;Father Abraham</b><br>Addressing Abraham as "Father" reflects the rich man's Jewish heritage, acknowledging Abraham as the patriarch of the Jewish people. This connection emphasizes the rich man's reliance on his lineage for favor, a common belief among Jews of the time, as seen in <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>.<p><b>have mercy on me</b><br>The request for mercy underscores the rich man's recognition of his helplessness and need for compassion. Mercy is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with God's character, as in <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>.<p><b>and send Lazarus</b><br>The mention of Lazarus, the poor man, highlights a reversal of roles. In life, the rich man ignored Lazarus, but now he seeks his help. This reflects the theme of reversal found in Jesus' teachings, such as in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>).<p><b>to dip the tip of his finger in water</b><br>This request for a minimal relief underscores the severity of the rich man's suffering. Water is often symbolic of life and refreshment in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of living water.<p><b>and cool my tongue</b><br>The focus on the tongue suggests intense physical torment. In biblical literature, the tongue can symbolize speech and desire, as seen in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>, where it is described as a powerful force.<p><b>For I am in agony in this fire</b><br>The imagery of fire represents judgment and suffering, consistent with biblical depictions of hell, such as in <a href="/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42</a>.

&#8220;Agony&#8221; confirms torment is continuous and intense (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire is portrayed as literal punishment prepared for the wicked (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene answers those who deny eternal punishment; Jesus presents it as undeniable reality (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a> portrays the irreversible fate of the unrepentant. The rich man&#8217;s conscious, fiery torment, his futile plea for mercy, and the glaring role reversal with Lazarus all underline three truths: earthly privilege cannot secure eternal life, opportunities for repentance end at death, and hell is a place of real, unrelieved suffering. The verse calls the living to heed God&#8217;s Word now, embracing the mercy that Christ freely offers before it is forever out of reach.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger . . .</span>--The words, in their relation to the effect of the punishment on the rich man's character, offer two tenable explanations. On the one hand, they have been thought to indicate the old selfish arrogance and heartlessness of the man who still looks on Lazarus as one who may be sent hither and thither, at any cost of suffering, to do his bidding and minister to his ease; on the other, we may see in them the traces of pride conquered, and the cry for mercy at last coming from lips that had never uttered it before, and the craving for help and sympathy from one whom in his lifetime he had despised as beneath his notice. There is something terribly significant in the fact that it is the "tongue" that suffers most in that agonising flame. That was the organ of the sense which the man had pampered by his riotous and sumptuous living: that is now the chief instrument of retribution. The lesson is the same as that which a poet of our own has taught us--<p>"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices<p>Make instruments to scourge us."--<p>Shakespeare, <span class= "ital">King Lear,</span> v. 3.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame</span>. His intense longing seems to be for companionship. "Oh for a friend," he seems to say, "who could speak to me, comfort me, give me the smallest alleviation of the pain I suffer!" What picture of a hell was ever painted by man comparable to this vision of eternal solitude, peopled alone by remorseful memories, described by Jesus? As the Divine Speaker advanced in his thrilling, melancholy description of the rich man's condition in the world to come, how vividly must the listeners have recalled the Master's earnest advice to them, in his former parable of the steward, to make to themselves <span class="accented">while here</span> friends who would receive them into everlasting habitations! They saw the meaning of that detail of the parable then. Were <span class="accented">flay</span>, in their luxurious abundance, were <span class="accented">they</span> making friends here who would help them there in the eternal tents? Were they not, perhaps, making the same mistake as the rich man of the story? The question might be asked - Why is Abraham, the father of the chosen race, the centre of this blessed life in Hades? In reply, <span class="accented">firstly</span>, it must be remembered that the whole colouring of this parable is peculiarly rabbinic, and in the schools of the rabbis the life of the blessed in Paradise is represented as a banquet, over which, until Messiah come, Abraham is represented as presiding. And, <span class="accented">secondly</span>, when the parable was spoken, the Saviour was actually on earth; his great redemption work had still to be accomplished. There was truth as well as error mingled in that strange rabbinical teaching. Messiah, <span class="accented">as Messiah</span>, when the parable was being probably acted, had not entered that realm where Abraham and many another holy and humble man of heart were in the enjoyment of exquisite bliss. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
