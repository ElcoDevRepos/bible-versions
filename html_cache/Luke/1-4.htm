The author, traditionally identified as Luke the physician and companion of Paul, aims to provide assurance and clarity. The Greek word for "know" (&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8183;&#962;) suggests a deep, experiential understanding, not just intellectual knowledge. This reflects the biblical emphasis on knowing God personally, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> and <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>.<p><b>the certainty</b><br>The term "certainty" underscores the reliability and truthfulness of the Gospel message. In a historical context, Luke writes to Theophilus, likely a person of high status, to affirm the truth of the Christian faith amidst a world of competing philosophies and religions. This assurance is crucial for believers facing persecution or doubt, echoing the certainty of God's promises found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>.<p><b>of the things</b><br>This refers to the events and teachings concerning Jesus Christ. Luke's Gospel is meticulously researched, as indicated in the prologue (<a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1:1-3</a>), and aligns with the other synoptic Gospels. The "things" include Jesus' birth, ministry, death, and resurrection, which fulfill Old Testament prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, confirming Jesus as the promised Messiah.<p><b>you have been taught</b><br>The phrase implies that Theophilus, and by extension the readers, have already received instruction in the Christian faith. This reflects the early church's practice of catechesis, or religious instruction, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>. The teachings would have included the core tenets of the faith, such as the Apostles' Creed, and the ethical teachings of Jesus, emphasizing the continuity and consistency of the Gospel message from the apostles to the present.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/luke.htm">Luke</a></b><br>The author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. He was a physician and a companion of the Apostle Paul. Luke is known for his detailed and orderly account of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/theophilus.htm">Theophilus</a></b><br>The recipient of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. His name means "friend of God" or "loved by God." Theophilus may have been a Roman official or a person of high social standing who had received instruction in the Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel_of_luke.htm">The Gospel of Luke</a></b><br>One of the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament, it provides a detailed account of the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Luke's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' compassion and care for the marginalized.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/certainty.htm">Certainty</a></b><br>The Greek word used here is (asphaleia), which conveys a sense of security, safety, and assurance.

After gathering eyewitness accounts, he writes, &#8220;so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>). This &#8220;so that&#8221; signals intention: Luke wants Theophilus&#8212;and us&#8212;to move from secondhand hearsay to firsthand confidence. Other writers share this motive:<p>&#8226; John states his Gospel was written &#8220;so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter stresses he did not follow &#8220;cleverly devised myths&#8221; but true events (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul longs for believers &#8220;so that I may present you fully mature in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>).<p>These passages echo Luke&#8217;s heart: Scripture&#8217;s record is purposeful, aiming to ground faith in real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you may know</b><p>Luke&#8217;s next words zoom in on personal assurance: &#8220;you may know.&#8221; God does not leave us with vague impressions; He invites knowledge anchored in truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a> says, &#8220;I have written to you who believe&#8230; so that you may know that you have eternal life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a> reminds us that what was written &#8220;was written for our instruction, so that through endurance&#8230; we might have hope.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a> prays believers will attain &#8220;all the riches of full assurance of understanding.&#8221;<p>Knowledge here is relational and experiential&#8212;confidence that grows as we study and trust God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the certainty</b><p>The Greek term Luke uses points to stability, firmness, being unshakable. Scripture is not tentative; it is rock-solid.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a> calls hope in Christ &#8220;an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a> declares God &#8220;has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man He has appointed, and He has given proof to everyone by raising Him from the dead.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as &#8220;the assurance of what we hope for and the certainty of what we do not see.&#8221;<p>Luke wants readers to stand on a foundation that will not crack under cultural pressure or personal trial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the things</b><p>What &#8220;things&#8221; does Luke mean? The entire sweep of Jesus&#8217; birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and teachings. Verses 1-3 confirm Luke researched &#8220;the things that have been fulfilled among us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19-21</a> links these events with prophetic Scripture, ensuring that both the events and their interpretation come from God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-1.htm">Acts 1:1-3</a> notes Luke&#8217;s earlier volume (his Gospel) chronicled &#8220;all that Jesus began to do and teach,&#8221; grounding faith in verifiable acts.<p>In recording these &#8220;things,&#8221; Luke shows Christianity is anchored in historical reality, not abstract philosophy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have been taught</b><p>Theophilus had already received instruction; Luke writes to reinforce it. Ongoing teaching cements truth in hearts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14-15</a> urges, &#8220;Continue in what you have learned&#8230; for from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a> tells elders to &#8220;encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who contradict it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a> describes Apollos as &#8220;instructed in the way of the Lord,&#8221; yet still needing fuller accuracy.<p>Discipleship is a lifelong journey. Written Scripture undergirds oral teaching, ensuring what we believe remains faithful and precise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a> shows that God wants believers to possess settled assurance. Through carefully researched history, Spirit-inspired writing, and faithful teaching, we can know&#8212;not guess&#8212;the truth about Jesus Christ. Scripture provides an unshakeable foundation so that our faith is certain, our hope secure, and our lives grounded in the trustworthy acts and words of our Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Wherein thou hast been instructed.</span>--The verb used is that from which are formed the words "catechise," "catechumen." &c., and implies oral teaching--in its later sense, teaching preparatory to baptism.
