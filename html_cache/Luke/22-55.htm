The courtyard mentioned here is likely part of the high priest's residence, where Jesus was taken after His arrest. Fires were kindled for warmth, especially during the cool nights of early spring in Jerusalem. This setting provides a stark contrast between the warmth of the fire and the coldness of the events unfolding, as Jesus faces trial and Peter faces his own test of faith.<p><b>and sat down together</b><br>The act of sitting together around a fire suggests a communal atmosphere, yet it is also a setting of tension and uncertainty. Those gathered include servants and officers of the high priest, as well as others curious about the proceedings. This scene sets the stage for Peter's denial, highlighting the pressure of being in a hostile environment. The communal sitting contrasts with Peter's internal struggle, as he is physically present but spiritually conflicted.<p><b>Peter sat down among them</b><br>Peter's decision to sit among those in the courtyard is significant. It reflects his desire to remain close to Jesus, yet it also places him in a precarious position. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier prophecy that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crows (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>). Peter's presence among the group symbolizes the tension between his loyalty to Jesus and his fear of association with Him. This act of sitting among them foreshadows his impending denial, illustrating the human struggle between faithfulness and fear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later for his denial of Jesus during His trial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The setting where Peter's denial takes place, likely part of the high priest's residence where Jesus was being tried.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants_and_officers.htm">The Servants and Officers</a></b><br>Those who kindled the fire and sat around it, including those who would later recognize Peter as a follower of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fire.htm">The Fire</a></b><br>A literal fire providing warmth, symbolically representing the pressure and scrutiny Peter faced.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_denial.htm">The Denial</a></b><br>The event where Peter, out of fear, denies knowing Jesus, fulfilling Jesus' earlier prophecy about Peter's denial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_fear_and_peer_pressure.htm">The Danger of Fear and Peer Pressure</a></b><br>Peter's denial highlights how fear and the desire to fit in can lead us to compromise our faith.

Jesus had prayed, &#8220;I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). Peter will stumble but not be forsaken, a truth Peter later teaches others (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-55.htm">Luke 22:55</a> records more than scenery; it traces a spiritual crossroads. Servants light a fire for warmth, but its glow spotlights Peter&#8217;s shrinking courage. The courtyard is central, public, unavoidable&#8212;Peter cannot hide. Those seated together represent a world aligned against Jesus, and Peter chooses proximity over loyalty. The verse therefore illustrates how subtle compromises place believers in harm&#8217;s way, how prophecy unfolds with precision, and how the Savior&#8217;s intercession ultimately secures restoration even after failure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(55) <span class= "bld">When they had kindled a fire.</span>--The fire is mentioned by St. Luke in common with St. Mark and St. John.<p><span class= "bld">Of the hall.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">of the court-yard--"</span>hall" with us conveying the idea of a covered space inside the house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among</span> <span class="cmt_word">them.</span> We know that the arrest in Gethsemane was followed by the flight of the eleven apostles. John and Peter, however, once out of reach of the armed band, seem in some way to have recovered from their first panic, and to have followed their Master and his guards into the city. Arrived at the high priest's house, John, who was known to the high priest, had no difficulty in procuring admission for himself and his companion. Peter's motive in pressing into what he knew for him was a locality full of peril, is given by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-58.htm">Matthew 26:58</a>), "to see the end." There was no doubt there was in the heart of the impulsive, loving man, sorrowful anxiety and deep sorrow for his dear Master's fate. But, alas! with the feverish sad expectation to see what he felt would be the end, there was no earnest prayer for guidance and help. The fire is mentioned because, generally speaking, the nights in the Holy Land about the Passover season are warm. The cold on this night appears to be spoken of as something unusual. <span class="accented">Peter sat down among them.</span> "St. John (it must be supposed) had passed on into the audience-chamber, so that St. Peter was alone.
