The Greek word for "awe" can also be translated as "fear" or "reverence," indicating a profound respect and amazement at the divine power displayed. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's presence or actions elicit a similar response, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> when the Israelites saw the power of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians.<p><b>and they glorified God.</b><br>The crowd's response to glorify God reflects a recognition of divine intervention. In Jewish culture, glorifying God was a common response to witnessing His mighty works, as seen in Psalms 86:12 and <a href="/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>. This act of glorification acknowledges God's sovereignty and power, aligning with the biblical theme that all miracles ultimately point back to God as the source.<p><b>&#8220;A great prophet has appeared among us!&#8221; they said.</b><br>The declaration of Jesus as a "great prophet" connects Him to the tradition of Old Testament prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who also performed miracles, including raising the dead (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>, <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-37</a>). This recognition by the people suggests an understanding of Jesus as a significant figure in God's plan, though not yet fully grasping His identity as the Messiah. The expectation of a prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, may also be in view here.<p><b>&#8220;God has visited His people!&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the belief that God's presence and favor were manifest in Jesus' actions. The phrase "visited His people" echoes Old Testament language, such as in <a href="/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6</a> and <a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>, where God's intervention is seen as a visitation. This visitation is not just a temporary appearance but signifies God's ongoing involvement and care for His people, ultimately fulfilled in the incarnation of Jesus Christ. The concept of God visiting His people is also prophetic, pointing to the messianic hope found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing miracles and teaching, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Witnesses to Jesus' miracle, they respond with awe and glorification of God, recognizing Jesus as a great prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nain.htm">Nain</a></b><br>The town where the event takes place, highlighting Jesus' ministry in Galilee and His outreach to various communities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow_of_nain.htm">The Widow of Nain</a></b><br>A grieving mother whose son Jesus raises from the dead, showcasing His power over life and death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_raised_son.htm">The Raised Son</a></b><br>The young man who is brought back to life, serving as a testament to Jesus' divine power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_divine_authority.htm">Recognition of Divine Authority</a></b><br>The crowd's reaction underscores the importance of recognizing Jesus' divine authority and His role as a prophet and more.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion_and_presence.htm">God's Compassion and Presence</a></b><br>The miracle illustrates God's compassion and His active presence among His people, offering hope and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/response_of_awe_and_worship.htm">Response of Awe and Worship</a></b><br>The appropriate response to witnessing God's work is awe and worship, acknowledging His greatness and glorifying Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_power_over_life_and_death.htm">Faith in God's Power Over Life and Death</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to have faith in God's power over life and death, trusting in His sovereignty and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_and_testifying.htm">Witnessing and Testifying</a></b><br>Like the crowd, believers are called to testify to God's work in their lives, sharing the good news of His presence and power.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_7_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 7:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_7_16_How_does_it_inspire_awe.htm">How does Luke 7:16 inspire reverence and awe in your daily life?

They could not look on this quiet Rabbi-Physician, who gently put all state and pomp and glory aside, as the Divine Messiah; but that in Jesus Israel possessed a great Prophet the people were persuaded - they recognized that at last, after four long centuries of absence, God again had visited his people.
