The greatness of John the Baptist, as foretold by the angel Gabriel, is rooted in his role as the forerunner to the Messiah, preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). His greatness is not measured by earthly standards but by his obedience and faithfulness to God's calling. This echoes the biblical theme that true greatness is found in serving God's purposes (<a href="/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>).<p><b>He shall never take wine or strong drink,</b><br>This vow reflects the Nazirite lifestyle, a special consecration to God described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. Nazirites abstained from wine and strong drink as a sign of their dedication. John's abstinence underscores his prophetic role and separation for God's work. This lifestyle choice also connects him to figures like Samson (<a href="/judges/13-4.htm">Judges 13:4-5</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), who were similarly set apart for divine purposes.<p><b>and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother&#8217;s womb.</b><br>This unique filling of the Holy Spirit from the womb signifies John's extraordinary role in salvation history. It highlights the divine orchestration of his life and mission, emphasizing the Holy Spirit's work in empowering and guiding God's servants. This pre-birth filling is unparalleled, indicating John's pivotal role in heralding the coming of Christ. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of the Holy Spirit's indwelling presence in believers (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The subject of this verse, John is prophesied to be great in the sight of the Lord.

He was to be what Samson had been (<a href="/judges/13-4.htm" title="Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:">Judges 13:4</a>), and probably Samuel also (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1Samuel 1:11</a>), and the house of Jonadab the son of Rechab (<a href="/jeremiah/35-6.htm" title="But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons for ever:">Jeremiah 35:6</a>).
