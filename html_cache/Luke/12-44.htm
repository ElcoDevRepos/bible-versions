It is a common introductory phrase in the Gospels, often used to underscore the certainty and authority of Jesus' teachings. The use of "truly" (Greek: "amen") indicates that what follows is a trustworthy statement, reflecting Jesus' divine authority and the reliability of His words.<p><b>he will put him in charge</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the concept of stewardship and responsibility. In the biblical context, being put in charge implies a position of trust and authority. This reflects the parable's theme of faithful service and the reward that comes from it. The idea of stewardship is prevalent throughout Scripture, where God entrusts His servants with responsibilities, expecting them to manage His resources wisely and faithfully. This echoes the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where faithful servants are rewarded with greater responsibilities.<p><b>of all his possessions</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of the reward for faithful service. In the cultural and historical context of the time, possessions were a sign of wealth and status. Being entrusted with "all his possessions" signifies a high level of trust and honor. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual rewards and responsibilities given to believers who are faithful in their service to God. It also points to the eschatological promise of believers sharing in Christ's kingdom, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, where believers are described as co-heirs with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, offering teachings and parables to His disciples and the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_and_wise_manager.htm">Faithful and Wise Manager</a></b><br>The subject of the parable, representing those who are faithful in their duties and responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with responsibilities and rewards them for their faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize believers who are entrusted with responsibilities in God's kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/possessions.htm">Possessions</a></b><br>Symbolize the blessings and responsibilities given by God to His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>God values our faithfulness in the small responsibilities He gives us.
