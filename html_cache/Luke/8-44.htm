In the cultural context of first-century Judea, a woman suffering from a bleeding disorder would have been considered ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>). Her decision to come up behind Jesus suggests her awareness of societal norms and her desire to avoid drawing attention to herself. This act of coming from behind also signifies her faith, as she believed that even a secretive touch could heal her.<p><b>and touched the fringe of His cloak</b><br>The "fringe" refers to the tassels or tzitzit that Jewish men wore on the corners of their garments, as commanded in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>. These tassels were a reminder to follow God's commandments. By touching the fringe, the woman was not only reaching out for physical healing but also symbolically connecting with the divine authority and holiness that Jesus represented. This act can be seen as an acknowledgment of Jesus' fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>and immediately her bleeding stopped</b><br>The immediate cessation of her bleeding underscores the miraculous nature of the healing. In the context of the Gospels, Jesus' miracles often serve as signs of His divine authority and the in-breaking of God's kingdom. This instantaneous healing contrasts with the woman's twelve years of suffering and failed medical treatments (as noted in parallel accounts like <a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-26</a>). It demonstrates Jesus' power over physical ailments and His compassion for those marginalized by society. This miracle also prefigures the ultimate healing and restoration that Jesus offers through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A woman suffering from a chronic bleeding condition for twelve years, which made her ceremonially unclean according to Jewish law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people surrounding Jesus, making it difficult for the woman to approach Him directly.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fringe_of_his_cloak.htm">The Fringe of His Cloak</a></b><br>Refers to the tassels (tzitzit) on the corners of a Jewish garment, which were worn as a reminder of the commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>The miraculous healing that occurs when the woman touches Jesus' garment, demonstrating His divine power and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The woman's faith led her to take bold action despite societal and religious barriers.
