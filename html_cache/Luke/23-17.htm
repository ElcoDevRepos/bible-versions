His obligation was not a legal requirement but a customary practice to maintain peace during the volatile time of Passover. This reflects the tension between Roman authority and Jewish customs.<p><b>to release to the people</b><br>The practice of releasing a prisoner was a gesture to appease the Jewish populace during Passover, a major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' liberation from Egyptian slavery. This act was meant to symbolize mercy and goodwill, aligning with the themes of liberation and redemption celebrated during the feast.<p><b>one prisoner</b><br>The choice of releasing a prisoner highlights the stark contrast between Jesus, who was innocent, and Barabbas, a known criminal. This decision underscores the miscarriage of justice and the moral blindness of the crowd, who chose Barabbas over Jesus. It also serves as a type of substitutionary atonement, where the innocent suffers in place of the guilty.<p><b>at the feast</b><br>The Passover feast was a time of heightened nationalistic fervor and religious significance for the Jewish people. The timing of Jesus' trial and crucifixion during Passover is significant, as it fulfills the typology of Jesus as the Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice brings deliverance from sin, paralleling the original Passover's deliverance from physical bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

The verse roots the narrative in historical practice, highlights human responsibility, and foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s core: the innocent Lamb substituted for the guilty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">For of necessity he must release one unto them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he had a necessity.</span> The better MSS. are singularly divided as to this verse. Most omit it altogether. One, followed by some of the versions, has it after <a href="/luke/23-19.htm" title="(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)">Luke 23:19</a>. It would seem probable from these facts that the narrative was originally written without it, that it was then felt that the release of Barabbas required an explanation, and that a note was first added in the margin, either by a transcriber or by the writer himself in a duplicate copy, and then found its way into the text. The precise form of the phrase, to "have a necessity," is not found in the other Gospels, but is common to St. Luke (<a href="/luke/11-18.htm" title="If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.">Luke 11:18</a> and here), and St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-37.htm" title="Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.">1Corinthians 7:37</a>). It is found also in <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; Jude <a href="/luke/23-3.htm" title="And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say it.">Luke 23:3</a>. On the practice thus described, see Note on <a href="/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.">Matthew 27:15</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - (<span class="cmt_word">For of necessity he must release one unto them at</span> <span class="cmt_word">the feast.</span>) Probably, however, before the scourging was inflicted, the attempt to liberate Jesus in accordance with a custom belonging to that feast was made by Pilate. We know it failed, and a condemned robber called Barabbas was preferred by the people. The more ancient authorities omit this verse (17). It probably was introduced at an early period into many manuscripts of St. Luke as a marginal. gloss, as an explanatory statement based on the words of <a href="/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a> or of <a href="/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6</a>. As a Hebrew custom, it is never mentioned save in this place. Such a release was a common incident of a Latin Lectisternium, or feast in honour of the gods. The Greeks had a similar custom at the Thesmophoria. It was probably introduced at Jerusalem by the Roman power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A weak adversative particle, generally placed second in its clause;
