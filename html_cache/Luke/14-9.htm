The host, typically a person of influence, had the authority to arrange seating according to social hierarchy. This phrase highlights the host's role in maintaining order and honor at the event. Biblically, the host can be seen as a representation of God, who ultimately decides the positions of honor in His kingdom. This aligns with the biblical theme of God exalting the humble and humbling the proud, as seen in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Give this man your seat.&#8217;</b><br>This command underscores the reversal of expectations, a common theme in Jesus' teachings. The act of giving up one's seat symbolizes the relinquishing of self-assumed honor. In the broader biblical narrative, it reflects the principle that true honor comes from God, not self-promotion. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6-7</a>, which advises against seeking places of honor, and is echoed in Jesus' teachings on humility and servanthood, such as in <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>.<p><b>And in humiliation, you will have to take the last place.</b><br>The concept of humiliation here is tied to the social shame of being publicly demoted. In the honor-shame culture of the time, such an event would be deeply embarrassing. This phrase serves as a warning against pride and self-exaltation. Theologically, it illustrates the kingdom principle that the last shall be first, and the first shall be last, as stated in <a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>. It also points to the humility of Christ, who took the lowest place by becoming a servant, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>.

Three explanations may be given of what is a very real difficulty--(1) That all precepts bearing directly upon social ethics start naturally, as in the Book of Proverbs (from which the form of the teaching is, indeed, directly derived, comp. <a href="/context/proverbs/25-6.htm" title="Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:">Proverbs 25:6-7</a>), from the prudential rather than the spiritual view of life. (2) That there is in this counsel an adaptation of teaching that, left to itself, would have been higher, to the weaknesses of those who listened; a method, that as we have noted elsewhere, can hardly be defined in strictly accurate language, but, in its merely human aspects, might be regarded as involving some tinge of grave and solemn irony. From their own point of view even, they were grasping at the shadow and losing the substance, poor as that substance was. Their restless vanity was suicidal. (3) There is the deep ethical truth that every victory obtained, even under the influence of a lower motive, over a dominant weakness or strong temptation, strengthens the habit of self-control, and that the power thus developed tends in the nature of things to go on to further and yet further victories.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
