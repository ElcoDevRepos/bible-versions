The context is important as it follows the encounter with Zacchaeus, where Jesus declared His mission to seek and save the lost. The audience's attention was captured, setting the stage for a teaching moment.<p><b>Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable</b><br>Parables were a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through simple stories. They often contained deeper meanings that required reflection and spiritual insight to understand. This method engaged listeners and prompted them to think critically about the message.<p><b>because He was near Jerusalem</b><br>Geographically, Jesus was approaching Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple. This journey was significant as it foreshadowed His impending crucifixion and resurrection. Jerusalem held messianic expectations, and Jesus' approach heightened anticipation among His followers.<p><b>and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently</b><br>The Jewish people of the time were expecting a messianic kingdom that would liberate them from Roman rule and restore Israel's national glory. This expectation was rooted in Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. However, Jesus' kingdom was not of this world, and His mission was spiritual rather than political. This misunderstanding among the people set the context for the parable, as Jesus sought to correct their misconceptions about the nature and timing of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who is teaching His disciples and followers through parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>Those who were listening to Jesus, including His close disciples and others who followed Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was heading, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teaching, referring to God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable.htm">The Parable</a></b><br>A teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through accounts and analogies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_kingdom.htm">Understanding the Kingdom</a></b><br>Jesus' followers expected an immediate political kingdom, but Jesus taught that the kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_in_god's_timing.htm">Patience in God's Timing</a></b><br>Believers are called to trust in God's timing and not to rush His plans, understanding that His ways are higher than ours.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_waiting.htm">Active Waiting</a></b><br>While waiting for the kingdom's full realization, Christians are to be active in their faith, living out kingdom values and sharing the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_readiness.htm">Spiritual Readiness</a></b><br>The expectation of the kingdom should lead to spiritual vigilance and readiness, as Jesus often emphasized the need to be prepared.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>The parable that follows in <a href="/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12-27</a> highlights the importance of being faithful stewards of what God has entrusted to us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_19_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 19:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_11_s_impact_on_God_s_kingdom.htm">How does Luke 19:11 challenge our understanding of the kingdom of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Misconceptions_Jesus_addresses_in_Luke_19_11.htm">What misconceptions about the kingdom does Jesus address in Luke 19:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Living_daily_for_God_s_kingdom.htm">How can we apply the anticipation of God's kingdom in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_19_11_to_God_s_kingdom_teachings.htm">How does Luke 19:11 connect with other teachings on the kingdom of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Actions_for_when_God_s_kingdom_nears.htm">What actions should we take while "the kingdom of God is near"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_19_11_Jesus_view_on_God_s_Kingdom.htm">What does Luke 19:11 reveal about Jesus' understanding of the Kingdom of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_19_11_challenge_timing.htm">How does the parable in Luke 19:11 challenge our expectations of God's timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_use_parables_in_Luke_19_11.htm">Why did Jesus use parables like in Luke 19:11 to convey His message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bible's_middle_verse.htm">Why did Jesus weep?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_luke_19_28-40's_entry_timing_compare.htm">How does the timing of Jesus&#8217;s entry in Luke 19:28-40 align or conflict with other Gospel accounts of the Triumphal Entry?

The verse reminds us to hear carefully, steward faithfully, and hold kingdom expectations that match Scripture&#8217;s already-and-not-yet timetable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">He added and spake a parable.</span>--As in <a href="/luke/18-1.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;">Luke 18:1</a>; <a href="/luke/18-9.htm" title="And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:">Luke 18:9</a>, so here, it is characteristic of St. Luke that he states, more fully than is common in the other Gospels, the occasion and the purpose of the parable which follows. The verse throws light upon all the history that follows. In all previous visits to Jerusalem our Lord had gone up either alone or accompanied only by His chosen disciples. Now He was followed by a crowd,, gathering strength as they journeyed on, and roused, by their very nearness to the Holy City, to an almost uncontrollable excitement. The time for delay, they thought, had come to an end. He was about to claim the throne of His father David. The Kingdom of God would "immediately appear." The parable shows us, and was, in part, meant to teach them, how the Master regarded the dreams of the disciples.<p><span class= "bld">Should immediately appear.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">should be shown forth,</span> or <span class= "ital">manifested.</span> The Greek word is not used by any other New Testament writer. It is clear, from the tenor of the parable, that disciples and multitude were alike dwelling on the greatness to which they were to attain, on the high places in store for them on the right hand and on the left, rather than on their work and their duties in relation to that Kingdom of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">parable of the pounds.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they heard these things, he</span> <span class="cmt_word">added and spake a parable.</span> The words which introduce this parable-story indicate its close connection with the events which had just taken place. "He added, and spake (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</span> Thus were briefly stated the reasons which determined the Master to speak the following parable. First, "he was nigh to Jerusalem," only at most a few hours' journey from the holy city - his last solemn, awful visit, when the mysterious act of stupendous love would be accomplished. So he determined to give a veiled parabolic picture of himself and of his chosen people. Second, "they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear." In his parable he proposed to moderate the wild romantic enthusiasm of his immediate followers and of the Passover crowds by painting for them a quiet picture of the future of work and waiting which lay before them. The parable contains three sets of lessons. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The varieties of reward apportioned to different degrees of zeal and industry in the Master's service. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The eternity of loss and shame which will be the portion of the slothful and unfaithful servant. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The terrible doom of his enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the people]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
