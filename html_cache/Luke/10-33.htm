Samaritans were descendants of Israelites who had intermarried with foreigners after the Assyrian conquest, leading to religious and ethnic tensions. This context highlights the radical nature of the Samaritan's actions, as Jews typically avoided interactions with Samaritans (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). The phrase "on a journey" suggests that the Samaritan was not in his own territory, emphasizing his willingness to help despite potential risks or inconvenience.<p><b>came upon him</b><br>The Samaritan's encounter with the injured man was not planned, indicating a divine appointment. This reflects the biblical theme of God's providence and the call to love one's neighbor regardless of circumstances. The Samaritan's willingness to stop contrasts with the priest and Levite who passed by earlier (<a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31-32</a>), illustrating the call to active compassion.<p><b>and when he saw him</b><br>The act of seeing is crucial in biblical narratives, often leading to a response. In this context, it signifies awareness and acknowledgment of the man's plight. This mirrors God's attentiveness to human suffering (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>) and calls believers to be observant and responsive to the needs around them.<p><b>he had compassion</b><br>Compassion is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus, reflecting God's own nature (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). The Greek word used here, "splagchnizomai," implies a deep, visceral empathy. This compassion is not merely emotional but leads to action, embodying the love described in 1 <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>. The Samaritan's response prefigures Christ's own ministry, where He often acted out of compassion (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).

There is something noticeable in the change of word. It was not likely that the hated alien should be coming down from Jerusalem. His journey would probably be to, or from, Bethel and Gerizim. He was not, as the others were, near a home to which they might have taken the wounded sufferer. Here there is a true human feeling in one who outwardly was involved in heresy and schism, and our Lord singles that out as infinitely preferable to the form of godliness without its power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him</span>.
