The act of untying the colt fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem "righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." The colt, an unbroken young donkey, symbolizes peace, contrasting with a horse, which often symbolizes war. This act signifies Jesus' role as the Prince of Peace. The location is near Bethphage and Bethany, close to the Mount of Olives, a significant site in Jesus' ministry and eschatological events (<a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>).<p><b>its owners asked</b><br>The owners' inquiry highlights the communal nature of property and the close-knit society of first-century Palestine. It was common for animals to be shared or borrowed, especially for significant events. The owners' willingness to let the colt go upon hearing it was for the Lord (as mentioned in the surrounding verses) suggests a recognition of Jesus' authority or a divine prompting. This reflects the cultural and religious expectation of hospitality and obedience to God's purposes.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you untying the colt?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores the importance of the colt and the unusual nature of the disciples' actions. In a historical context, animals were valuable assets, and untying one without permission could be seen as theft. The question also sets the stage for the disciples to explain their actions, which they do by stating, "The Lord needs it" (<a href="/luke/19-34.htm">Luke 19:34</a>). This response indicates Jesus' foreknowledge and divine authority, as the owners allow the colt to be taken without further protest. The act of untying and taking the colt can be seen as a type of Jesus' redemptive work, where He "unties" or liberates humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who is about to enter Jerusalem in fulfillment of prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are tasked with fetching the colt for His entry into Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owners_of_the_colt.htm">The Owners of the Colt</a></b><br>Individuals who question the disciples about untying the colt, demonstrating a moment of potential conflict or misunderstanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colt.htm">The Colt</a></b><br>A young donkey that Jesus rides into Jerusalem, symbolizing peace and fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus is heading, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the place of His impending crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>The disciples demonstrate obedience by following Jesus' instructions without question.

That simple answer persuades them, displaying Christ&#8217;s kingly claim over His creation (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment illustrates how God moves hearts to cooperate with His redemptive plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35&#8211;36</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples learn that when Jesus sends them, He also prepares the responses they will face (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the verse reminds that ordinary resources&#8212;our possessions, time, talents&#8212;become instruments of worship when yielded to the Lord (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/19-33.htm">Luke 19:33</a> shows simple obedience intersecting with divine authority.
