The gospel often causes a separation between those who accept it and those who reject it. This division is not just external but can penetrate the closest of relationships, such as family. The concept of division is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>, where Jesus states He did not come to bring peace but a sword. This division is a fulfillment of prophecy and a reflection of the spiritual battle between light and darkness.<p><b>father against son and son against father</b><br>The father-son relationship is traditionally one of authority and inheritance. In the cultural context of the time, a son was expected to follow in the religious and social footsteps of his father. However, the gospel challenges these expectations, as seen in the story of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the younger son breaks away from his father's ways. This division signifies a break from traditional values and a new allegiance to Christ, which can cause familial strife.<p><b>mother against daughter and daughter against mother</b><br>The mother-daughter relationship is often characterized by nurturing and guidance. In the historical context, women were expected to maintain the household and uphold family traditions. The gospel's call to follow Christ above all else can disrupt these roles, as seen in the story of Mary and Martha (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>), where Mary chooses to listen to Jesus rather than fulfill traditional duties. This division underscores the personal cost of discipleship and the priority of spiritual over familial ties.<p><b>mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law</b><br>The relationship between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law can be complex, often involving issues of loyalty and family dynamics. In ancient times, a daughter-in-law was expected to integrate into her husband's family, adopting their customs and beliefs. The gospel's transformative power can challenge these expectations, leading to conflict. This division is reminiscent of the story of Ruth and Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-18</a>), where Ruth's loyalty to Naomi and her God signifies a break from her own cultural and familial background. This phrase emphasizes the radical nature of the gospel, which can transcend and disrupt traditional family structures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_son.htm">Father and Son</a></b><br>Represents the closest familial bond, often seen as a symbol of generational continuity and legacy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother_and_daughter.htm">Mother and Daughter</a></b><br>Another intimate family relationship, highlighting the nurturing and guiding role of a mother.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother-in-law_and_daughter-in-law.htm">Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law</a></b><br>A relationship that can be complex due to differing family traditions and expectations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_ministry.htm">Jesus' Ministry</a></b><br>The context of this teaching is during Jesus' ministry, where He often spoke about the cost of discipleship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/division.htm">Division</a></b><br>The event or outcome described is a division within families, a metaphor for the broader societal impact of following Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to division even in the most intimate relationships.
