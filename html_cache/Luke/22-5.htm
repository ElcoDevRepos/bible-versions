Their delight indicates the depth of their animosity towards Him. In the context of the Gospels, these religious leaders felt threatened by Jesus' growing influence and His challenges to their authority. Their delight also reveals their moral corruption, as they found joy in the prospect of betraying an innocent man. This reaction fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where the rulers conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>and agreed to give him money.</b><br>The agreement to give money to Judas Iscariot highlights the transactional nature of his betrayal. This act is reminiscent of <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where thirty pieces of silver are mentioned, a prophecy that finds fulfillment in the betrayal of Jesus. The amount, though not specified in this verse, is later revealed to be thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>), underscoring the contempt with which Jesus was regarded by His betrayers. This transaction also reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where monetary exchanges were common in agreements and betrayals. Judas' willingness to betray Jesus for money contrasts sharply with the teachings of Jesus on the dangers of greed and the love of money (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who were plotting to kill Jesus.

Rather than rejoicing in the arrival of their promised Messiah, they rejoice in an opportunity to silence Him&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> and foreshadowing <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-28</a>, where believers recall how &#8220;the kings of the earth took their stand&#8221; against the Lord and His Anointed.<p>&#8226; This delight also highlights the contrast Luke has been building: crowds gladly hear Jesus (<a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47-48</a>), while leaders gladly conspire to kill Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and agreed</b><p>&#8226; Agreement comes quickly; Luke presents it as unanimous. What fear (<a href="/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>) had kept them from arresting Jesus during the crowded daytime, Judas&#8217; inside information now resolves (<a href="/john/11-57.htm">John 11:57</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unified consent fulfills the pattern of opposition Jesus foretold: &#8220;The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that wicked alliances can form smoothly when truth and righteousness are absent&#8212;just as Herod and Pilate &#8220;became friends&#8221; during Jesus&#8217; trial (<a href="/luke/23-12.htm">Luke 23:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to give him money</b><p>&#8226; Matthew specifies the amount: &#8220;thirty pieces of silver&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>), the very sum Zechariah received before throwing it to the potter (<a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>), a prophecy Peter later applies to Judas (<a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Money exposes motives. Judas, already characterized as a thief who pilfered from the money bag (<a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-6</a>), now sells the Savior of the world. In doing so he illustrates <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>: &#8220;For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The leaders&#8217; willingness to fund betrayal underscores how far they will go to eliminate Jesus. Ironically, they assign the price of an injured slave (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>) to the One whose death will purchase eternal redemption (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-5.htm">Luke 22:5</a> reveals more than a transaction; it peels back the curtain on human hearts. Religious leaders delight in evil, reach swift consensus, and part with money&#8212;showing that when God&#8217;s truth is rejected, pleasure, unity, and resources quickly align against Him. Yet even this dark conspiracy unfolds within God&#8217;s sovereign plan, moving steadily toward the cross where Jesus will willingly lay down His life for sinners.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They were delighted</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#967;&#940;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echar&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5463.htm">Strong's 5463: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to be 'cheer'ful, i.e. Calmly happy or well-off; impersonally, especially as salutation, be well.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">agreed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(synethento)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4934.htm">Strong's 4934: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mid. and pass: To make a compact (agreement) with (together), covenant with, agree. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to give</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dounai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
