In the cultural context of ancient Israel, widows often faced significant challenges, including financial hardship and social vulnerability. However, Anna's life demonstrates a deep commitment to God despite these potential difficulties. Her age, eighty-four, signifies a life of perseverance and faithfulness. The number eighty-four can also be seen as symbolic, representing a complete and fulfilled life dedicated to God's service. This dedication is reminiscent of other biblical figures who served God into their old age, such as Moses and Simeon.<p><b>She never left the temple,</b><br>Anna's constant presence in the temple underscores her devotion and the centrality of worship in her life. The temple in Jerusalem was the heart of Jewish religious life, serving as the place where God's presence dwelt among His people. Her continual presence there suggests a life wholly given to God, much like the Levites who served in the temple. This phrase also indicates her role as a spiritual intercessor and a witness to the coming of the Messiah. Her dedication is a model of unwavering faith and commitment to God's work.<p><b>but worshiped night and day,</b><br>Anna's worship "night and day" emphasizes her relentless devotion and the intensity of her spiritual life. This phrase echoes the biblical call to "pray without ceasing" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>) and reflects a life centered around communion with God. Her worship was not limited to specific times or rituals but was a continuous offering of her life to God. This dedication is reminiscent of the psalmists who speak of meditating on God's law day and night (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). Anna's life of worship serves as an example of total dedication to God, transcending the boundaries of time and circumstance.<p><b>fasting and praying.</b><br>Fasting and praying were common practices in Jewish religious life, often associated with seeking God's guidance, repentance, and intercession. Anna's commitment to these disciplines highlights her deep spiritual life and her role as a prophetess. Fasting, in particular, is a sign of humility and dependence on God, often accompanying prayer to intensify its earnestness. Her life of fasting and prayer aligns with other biblical figures who sought God's presence and intervention, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>) and Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). Anna's spiritual practices underscore her role as a devout servant of God, preparing her to recognize and proclaim the arrival of Jesus, the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/anna.htm">Anna</a></b><br>A prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher.

Like the &#8220;true widow&#8230; who continues night and day in petitions and prayers&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>), she embodies dependence on God rather than on earthly security.<p>&#8226; Eighty-four years old signals advanced age, yet <a href="/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a> promises that the righteous &#8220;will still bear fruit in old age.&#8221; Anna&#8217;s life proves the point: decades of quiet service become a platform for a moment of Spirit-led proclamation (<a href="/luke/2-38.htm">Luke 2:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Her story encourages perseverance; God notices unseen years of faithfulness and weaves them into His redemptive plan (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She never left the temple</b><p>&#8220;She never left the temple&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>b)<p>&#8226; This phrase highlights wholehearted commitment.

Anna&#8217;s discipline keeps her spiritual senses sharp, preparing her to recognize Jesus.<p>&#8226; Prayer aligns her heart with God&#8217;s purposes. Her petitions rise like those of Simeon, who was &#8220;waiting for the consolation of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Together, fasting and prayer form a rhythm of dependence, reminding us that spiritual power flows from humility (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Anna&#8217;s brief cameo in Luke reveals decades of quiet, consistent faith. Widowed early, she chooses God&#8217;s house as home, fills her days and nights with worship, and disciplines herself through fasting and prayer. Her steadfast devotion positions her to greet the Redeemer and share the good news with others (<a href="/luke/2-38.htm">Luke 2:38</a>). In her, we see that no season of life is wasted when devoted to God; persistence in worship, irrespective of circumstance, places us where His promises unfold before our eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">A widow of about fourscore and four years.</span>--The better MSS. read, "<span class= "ital">up to the point </span>of fourscore and four years," pointing to the fact that this was the duration of her widowhood. Assuming her to have been married at fifteen, this places her actual age at 106. She had lived through the whole century that preceded the birth of Christ, from the death of John Hyrcanus, and had witnessed, therefore, the conquest of Judaea by Pompeius, and the rise of the Herodian house.<p><span class= "bld">Which departed not from the temple.</span>--Probably some chamber within the precincts was assigned to her, as a reputed prophetess, as seems to have been the case with Huldah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>). Her form, bent and worn, we may believe, with age and fastings, had become familiar to all worshippers at the Temple. She, too, was one of the devout circle who cherished expectations of the coming of the Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day</span>.

This seems to have been the case with Huldah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It has also been suggested that she lovingly performed some work in or about the sacred building. Farrar suggests such as trimming the lamps (as is the rabbinic notion about Deborah), derived from the word lapidoth, splendor. Such sacred functions were regarded among all nations as a high honor.
