It highlights the importance of His words spoken from the cross, emphasizing His role as a teacher and intercessor even in His suffering. The timing of this statement is crucial, as it occurs amidst the physical and emotional agony of crucifixion, showcasing His divine nature and love.<p><b>&#8220;Father, forgive them,</b><br>Here, Jesus addresses God as "Father," reflecting His intimate relationship with God and His role as the Son. The plea for forgiveness is central to the Christian message of grace and redemption. This request for forgiveness is directed towards those responsible for His crucifixion, including Roman soldiers and Jewish leaders, demonstrating the boundless nature of divine mercy. It echoes the teachings of Jesus on loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) and sets a profound example of forgiveness.<p><b>for they do not know what they are doing.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase suggests a lack of understanding on the part of those crucifying Jesus. It implies that their actions, while grievous, are done in ignorance of the full spiritual implications. This reflects a theme found in the Old Testament, where unintentional sins are treated differently from willful disobedience (<a href="/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>). It also connects to the concept of spiritual blindness, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where the "god of this age" has blinded the minds of unbelievers.<p><b>And they divided up His garments</b><br>This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>, which states, "They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." The division of Jesus' garments by the soldiers is a common practice in Roman crucifixions, where the executioners would claim the victim's possessions. This detail underscores the fulfillment of Scripture and the humiliation Jesus endured.<p><b>by casting lots.</b><br>Casting lots was a method used in ancient times to make decisions or distribute possessions, similar to drawing straws or rolling dice. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the selection of Matthias as an apostle (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). The casting of lots for Jesus' garments highlights the callousness of the soldiers and the fulfillment of prophecy, reinforcing the sovereignty of God even in the midst of human actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being crucified at this moment.

The verse calls believers to trust the accuracy of Scripture, to rest in Christ&#8217;s ongoing intercession, and to practice the same radical forgiveness He embodied on the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span>--Again, the silence is broken, not by the cry of anguish or sigh of passionate complaint, but by words of tenderest pity and intercession. It is well, however, that we should remember who were the primary direct objects of that prayer. Not Pilate, for he knew that he had condemned the innocent; not the chief priests and scribes, for their sin, too, was against light and knowledge. Those for whom our Lord then prayed were clearly the soldiers who nailed Him to the cross, to whom the work was but that which they were, as they deemed, bound to do as part of their duty. It is, however, legitimate to think of His intercession as including, in its ultimate extension, all who in any measure sin against God as not knowing what they do, who speak or act against the Son of Man without being guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost. (See Note on <a href="/acts/3-17.htm" title="And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.">Acts 3:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> These words are missing in some of the oldest authorities. They are found, however, in the majority of the most ancient manuscripts and in the most trustworthy of the old versions, and are undoubtedly genuine. These <span class="accented">first</span> of the seven words from the cross seem, from their position in the record, to have been spoken very early in the awful scene, probably while the nails were being driven into the hands and feet. Different from other holy dying men, <span class="accented">he</span> had no need to say, "Forgive <span class="accented">me</span>." Then, as always, thinking of others, he utters this prayer, uttering it, too, as Stier well observes, with the same consciousness which had been formerly expressed, "Father, I know that thou hearest <span class="accented">me</span> always." "His intercession has this for its ground, though in meekness it is not expressed: 'Father, I will that thou forgive them." In the same sublime consciousness <span class="accented">who he was</span>, he speaks shortly after to the penitent thief hanging by his side. These words of the crucified Jesus were heard by the poor sufferer close to him; they - with other things he had noticed in the One crucified in the midst - moved him to that piteous prayer which was answered at once so quickly and so royally. St. Bernard comments thus on this first word from the cross: "Judaei clamant, 'Crucifige! 'Christus clamat,' Ignosce!' Magna illorum iniquitas. seal major tun, O Domine, pietas!" <span class="cmt_word">And they parted his raiment, and cast lots</span>. The rough soldiers were treating the Master as already dead, and were disposing of his raiment, of which they had stripped him before fastening him to the cross. He was hanging there naked, exposed to sun and wind. Part of this raiment was torn asunder, part they drew lots for to see who was to wear it. The garments of the crucified became the property of the soldiers who carried out the sentence. Every cross was guarded by a guard of four soldiers. The coat, for which they cast lots, was, St. John tells us, without seam. "Chrysostom," who may have written from personal knowledge, thinks that the detail is added to show "the poorness of the Lord's garments, and that in dress, as in all other things, he followed a simple fashion." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
