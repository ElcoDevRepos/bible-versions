The suffering of the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant who bears the sins of many. Jesus' suffering includes His physical pain, emotional anguish, and spiritual burden as He takes on the sins of humanity. This suffering is not only a fulfillment of prophecy but also a demonstration of His obedience to the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where Jesus humbles Himself and becomes obedient to death on a cross.<p><b>and be rejected by this generation.</b><br>The rejection by "this generation" refers to the contemporary Jewish leaders and people who did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. This rejection fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, where the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone. The cultural and historical context of first-century Judea shows a people under Roman occupation, longing for a political Messiah who would liberate them. Jesus, however, came as a spiritual Savior, which led to misunderstanding and rejection. This rejection is a pivotal moment in salvation history, as it leads to the crucifixion, which is central to the Christian faith. The rejection also serves as a warning and a call to faith for future generations, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and accepting Jesus as Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, who is speaking about His own future suffering and rejection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/this_generation.htm">This Generation</a></b><br>Refers to the people living during Jesus' earthly ministry, particularly those who would reject Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/suffering.htm">Suffering</a></b><br>The events leading up to and including Jesus' crucifixion, where He would endure physical and emotional pain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejection.htm">Rejection</a></b><br>The act of being dismissed or refused, which Jesus experienced from the religious leaders and many of the people of His time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The ultimate place of Jesus' suffering and rejection, symbolizing His sacrifice for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' suffering and rejection were necessary parts of His mission to redeem humanity.
