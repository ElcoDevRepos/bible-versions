Parables were used to convey deep spiritual truths through simple, relatable stories. The use of "I will show you" indicates that Jesus is about to provide a vivid example to clarify His teaching. This approach is consistent with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where practical examples are used to impart wisdom (e.g., Proverbs).<p><b>who comes to Me</b><br>Coming to Jesus implies a deliberate action of seeking Him out, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. This phrase suggests a personal relationship and a willingness to follow Him. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, rabbis had disciples who would come to them for teaching. Jesus, as the ultimate Rabbi, invites people to come to Him, echoing His call in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, "Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."<p><b>and hears My words</b><br>Hearing in the biblical sense often implies more than just auditory reception; it involves understanding and internalizing the message. In the Jewish tradition, hearing is closely linked to obedience, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which begins with "Hear, O Israel." Jesus emphasizes the importance of not just hearing but truly listening to His teachings, which are the words of life (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68</a>).<p><b>and acts on them</b><br>This phrase underscores the necessity of obedience and action in response to Jesus' teachings. It reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The call to act on Jesus' words is a call to live out one's faith through deeds, aligning with the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus outlines the characteristics of His followers. This action-oriented faith is a hallmark of true discipleship, as seen in the lives of the apostles and early Christians.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd about the importance of not just hearing His words but acting on them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, they are learners and followers of Christ, seeking to understand and live out His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A larger group of people who gathered to hear Jesus' teachings, representing a diverse audience with varying levels of commitment and understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_builder.htm">The House Builder</a></b><br>Although not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the subsequent verses describe a person building a house, symbolizing those who act on Jesus' words.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation.htm">The Foundation</a></b><br>Represents the solid base of obedience and action upon which a life of faith is built.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hearing_and_doing.htm">Hearing and Doing</a></b><br>True discipleship involves both listening to Jesus' words and putting them into practice.

Here again the all but verbal reproduction of the parable shows the impression which its repetition had left on the minds of men. The variations, however, are not without significance. St. Luke alone reports that the wise man "digged deep" (better, <span class= "ital">digged, and made it deep</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and so brings out the toil and labour which attends the laying the foundation. It is not a passing emotion of assurance, a momentary act of faith, but involves a process that goes deep through the surface strata of the life, till it finds a foundation in a purified and strengthened will, or, <span class= "ital">to</span> anticipate St. Paul's teaching, in the "new man" within us, which is one with the presence of Christ as "the hope of glory" (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 47-49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like: he is like a man which built a house, and digged</span> <span class="cmt_word">deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</span> "The surrounding scenery may, in this as in other instances, have suggested the illustration. As in all hilly countries, the streams of Galilee rush down the torrent-beds during the winter and early spring, sweep all before them, overflow their banks, and leave beds of alluvial deposit on either side. When summer comes their waters fail (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>; <a href="/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>), and what had seemed a goodly river is then a tract covered with <span class="accented">debris</span> of stones and sand. A stranger coming to build might be attracted by the ready-prepared level surface of the sand. It would be easier to build there instead of working upon the hard and rugged rock. But the people of the land would know and mock the folly of such a builder, and he would pass (our Lord's words may possibly refer to something that had actually occurred) into a byword of reproach. On such a house the winter torrent had swept down in its fury, and the storms had raged, and then the fair fabric, on which time and money had been expended, had given way and fallen into a heap of ruins" (Dean Plumptre). Augustine has some weighty and practical comments on this simile of the Master's, with which, as a picture of what they had no doubt seen with their own eyes, the listening multitude would be singularly impressed. The great Latin Father calls special attention to the fact that in this picture of our Lord's the declared rejecters of the truth do not appear mirrored. In <span class="accented">both</span> the cases here instanced there is a readiness to <span class="accented">hear</span> the truth. Both the men of the parable-story built their house, but in one case the building ends in terrible disaster. "Would it have been better," asks Augustine ('Serm.' 179. 9), "not to have built at all if the building is thus to perish?" He answers, "Scarcely so; that were not to hear at all - to have built nothing. The fate of such will be to be swept away naked, exposed to wind and rain and torrents. The doom is similar in both cases; the lesson of the Lord is one easy to grasp. The wise man will hear, and, when he hears, will do, that is, will translate his impressions into actions. This will be to build a house upon a rock" (see Archbishop Trench, 'Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount,' drawn from Augustine on <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>). There is something very striking in the words with which our Master concluded his great sermon, "and the ruin of that house was great." "After all," men would say, "it was only the destruction of <span class="accented">one</span> human being." But our Lord's saying reminds us that in his eyes the ruin of <span class="accented">one</span> immortal soul is a thought full of unspeakable sorrow. "Jesus, in closing his discourse, leaves his hearers under the impression of this solemn thought. Each of them, while listening to this last word, might think that he heard the crash of the falling edifice, and say within himself, 'This disaster will be mine, if I prove hypocritical or inconsistent'" (Godet). In ver. 48 some, though not all, of the ancient authorities, instead of the words, "for it was founded upon a rock," read, "because it had been well built." This text is adopted in the Revised Version, the old reading, as less probably correct, being relegated to the margin. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I will show</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(hypodeix&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5263.htm">Strong's 5263: </a> </span><span class="str2">To indicate, intimate, suggest, show, prove.
