The offer of authority over the kingdoms and their glory reflects Satan's attempt to entice Jesus with power and dominion, which are significant themes throughout the Bible. The kingdoms represent earthly powers and political entities, which are often seen as temporary and inferior to the eternal kingdom of God. The glory of these kingdoms can be understood as their wealth, splendor, and influence. This temptation echoes the human desire for power and control, contrasting with Jesus' mission of humility and service. Theologically, this moment highlights the spiritual battle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness.<p><b>he said.</b><br>The speaker here is Satan, who is often referred to as the adversary or accuser in Scripture. His role in this passage is to test Jesus' obedience and faithfulness to God. This encounter is reminiscent of the testing of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where Satan also used deception and temptation. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan underscores the reality of spiritual warfare and the need for discernment and reliance on God's Word.<p><b>For it has been relinquished to me,</b><br>Satan claims that authority over the kingdoms has been given to him. This statement reflects the biblical understanding that, due to humanity's fall into sin, the world is under the influence of evil. Passages such as <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a> refer to Satan as the "god of this age," indicating his temporary dominion over earthly matters. However, this authority is limited and ultimately subject to God's sovereign control. The relinquishment of authority can be seen as a result of human sinfulness and the consequences of the fall.<p><b>and I can give it to anyone I wish.</b><br>Satan's claim to distribute authority suggests a level of autonomy in his operations, yet it is important to recognize that his power is not absolute. Throughout Scripture, it is clear that God remains the ultimate authority, and any power Satan possesses is permitted by God for a time. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the deceptive nature of Satan, who often promises what he cannot truly deliver. The temptation to seek power apart from God's will is a recurring theme in the Bible, warning believers to trust in God's provision and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by the devil in the wilderness after fasting for forty days.
