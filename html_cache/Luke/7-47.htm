In the context of <a href="/luke/7.htm">Luke 7</a>, Jesus is addressing Simon the Pharisee after a sinful woman anoints His feet. The use of "therefore" connects Jesus' statement to the parable of the two debtors He just shared, emphasizing the principle of forgiveness and love.<p><b>her many sins have been forgiven</b><br>This acknowledges the woman's past, recognizing her numerous sins. The phrase highlights the transformative power of forgiveness. In Jewish culture, forgiveness was often associated with temple sacrifices, but Jesus offers forgiveness directly, showcasing His divine authority. This act of forgiveness is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing the iniquities of many.<p><b>for she has loved much</b><br>Her actions demonstrate her love and gratitude. In the cultural context, anointing Jesus' feet with expensive perfume was a profound act of devotion and humility. This love is not the cause of her forgiveness but the evidence of it. Her love is a response to the grace she has received, aligning with 1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>, "We love because He first loved us."<p><b>But he who has been forgiven little loves little.</b><br>This contrasts the woman's response with that of Simon the Pharisee. It suggests that an awareness of one's need for forgiveness correlates with the capacity to love. Simon's lack of love and hospitality towards Jesus reflects his self-righteousness and failure to recognize his own need for forgiveness. This principle is echoed in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector in <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>, where humility and recognition of one's sinfulness lead to justification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about forgiveness and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinful_woman.htm">The Sinful Woman</a></b><br>A woman known for her sinful life, she demonstrates deep love and repentance by anointing Jesus' feet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_pharisee.htm">Simon the Pharisee</a></b><br>A Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house, he is skeptical of the woman's actions and Jesus' response.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_simon.htm">The House of Simon</a></b><br>The setting for this event, where Jesus is dining with Simon and others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing.htm">The Anointing</a></b><br>The act of the woman anointing Jesus' feet with perfume, symbolizing her repentance and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_forgiveness.htm">The Depth of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Understanding the magnitude of our forgiveness should lead to a profound love for Christ.

The more clearly we see our sin and the Savior&#8217;s mercy, the deeper our love will burn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">Her sins, which are many, are forgiven.</span>--Grammatically, the words admit of two interpretations, equally tenable. (1) Love may be represented as the ground of forgiveness, existing prior to it, and accepted as that which made forgiveness possible; or (2) it may be thought of as the natural consequence of the sense of being forgiven, and its manifestations as being therefore an evidence of a real and completed forgiveness. The whole drift of the previous parable is in favour of the latter explanation. The antecedent conditions of forgiveness, repentance, and faith--faith in Christ where He has been manifested to the soul as such; faith in Him as the Light that lighteth every man where He has not so been manifested--must be pre-supposed in her case as in others. And the faith was pre-eminently one that "worked by love," from the first moment of its nascent life. In such cases we may, if need be, distinguish for the sake of accuracy of thought, and say that it is faith and not love that justifies, but it is an evil thing to distinguish in order to divide.<p>Note in detail (1) that the tense used is the perfect, "Her sins . . . <span class= "ital">have been</span> forgiven her;" (2) that the many sins of her past life are not, as we should say. ignored, but are admitted, as far as the judgment of the Pharisee was concerned, and pressed home upon her own conscience; (3) the thought subtly implied in the concluding words, not that the sins of the Pharisee were few, but that he thought them few, and that therefore the scantiness of his love was a witness that he had but an equally scant consciousness of forgiveness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven</span>. Again, as in the synagogue, and no doubt on many other occasions, when these words were uttered, a thrill would run through the company present. Who was this, then, one would ask the other, who with this voice and mien dared to utter such things? Only <span class="accented">One</span> could forgive sins! Was, then, the Nazareth Rabbi, the great Physician, the Worker of awful miracles - was he the One whose Name was lost, but the echo of whose voice still lingered, they hoped, in that desecrated Holy Land? <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">she loved much</span>. Are we, then, to understand by this that her love for Jesus was the cause of forgiveness? Many Roman and some Protestant expositors have believed this is the meaning of the Lord's words. But at once a contradiction is given to this interpretation by a reference to ver. 42, where, after the remission of the two debts - the great and the little - Jesus asks, "Which of these will love him most?" But had love been the cause of a forgiveness of either or both of the debts, the question should have run, "Which of the two loved him most?" not "will love him most." In addition to which the Master guards against any view of this kind being entertained, by his concluding words (ver. 50), "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." The principle on which forgiveness was granted to the woman was <span class="accented">faith</span>, not <span class="accented">love.</span> Stier, in his comment here, writes that the expression of the Lord, "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much," is an <span class="accented">argumentum</span>, <span class="accented">non a causa</span>, <span class="accented">sed ab effectu</span> ; in other words, "I say unto thee, Her <span class="accented">many</span> sins are forgiven, <span class="accented">and thou must infer from this</span> that she loved much, or, she loves much, for (that is, <span class="accented">because</span>) her sins are forgiven." Stier gives another example of the meaning of "for" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) in this place: "The sun is risen [it must have risen], for it is day" (Stier, 'Words of the Lord Jesus:' <a href="/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>). Some may ask - What great amount of sin is necessary in order to <span class="accented">loving much</span>? Godet well answers, "We need add nothing to what each of us already has, for the sum of the whole matter is - to the noblest and purest of us, what is wanting in order to love much, is not <span class="accented">sin</span>, but the <span class="accented">knowledge of it. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little</span>. This saying refers to Simon the Pharisee; the first saying (in the former part of the verse) which we have been considering refers to the woman. The same principle exactly is presented as in the first instance, and viewed from the other side - <span class="accented">the less forgiveness</span>, <span class="accented">the less love results.</span> Our Lord is very tender in all this to Simon and men like Simon. This Pharisee had evidently tried to live up to his light, though his life was disfigured with censoriousness, narrowness, harshness, and pride - the many faults of his class. He too had heard Jesus, and had been moved and struck by his words, and, after a fashion, loved him; only the world <span class="accented">- his world -</span> came between him and his love, so that it was only a poor, pale reflection of the real feeling after all. But our Lord gives him full credit for that little love. He even excuses its poverty by saying that he, Simon, had only received a little forgiveness, and there fore only a little love was the result. Though the Lord implies in his sad irony that the <span class="accented">little</span> forgiveness which he had received was Simon's own fault, for he did not think, in his self-righteousness, that he had any need to be forgiven. "O Pharisaee, parum diligis, quia parum tibi dimitti suspicaris; non quia parum dimittitur, sed quia parum putas quod dimittitur" (St. Augustine, 'Serm.' 99.). Godet has a deep reflection on this state of Simon's. He asks, "May forgiveness be only partial? Then there would be men half-saved, half-lost The real forgiveness of the least sin certainly contains in germ a complete salvation, but only in germ. If faith is maintained and grows, this forgiveness will gradually extend to all the sins of a man's life, just as they will then become more thoroughly known and acknowledged. The first forgiveness is the pledge of all the rest.
