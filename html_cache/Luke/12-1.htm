The term "many thousands" suggests a significant gathering, reflecting Jesus' growing popularity and the intense interest in His teachings. The crowd's size and behavior, "trampling one another," highlight the urgency and desperation of the people to hear Jesus, possibly due to His reputation for performing miracles and speaking with authority. This chaotic scene underscores the contrast between the physical crowd and the spiritual message Jesus is about to deliver. The setting also reflects the socio-political climate of the time, where the Jewish people were under Roman occupation and were seeking hope and deliverance.<p><b>Jesus began to speak first to His disciples:</b><br>Jesus prioritizes His disciples, indicating the importance of preparing them for their future roles as leaders and teachers. This moment emphasizes the need for the disciples to understand and internalize His teachings before they can effectively share them with others. The focus on the disciples also suggests a distinction between the committed followers of Jesus and the curious crowd. This approach is consistent with Jesus' method of teaching, where He often explained deeper truths to His disciples privately, as seen in other passages like <a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</b><br>Leaven, or yeast, is used metaphorically here to represent the pervasive and corrupting influence of the Pharisees' hypocrisy. In biblical times, leaven was often associated with sin and impurity, as seen in the Passover tradition where unleavened bread is used to symbolize purity and separation from sin (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>). The Pharisees were religious leaders known for their strict adherence to the law, but Jesus criticizes them for their outward show of piety that lacks genuine righteousness. This warning serves as a call for the disciples to be vigilant against adopting similar attitudes and behaviors. The concept of hypocrisy is further explored in <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, where Jesus pronounces woes on the Pharisees for their double standards and lack of true spiritual integrity. This teaching also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on inner transformation over external compliance, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples amidst a large crowd.

The dispute that had begun in the Pharisee's house, and had been carried on by the lawyers and scribes as they followed Jesus from it, attracted notice. As on the occasion of the "unwashed hands" (<a href="/matthew/15-10.htm" title="And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:">Matthew 15:10</a>), He appeals from the scribes to the people, or rather to His own disciples, scattered among the people. The scene may be compared, in the vividness of its description, with the picture of the crowd at Capernaum (<a href="/context/mark/2-1.htm" title="And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.">Mark 2:1-2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees.</span>--This again was obviously an expression that had become almost proverbial in our Lord's lips (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a>). Here, however, the leaven is more definitely specified as "hypocrisy"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> unreality, the simulation, conscious or unconscious, of a holiness which we do not possess. It does not follow that the Pharisees were deliberate impostors of the Tartuffe type. With them, as with other forms of religionism, it was doubtless true that the worst hypocrisy was that which did not know itself to be hypocritical. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-59.</span> - <span class="accented">The Lord</span>, <span class="accented">after leaving the Pharisee's house</span>, <span class="accented">speaks at great length to a numerous crowd waiting for him</span>, <span class="accented">addressing his words principally to his own disciples.</span> The foregoing scene (ch. 11.), when the Master addressed his bitter reproaches to the learned and cultivated of the great Pharisee party, took place in a private house belonging to an apparently wealthy member of this, the dominant class. The name of the large village or provincial town where all this happened is unknown. The crowd who had been listening to the great Teacher before he accepted the Pharisee's invitation still lingered around the house. Many from the adjoining villages, hearing that Jesus was in this place and was publicly teaching, had arrived; so, when the Lord came out from the guest-chamber into the street or market-place, he found a vast crowd - literally, myriads of the multitude - waiting for him. The words descriptive of the crowd in ver. I indicate that a vast concourse was gathered together. His fame then was very great, though his popularity was on the wane. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy</span>. In dwelling on this and similar expressions used by our Lord in respect to the life and work of this famous section of the people who were generally so bitterly hostile to him and his teaching, we must not condemn their whole character with a condemnation more sweeping than the Master's. Utterly mistaken in their views of life and in their estimate of God, whom they professed to know, our Lord here scarcely charges them with dell-berate hypocrisy. These mistaken men dreamed that they possessed a holiness which was never theirs; unconscious hypocrites they doubtless were, without possibly even suspecting it themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
