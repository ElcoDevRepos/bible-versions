In the context of first-century Judea, a Jewish teacher like Jesus associating with a Roman centurion's request was significant, as Jews typically avoided close interactions with Gentiles. This act foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Peter and Cornelius.<p><b>But when He was not far from the house,</b><br>The proximity to the centurion's house indicates the urgency and sincerity of the centurion's request. It also sets the stage for the centurion's demonstration of faith, which is central to this narrative. The physical closeness of Jesus to the house symbolizes the spiritual closeness He offers to those who seek Him.<p><b>the centurion sent friends with the message:</b><br>The centurion's use of intermediaries reflects his understanding of Jewish customs, as entering a Gentile's home could render a Jew ceremonially unclean. This action shows his respect for Jesus and the Jewish faith. It also illustrates the centurion's humility and recognition of Jesus' authority, which is a key theme in this passage.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, do not trouble Yourself,</b><br>Addressing Jesus as "Lord" signifies the centurion's recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. This title is significant, as it was uncommon for a Roman officer to use such a term for a Jewish teacher. The phrase "do not trouble Yourself" reflects the centurion's understanding of Jesus' power and his belief that Jesus' mere word is sufficient for healing.<p><b>for I am not worthy to have You come under my roof.</b><br>This statement reveals the centurion's humility and awareness of his own unworthiness, a stark contrast to the typical Roman attitude of superiority. It echoes the biblical theme of humility before God, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."
