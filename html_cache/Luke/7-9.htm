The centurion had expressed his unworthiness for Jesus to enter his home and his belief that Jesus could heal his servant with just a word. This demonstrates the centurion's understanding of authority and power, which is significant given his Roman military background.<p><b>He marveled at the centurion</b><br>Jesus' marveling is noteworthy as it is one of the few instances in the Gospels where Jesus is described as being amazed. This reaction highlights the extraordinary nature of the centurion's faith, especially considering he was a Gentile. The centurion's faith contrasts with the often lackluster faith of many Israelites, including the religious leaders of the time.<p><b>Turning to the crowd following Him</b><br>Jesus addresses the crowd, which likely included both His disciples and other followers, as well as onlookers. This public declaration serves to emphasize the lesson He is about to impart. The crowd's presence underscores the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry and the importance of witness and testimony in His teachings.<p><b>He said, &#8220;I tell you</b><br>This introduction signals the importance and authority of Jesus' forthcoming statement. It is a common phrase used by Jesus to preface significant teachings or revelations, underscoring His role as a teacher and prophet.<p><b>not even in Israel have I found such great faith.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a profound commendation of the centurion's faith, especially given that Israel was the chosen nation, expected to be the epitome of faith in God. The centurion's faith is presented as a model, challenging the Jewish audience to reflect on their own faith. This also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament. The centurion's faith is reminiscent of the faith of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, who believed God's promises without needing physical evidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion.htm">The Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer commanding a hundred soldiers, who demonstrates remarkable faith in Jesus' authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people following Jesus, witnessing His teachings and miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles and taught in the synagogues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>The centurion's valued servant who is ill and in need of healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_borders.htm">Faith Beyond Borders</a></b><br>The centurion's faith exemplifies that true belief in Jesus transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries.
