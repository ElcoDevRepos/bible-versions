It underscores the role of Jesus as a teacher and the disciples as His students, emphasizing the personal nature of His instruction.<p><b>&#8220;The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you,</b><br>The "mysteries of the kingdom of God" refers to divine truths that were previously hidden but are now revealed through Jesus. This knowledge is a gift, indicating that understanding spiritual truths is not achieved through human effort but through divine revelation. The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. This phrase connects to passages like <a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>, where the mysteries of God are revealed to those who are spiritually receptive.<p><b>but to others I speak in parables,</b><br>Parables are simple stories used to illustrate moral or spiritual lessons. Jesus used parables to convey deep truths in a way that required reflection and spiritual insight to understand. This method of teaching fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, which speaks of people hearing but not understanding. Parables served both to reveal and conceal truth, depending on the listener's openness to God's message.<p><b>so that, &#8216;though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual blindness and deafness of those who are not receptive to Jesus' message.

This concept is echoed in <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a> and <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26-27</a>, where spiritual perception is linked to the condition of the heart.

In St. Matthew we have the Lord's reply given at greater length; the same prophecy of Isaiah which here forms the basis of St. Luke's account of Jesus' reply is given in full. St. Mark weaves the Isaiah-words into the Master's answer. The thought, however, in each of the three accounts is exactly the same. The parable mode of teaching was adopted by Jesus who, as Heart-reader, was aware now by sad experience and still sadder foreknowledge, that his glorious news rather repelled than attracted the ordinary hearer. They did not <span class="accented">want</span> to be disturbed from their earthly hopes and loves and fears. They preferred <span class="accented">not</span> to be healed as God would heal them. The Master then spoke his parables with the intention of veiling his Divine story from the careless and indifferent. These, he knew, would for the most part be repelled by such teaching, while it would specially attract the earnest inquirer. "The veil which it (the parable) throws over the truth becomes transparent to the attentive mind, while it remains impenetrable to the careless" (Godet). It was therefore his deliberate wish that such hearers might neither see nor understand. Dr. Morrison ('Commentary on St. Mark') well and clearly puts the Lord's thought here: "It is the sinner's <span class="accented">deeply rooted wish</span> that he should not see and understand, and the sad explanation of this wish is given by St. Mark - the sinner is afraid lest he should be prevailed to turn. <span class="accented">Lest at any time they should be converted</span> (<a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
