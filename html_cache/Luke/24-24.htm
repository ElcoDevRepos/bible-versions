In the Gospel of John, Peter and John are specifically mentioned as the ones who ran to the tomb (<a href="/john/20-3.htm">John 20:3-4</a>). This reflects the urgency and importance of confirming the resurrection, a pivotal event in Christian faith. The tomb, likely a rock-cut tomb typical of the period, was located outside Jerusalem, aligning with Jewish burial customs.<p><b>and found it just as the women had described.</b><br>The women, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, were the first to discover the empty tomb (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10</a>). Their testimony, though initially met with skepticism due to cultural biases against women's testimonies, was crucial. The empty tomb is a central piece of evidence for the resurrection, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy about His rising on the third day (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>).<p><b>But Him they did not see.</b><br>This highlights the initial confusion and lack of understanding among the disciples regarding the resurrection. Despite the empty tomb, Jesus' body was not there, which was perplexing to them. This absence underscores the miraculous nature of the resurrection, as Jesus later appears to His disciples in various forms, emphasizing His victory over death. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/companions.htm">Companions</a></b><br>Refers to the disciples or followers of Jesus who went to verify the women's report about the empty tomb.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The burial place of Jesus, which was found empty, signifying His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>The women who first discovered the empty tomb and reported it to the disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the passage, whose resurrection is being confirmed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>The village where the two disciples were traveling when they encountered the risen Jesus, providing context for this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witnesses.htm">The Importance of Witnesses</a></b><br>The role of the women and the disciples as witnesses to the resurrection highlights the importance of testimony in the Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_verification.htm">Faith and Verification</a></b><br>The disciples' journey to the tomb to verify the women's report teaches us about the balance between faith and seeking evidence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The empty tomb is a foundational proof of Jesus' victory over death, encouraging believers to trust in the promise of eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_doubt_and_belief.htm">The Role of Doubt and Belief</a></b><br>The initial doubt of the disciples can be a comfort to those who struggle with faith, showing that even the closest followers of Jesus needed reassurance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Power of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian doctrine, empowering believers to live transformed lives in the light of Christ's victory.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_24_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_24_24_Eyewitness_reliability.htm">How does Luke 24:24 affirm the reliability of eyewitness testimony in Scripture?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_do_disciples_experiences_explain_resurrection.htm">What role do the disciples' experiences play in understanding Jesus' resurrection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Use_disciples_methods_in_faith_journey.htm">How can we apply the disciples' investigative approach to our faith journey?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Luke_24_24_and_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">How does Luke 24:24 connect with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_verify_and_strengthen_faith.htm">What steps can we take to verify and strengthen our faith like the disciples?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_24_24_Evidence_for_resurrection.htm">How does Luke 24:24 support the resurrection's historical credibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_doubt_women_s_testimony_in_Luke_24_24.htm">Why did the disciples doubt the women's testimony in Luke 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Archaeological_proof_for_Luke_24_24_events.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Luke 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/where_was_the_stone_at_the_tomb.htm">Where was the stone when the women arrived at the tomb?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/were_women_told_about_jesus'_body.htm">Were the women informed about Jesus' body's fate?

Yet their very running affirms that the women&#8217;s testimony was already being treated seriously, overturning cultural norms that often dismissed female witnesses (compare <a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1-10</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment also fulfills <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, where David prophesied, &#8220;You will not abandon My soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay&#8221;. The empty tomb marks the turning point from prophecy to observable history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and found it just as the women had described</b><p>&#8226; Consistency of testimony strengthens credibility. The men saw the rolled-away stone, the discarded grave-cloths, and the absence of Jesus&#8212;exactly what Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others had reported (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1-3</a>, <a href="/mark/16-6.htm">Mark 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By confirming the women&#8217;s words, God underscores that He speaks through all His people, not just socially prominent voices. <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> echoes this: &#8220;I will pour out My Spirit on all people&#8230;even on My servants, both men and women.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The precise agreement between independent witnesses reinforces the literal truthfulness of the resurrection narrative. If the tomb were not empty, every claim of resurrection would collapse (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Him they did not see.</b><p>&#8226; An empty tomb alone does not equal faith; what matters is meeting the risen Lord. <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15-18</a> shows that Mary met Him only moments after finding the tomb empty, while the disciples in <a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36-43</a> saw Him that same evening. God controls the timing of revelation.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; temporary concealment presses these disciples&#8212;and us&#8212;to move from mere evidence-gathering to trusting the promises spoken beforehand (<a href="/luke/24-6.htm">Luke 24:6-8</a>). As <a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a> reminds believers, &#8220;Though you have not seen Him, you love Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The absence of Jesus&#8217; body, coupled with reliable witness, becomes a powerful apologetic: no body was ever produced because He was alive (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>). The phrase points forward to the appearances that will soon erase every doubt, culminating in Thomas&#8217;s confession, &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-24.htm">Luke 24:24</a> records an honest, step-by-step investigation: eyewitnesses hurry to the tomb, verify the women&#8217;s account, yet still lack a personal encounter with the risen Christ. The verse highlights (1) the harmony of multiple testimonies, (2) God&#8217;s validation of every faithful witness, and (3) the necessity of meeting Jesus Himself for faith to mature. The empty tomb is historical fact; the living Savior is everlasting reality.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And certain of them which were with us.</span>--The words have the interest of presenting an obviously undesigned coincidence with St. John's report of the visit of Peter and John (<a href="/john/20-3.htm" title="Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.">John 20:3</a>).
