For example, the Israelites wandered in the desert for forty years (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>), and Moses spent forty days on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). This period of temptation in the wilderness serves as a parallel to Israel's own testing and failure, highlighting Jesus as the true and faithful Israelite. The wilderness itself is a place of desolation and danger, symbolizing spiritual barrenness and the need for reliance on God. The devil, or Satan, is depicted as the adversary, whose role is to challenge and attempt to derail God's redemptive plan. This encounter emphasizes Jesus' role as the second Adam, who succeeds where the first Adam failed (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-19</a>).<p><b>He ate nothing during those days,</b><br>Fasting is a spiritual discipline seen throughout Scripture, often associated with seeking God's guidance, repentance, or preparation for a significant task. Jesus' fasting for forty days mirrors Moses' fast on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>) and Elijah's journey to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), both of which were times of divine encounter and revelation. This act of fasting underscores Jesus' dependence on the Father and His commitment to His mission. It also highlights His humanity, as He experiences physical hunger and weakness, yet remains spiritually strong.<p><b>and when they had ended, He was hungry.</b><br>This statement affirms the true humanity of Jesus, who experienced physical needs and limitations. His hunger after the fast emphasizes the reality of His incarnation, as He fully participates in the human condition (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). This moment of vulnerability sets the stage for the devil's temptations, which aim to exploit Jesus' physical weakness. However, it also demonstrates Jesus' perfect obedience and reliance on God's provision, contrasting with Israel's complaints and lack of faith during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). Jesus' victory over temptation foreshadows His ultimate triumph over sin and death, affirming His identity as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted.

Moses fasted &#8220;forty days and forty nights&#8221; on Sinai while receiving the Law (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>), Elijah journeyed &#8220;forty days and forty nights&#8221; to Horeb before hearing God&#8217;s whisper (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and Israel wandered forty years before entering the land (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; In every case, God uses forty to shape servants for future ministry. Jesus stands in that same pattern, yet He surpasses it&#8212;He is the true and better Israel, the perfect Law-giver, the greater Prophet.<p>&#8226; The stretch of forty days reminds us that the Father&#8217;s timing is purposeful; seasons of testing are neither random nor wasted (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was tempted by the devil</b><p>&#8226; Luke leaves no doubt that a personal, malicious tempter confronted Jesus. Satan&#8217;s reality is affirmed throughout Scripture: &#8220;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The confrontation is not symbolic; it is a real clash between the sinless Son (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) and the rebel who sought to corrupt Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) and accuse Job (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus endures every enticement without yielding, proving Himself the spotless Lamb who will &#8220;destroy the works of the devil&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Christ faced Satan head-on, believers now resist a defeated foe &#8220;standing firm in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He ate nothing during those days</b><p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s brief note highlights a total fast.

This heightens the contrast between fleshly appetite and spiritual obedience.<p>&#8226; The fast underscores voluntary weakness: Jesus chooses hunger to magnify reliance on the Father, modeling the truth that &#8220;man shall not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-4.htm">Luke 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; While the duration is supernatural, the principle is accessible: intentional self-denial cultivates listening hearts (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when they had ended, He was hungry</b><p>&#8226; These simple words affirm the full humanity of Christ.

Satan attacks precisely where human vulnerability seems greatest, yet Jesus anchors Himself in Scripture rather than appetite.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-2.htm">Luke 4:2</a> paints a concise yet profound portrait of the Savior&#8217;s preparation: forty deliberate days, real demonic opposition, complete fasting, and genuine human hunger. Each phrase reveals the Messiah who stands where Israel stumbled, who resists where Adam fell, and who triumphs so His people can follow in victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being forty days tempted of the devil.</span> For some reason unknown to us, the number forty seems to possess some mystic significance. Moses was forty days alone with the Divine Presence on Horeb. Elijah fasted forty days in the wilderness before the vision and the voice came to him. Forty years was the period, too, of the wanderings of the chosen people. The existence of an evil power has been a favorite subject of discussion in those schools of thought who more or less question the authoritative teaching of the canonical books of the two Testaments. Keim, quoted by Godet, well and fairly sums up the present state of opinion of the more moderate and thoughtful schools of free-thought: "We regard the question of an existence of an evil power as altogether an open question for science." Those, however, who recognize the Gospel narratives as the faithful expression of Jesus Christ's teaching, must accept the repeated declarations of the Master that an evil being of superhuman power does exist, and has a great, though a limited, influence over the thoughts and works of men. Whatever men may feel with regard to the famous clause in the Lord's Prayer, which the Revisers of the Authorized Version render, "deliver us from the evil one," they must agree at least with the conclusion of the Revisers, that, in the Christian Church, a large majority of the ancients understood the Master's words in his great prayer as asking deliverance, not from "evil" in the abstract, as the English Authorized Version seems to prefer, but deliverance from the power of some mighty evil being<span class="cmt_word">. And in those days he did eat nothing</span>. In this state of ecstasy, when the body was completely subordinate to the Spirit, the ordinary bodily wants seem to have been suspended. There is no difficulty in accepting this supposition, if the signification of the words, "in the Spirit," above suggested, be adopted. The whole transaction belongs to the miraculous. We, who receive as God's Word these Gospel narratives, find no difficulty in recognizing God's power to suspend, when he pleases, what men regard as fixed natural laws. We believe, too, that on certain occasions in the world's history it has pleased him to put this power into operation. He afterward hungered. Although still in the Spirit, in order to provide a field for the exercise of the peculiar typical temptation about to be dwelt upon, some of the bodily functions, which during the trance or the ecstasy had been temporarily suspended, were allowed again to play their usual part in the life, as in the ease Of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul, and John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[where for] forty</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tesserakonta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5062.htm">Strong's 5062: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty.
