It emphasizes the gravity of the moment and the need for the disciples to be aware of what is about to unfold.<p><b>The hand of My betrayer</b><br>The phrase indicates a close relationship, as sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and trust in ancient cultures. The betrayal by Judas Iscariot fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. This act of betrayal is pivotal in the Passion narrative, leading to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion.<p><b>is with Mine</b><br>This highlights the intimate setting of the Last Supper, where Jesus and His disciples are gathered. The shared meal underscores the treachery of Judas's actions, as he is part of the inner circle. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' foreknowledge and the divine plan, as He is aware of the betrayal yet continues to offer grace and fellowship.<p><b>on the table.</b><br>The table setting is significant, as it is the Passover meal, a time of remembrance and covenant renewal for the Jewish people. This setting connects to the broader biblical theme of covenant, with Jesus instituting the New Covenant through His impending sacrifice.

St. Luke's account is here the briefest, St. John's by far the fullest. There is again a slight discrepancy in the order of facts, St. Luke placing the mention of the Betrayal after, St. Matthew and St. Mark before, the institution of the memorial. St. John, who makes no mention of the institution, leaves the question open. On the whole, the order of the first two Gospels seems here the most probable. and agrees better with the fourth. The <span class= "ital">date</span> before us do not enable us to say with certainty whether Judas partook of the memorial; but, if we follow the first two Gospels, it would seem probable that he did not. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord's sorrowful allusion to Judas the traitor.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with</span> <span class="cmt_word">me on the table.</span> This is the second mention of the traitor in St. Luke's account of the Last Supper. From St. John's recital, we gather that Jesus returned several times in the course of that solemn evening to this sad topic. That one of his own little inner circle, so closely associated with him, should so basely betray him, was evidently a very bitter drop in the Lord's cup of suffering. In his dread experience of human sorrow it was needful that the Christ should fulfill in his own experience what even the noblest of the children of men - David, for instance - had felt of the falseness of friends. What suffering can be inflicted on a generous heart comparable to it? Surely he of whom it was written, "Whose sorrows are like unto my sorrows?" must make trial of <span class="accented">this</span> bitterness. Chrysostom thinks that the Master, in some of these repeated allusions during the "Supper," tried to win Judas over to a better mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Look!</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
