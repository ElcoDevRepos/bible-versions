This context highlights the confusion and disbelief among the disciples, as they struggled to comprehend the reality of Jesus' resurrection. The sharing of these events underscores the importance of testimony and witness in the early Christian community, as they sought to understand and spread the news of Jesus' victory over death.<p><b>Jesus Himself stood among them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical presence of Jesus, affirming the bodily resurrection. It counters any notion that Jesus was merely a spirit or vision. The sudden appearance of Jesus among the disciples, despite locked doors (as noted in <a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>), demonstrates His divine nature and the transformed state of His resurrected body. This moment fulfills Jesus' promise that He would rise again and be with His followers (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;</b><br>"Peace be with you" is a traditional Jewish greeting, "Shalom," which carries deep significance. It conveys not only a wish for tranquility but also a blessing of wholeness and well-being. In the context of Jesus' resurrection, this greeting takes on a profound meaning, as Jesus offers peace that comes from reconciliation with God through His sacrifice. This peace fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace."

The mode of appearance in both Gospels suggests the idea, as in <a href="/luke/24-31.htm" title="And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.">Luke 24:31</a>, of new conditions of existence, exempted from the physical limitations of the natural body, and shadowing forth the "spiritual body" of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

St. John records (<a href="/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>) the same salutation at the same interview. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-49.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord appears to the apostles as they were gathered together on the evening of the first Easter Day.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst</span> <span class="cmt_word">of them.</span> St. John, who also gives an account of this appearance of the Risen, adds the detail, "when the doors were shut." The eleven and their friends were gathered together for counsel, probably too in hope that something more would happen after what had already taken place that Easter Day - the report of the holy women of the repeated vision of angels, their own verification of the empty sepulchre, and above all the testimony of Peter that he had seen the Lord. Into this anxious, waiting assembly the two "Emmaus" disciples enter with their wondrous story. In the act of their mentally comparing notes, <span class="accented">Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.</span> This sudden presence there is evidently supernatural. He "stood in the midst of them," though the doors were carefully closed and barred "for fear of the Jews" Rumours of the Resurrection, no doubt, had already spread through the city, and it was uncertain whether such turnouts might not be followed by the arrest of the chief followers of the Crucified. <span class="cmt_word">Peace be unto you</span>. This was the ordinary Jewish greeting, but on this occasion, spoken by the Lord, possessed more than the ordinary meaning. This "peace" was his solemn, comforting greeting to his own, just as "his peace" which he left with them on the sad Thursday eve was his solemn farewell to the eleven, spoken, perhaps, in the same "upper room "<span class="accented">just</span> before he went out to the garden of the agony. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
