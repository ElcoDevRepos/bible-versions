They were influential in Jewish society and often clashed with Jesus over interpretations of the law. The scribes were experts in the law, responsible for copying and interpreting the Scriptures. Together, they represented the religious authority of the time, often seen as protectors of Jewish purity and tradition.<p><b>complained to Jesus&#8217; disciples</b><br>The Pharisees and scribes often questioned Jesus' actions and teachings, seeking to undermine His authority. By addressing the disciples, they aimed to create doubt and division among Jesus' followers. This reflects a common tactic of challenging a leader by targeting their followers, seen throughout biblical narratives.<p><b>&#8220;Why do you eat and drink</b><br>In Jewish culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. Eating and drinking with someone implied a level of intimacy and approval. The Pharisees were concerned with ritual purity and believed that associating with certain groups could lead to defilement. This question highlights their focus on external purity rather than internal transformation.<p><b>with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</b><br>Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society for collaborating with the Roman occupiers and often extorting money. They were seen as traitors and were socially ostracized. "Sinners" referred to those who did not adhere to the Pharisaic interpretation of the law, including those with morally questionable lifestyles. Jesus' association with these groups demonstrated His mission to seek and save the lost, as seen in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>, and foreshadowed the inclusive nature of the Gospel. This interaction also prefigures the New Covenant, where salvation is offered to all, regardless of social or religious standing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The best reading and translation would give, "The Pharisees and the scribes among them" - "among them," that is, among the Capernaites; in other words, "They among them who were Pharisees and scribes." These scribes (Hebrew, <span class="accented">sopherim</span>), under this appellation, first appear after the Exile. Their occupation was to copy and to expound the Law. They were the recognized teachers of the Jews, and seem to have succeeded that great and influential class or order, the "sons of the prophets," originally founded by Samuel. These "sons of the prophets" are repeatedly mentioned in the books of the Old Testament which treat of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The scribes were succeeded, in the year , by the <span class="accented">tanaim</span> (repeaters), under which name the scribes were officially, though apparently not popularly, known until A.D. , after which date these scribes were termed <span class="accented">amoraim.</span> The Talmud (Mishna and Gemara) may be said to have been the work of this great and enduring teacher order.
