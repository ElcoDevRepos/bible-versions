In the context of the parable of the shrewd manager, it highlights the manager's cunning and resourcefulness. The manager's self-awareness and quick thinking are emphasized, which can be seen as a call for believers to be wise and discerning in their own lives. This moment of clarity is crucial, as it sets the stage for the actions that follow.<p><b>so that after my removal from management</b><br>The manager anticipates his dismissal, which reflects the precarious nature of employment and social status in the ancient world. This phrase underscores the theme of accountability and the consequences of mismanagement. It also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly positions and possessions, echoing biblical teachings on stewardship and the importance of being faithful with what one has been given (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10-12</a>).<p><b>people will welcome me into their homes.</b><br>This phrase indicates the manager's plan to secure his future by ensuring he has a place in the community after losing his job. It highlights the cultural importance of hospitality and social networks in the ancient Near East. The manager's strategy involves creating goodwill and securing relationships, which can be seen as a metaphor for the eternal relationships and treasures that believers are encouraged to cultivate (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).

The dramatic abruptness of the parable leaves us uncertain who "they" are that are to "receive" him. The context that follows immediately supplies the deficiency. What answers to this, in the interpretation, is the moment when a Church or party or an individual teacher, halts between two policies--one that of striving after righteousness, and the other of secular expediency--and makes up its mind to adopt that which promises the most immediate and most profitable results.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am resolved what to do</span>.
