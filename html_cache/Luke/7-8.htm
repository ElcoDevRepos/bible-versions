The centurion, a Roman officer, acknowledges his position within a chain of command, which is crucial in the Roman military system known for its discipline and order. This understanding of authority is significant in the context of the passage, as it parallels the authority of Jesus over sickness and spiritual forces. The centurion's recognition of authority also reflects a broader biblical theme where authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>with soldiers under me</b><br>The centurion's mention of soldiers under his command highlights his role as a leader responsible for the actions and well-being of his men. This reflects the Roman military's structure, where centurions were key figures, often commanding a century of about 80 soldiers. This military context underscores the centurion's familiarity with obedience and command, which he equates to Jesus' spiritual authority. The centurion's leadership role can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads and commands His followers.<p><b>I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he comes</b><br>This phrase illustrates the centurion's confidence in the obedience of his soldiers, which he uses as an analogy for Jesus' authority over illness. The immediate response of the soldiers to the centurion's commands is a testament to the discipline and respect within the Roman army. This obedience is mirrored in the spiritual realm, where Jesus' commands are followed by nature and spirits alike, as seen in other Gospel accounts (e.g., <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, where Jesus calms the storm).<p><b>I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.</b><br>The centurion's reference to his servant obeying his commands further emphasizes the theme of authority and obedience. In the cultural context, servants were expected to follow the orders of their masters without question. This reflects the centurion's belief in Jesus' ability to command healing from a distance, demonstrating faith in Jesus' divine authority. This faith is commended by Jesus in the following verses, highlighting the centurion's understanding of spiritual truths despite being a Gentile. This interaction foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius, another centurion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers.

He knows what it means to submit, mirroring the biblical principle that &#8220;there is no authority except from God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). By recognizing Jesus&#8217; superior, unseen authority, the centurion demonstrates the same faith that <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> describes&#8212;confidence in things not yet seen but absolutely real. His words echo the humility of John the Baptist: &#8220;He must increase; I must decrease&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With soldiers under me</b><p>While under authority, the centurion also wields real, delegated power. This parallels Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry: though the Son submits to the Father (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>), He commands demons, sickness, and nature (<a href="/luke/8-25.htm">Luke 8:25</a>). The centurion&#8217;s experience helps him grasp that delegated authority works effectively when backed by a higher throne&#8212;just as believers act in Christ&#8217;s name (<a href="/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I tell one to go, and he goes</b><p>Immediate obedience marks military life, illustrating how creation itself responds to Christ&#8217;s commands: winds and waves obey (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39&#8211;41</a>), and fevers depart (<a href="/luke/4-39.htm">Luke 4:39</a>). The centurion&#8217;s insight points to an unspoken truth: if his orders produce instant action, how much more will Christ&#8217;s word carry absolute power over illness?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And another to come, and he comes</b><p>Orders also summon rather than dismiss. Jesus similarly calls disciples&#8212;&#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>)&#8212;and they leave nets behind at once. The centurion&#8217;s analogy teaches that Christ&#8217;s call, whether to life (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43&#8211;44</a>) or to service (<a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>), evokes willing movement because His authority is complete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I tell my servant to do something, and he does it</b><p>The servant belongs fully to his master&#8217;s will, just as believers are &#8220;bought at a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). The centurion trusts Jesus to command sickness itself, treating disease like a subordinate that must obey. His confidence foreshadows the Great Commission where Jesus, possessing &#8220;all authority in heaven and on earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), sends His followers to act in His stead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/7-8.htm">Luke 7:8</a> showcases a centurion who understands and trusts authority&#8212;both received and exercised. By paralleling his military life with Jesus&#8217; spiritual sovereignty, he affirms that a single word from Christ carries irresistible power. His insight moves Jesus to marvel (<a href="/luke/7-9.htm">Luke 7:9</a>) and reveals that true faith rests on the certainty that Scripture&#8217;s Lord commands every realm, and all must obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and he doeth</span> it. What the soldier really thought of Jesus is evident when we read <span class="accented">between the lines</span> of this saying of his: "If I, who am under many a superior - the chiliarch of my thousand, the tribunes of my legion, my emperor who commands at Rome - yet receive a ready and willing obedience from my soldiers, and have but to say to one, ' Go,' and he goeth, to another, 'Come,' and he cometh; how much more thou, who hast no one above thee, no superior, when <span class="accented">thou</span> commandest disease, one of thy ministers, will it not at once obey?"
