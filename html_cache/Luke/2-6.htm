According to <a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2:1-5</a>, they traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem due to a decree from Caesar Augustus for a census. Bethlehem, known as the City of David, holds significant historical and prophetic importance. It fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. This journey also highlights the humble circumstances surrounding Jesus' birth, as Bethlehem was a small and seemingly insignificant town.<p><b>the time came</b><br>This indicates the fulfillment of God's divine timing. Throughout the Bible, God's timing is perfect and often contrasts with human expectations. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a> speaks of the fullness of time when God sent His Son. This moment was not only the culmination of Mary's pregnancy but also the fulfillment of centuries of prophecy and anticipation for the Messiah. It underscores the sovereignty of God in orchestrating events according to His plan.<p><b>for her Child to be born</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the humanity and divinity of Jesus. The birth of Jesus is a pivotal event in Christian theology, marking the incarnation of God as a human being. <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> prophesied the virgin birth, and <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a> confirms its fulfillment, highlighting Jesus as "Immanuel," meaning "God with us." This birth signifies the beginning of Jesus' earthly life and mission to bring salvation to humanity.
