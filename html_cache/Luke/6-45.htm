In biblical context, the "good man" is one who aligns with God's will and reflects His righteousness. The "good treasure" refers to the virtues, wisdom, and spiritual truths stored within one's heart, cultivated through a relationship with God and adherence to His Word. <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a> advises believers to guard their hearts, as it is the wellspring of life, highlighting the importance of nurturing a heart filled with godly treasure. The imagery of treasure suggests something valuable and worth preserving, indicating that the heart's condition is crucial to one's spiritual health and moral conduct.<p><b>and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart</b><br>Here, the contrast is drawn between the good and evil man, illustrating the principle that one's actions are a reflection of their inner moral state. The "evil man" is characterized by a heart filled with negative influences, such as sin, selfish desires, and worldly values. This aligns with <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful and desperately wicked without divine intervention. The "evil treasure" signifies the accumulation of corrupt thoughts and intentions, which inevitably manifest in harmful actions. This phrase serves as a warning about the dangers of allowing one's heart to be influenced by ungodly elements, emphasizing the need for spiritual vigilance and transformation through Christ.<p><b>For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks</b><br>This statement underscores the principle that speech is a direct indicator of one's inner spiritual condition. The "overflow" suggests abundance, indicating that what fills the heart will naturally spill over into one's words. <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6-12</a> discusses the power of the tongue and its potential for both blessing and cursing, reinforcing the idea that speech reflects the heart's true nature. In a cultural context, words were seen as powerful and binding, often revealing one's character and intentions. This phrase calls believers to self-examination and encourages them to fill their hearts with God's truth, ensuring that their words edify and reflect the love and wisdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd about the nature of the heart and its influence on one's words and actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, they are being instructed on the principles of righteous living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A larger group of listeners who are also present during Jesus' teaching, representing a diverse audience with varying levels of understanding and belief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_influence.htm">The Heart's Influence</a></b><br>Our words and actions are direct reflections of our heart's condition.

There the words are spoken in immediate connection with the judgment which the Pharisees had passed on our Lord as casting out devils by Beelzebub, and follow on a reproduction of the similitude of the tree and its fruit. The sequence of thought in that passage helps us to trace a like sequence here. Out of the "good treasure of his heart" the good man would bring forth, not harsh or hasty judgment, but kindness, gentleness, compassion; out of the "evil treasure" the man who was evil, the hypocrite who judged others by himself, would bring forth bitterness, and harsh surmises, and uncharitable condemnation.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
