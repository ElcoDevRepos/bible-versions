Dining in this context refers to a formal meal, likely in the home of a Pharisee named Simon. Meals were significant social events, often involving discussions of theology and law.

The verse reminds believers that no history is beyond redemption and that genuine faith moves from hearing to humble, wholehearted action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">A woman in the city, which was a sinner.</span>--The word is clearly used as pointing to the special sin of unchastity. The woman was known in the city as plying there her sinful and hateful calling. The question who she was must be left unanswered. Two answers have, however, been given. (1) The widespread belief that she was Mary Magdalene--shown in the popular application of the term "Magdalen" to a penitent of this class--has absolutely not a single jot or tittle of evidence in Scripture. Nor can there be said to be anything like even a tradition in its favour. The earliest Fathers of the Church are silent. Origen discusses and rejects it. Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine are doubtful. It first gained general acceptance through the authority of Gregory the Great. The choice of this narrative in the Gospel for the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene stamped it as with the sanction of the Western Church. The omission of that feast from the calendar of the Prayer Book of 1552 shows that the English Reformers at least hesitated, if they did not decide against it. We may note further (<span class= "ital">a</span>) that if the popular belief were true we should have expected some hint of it on the occurrence of the name of Mary Magdalene in <a href="/luke/8-3.htm" title="And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered to him of their substance.">Luke 8:3</a>; (<span class= "ital">b</span>) that the description given of that Mary, as one out of whom had been cast "seven devils," though not incompatible with a life of impurity, does not naturally suggest it; (c) that, on the assumption of identity, it is difficult to say when the "devils" had been cast out. Was it before she came with the ointment, or when our Lord spake the words, "Thy sins are forgiven thee?" It is obvious that the conduct of the woman in the Pharisee's house was very different from the wild frenzy of a demoniac. (2) The belief adopted by some interpreters, and more or less generally received in the Church of Rome, that the woman was none other than Mary the sister of Lazarus, who, on this hypothesis, is identified also with Mary Magdalene, is even more baseless. The inference that when St. John speaks of Mary of Bethany as "that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment," must refer to the previous anointing which St. Luke narrates, and not to that which St. John himself records (<a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>), is almost fantastic in its arbitrariness; and it will seem to most minds inconceivable that such a one as the sister of Lazarus, who appears in <a href="/luke/10-42.htm" title="But one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.">Luke 10:42</a> as "having chosen the good part," could so shortly before have been leading the life of a harlot of the streets. Occurring as the narrative does in St. Luke only, it is probable enough that the "woman which was a sinner" became known to the company of devout women named in <a href="/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>, and that the Evangelist derived his knowledge of the facts from them. His reticence--possibly their reticence--as to the name was, under the circumstances, at once natural and considerate.<p><span class= "bld">When she knew that Jesus . . .</span>--The words imply that she had heard of Him--perhaps had listened to Him. She may have heard of His compassion for the widow of Nain in her sorrow. She might have been drawn by the ineffable pity and tenderness of His words and looks. She would show her reverence as she could.<p><span class= "bld">Brought an alabaster box of ointment.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>. There is not the same stress laid here, as in the anointing by Mary of Bethany, on the preciousness of the ointment; but we may believe that it was relatively as costly. Passages like <a href="/proverbs/7-17.htm" title="I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.">Proverbs 7:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24</a>, suggest the thought that then, as perhaps in all ages, the lavish and luxurious use of perfumes characterised the unhappy class to which the woman belonged. The ointment may have been purchased for far other uses than that to which it was now applied. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Pharisee's house.</span> The text in the older authorities is more forcible: "a woman which was a sinner in that city." Her miserable way of life would thus be well known to Simon and other of the guests. This sad detail would serve to bring out the contrast in more vivid colours. In these Oriental feasts the houses were often left open, and uninvited strangers frequently passed in through the open courtyard into the guest-chamber, and looked on. <span class="accented">She</span> had heard Jesus already, perhaps often, and had drunk in his pleading words, begging sinners to turn and to come to him for peace. Perhaps what had decided her to take this step of boldly seeking out the Master were words apparently spoken about this time (in St. Matthew's Gospel they follow directly after the discourse respecting the Baptist just related), "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," etc. (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). It was a bold step for one like her to press uninvited, in broad daylight, into the house of a rigid purist like Simon; but the knowledge that Jesus (though personally, as she <span class="accented">thought</span>, she was unknown to him) was there, gave her courage; she felt no one would dare to thrust her out of the presence of the strange loving Master, who so earnestly had bidden the sin-weary come to him, and he would give them rest! <span class="cmt_word">Brought an alabaster box of ointment</span>. Pliny mentions alabaster as the best material for pots or vessels intended for these precious ointments. It was softer than marble, and easily scooped into pots or bottles. These costly unguents and cosmetics were much used by the wealthy Roman ladies. The precious ointment poured over the Redeemer's feet had probably been originally procured for a very different purpose. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, translated "ointment," was used for any kind of sweet-smelling vegetable essence, especially that of the myrtle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a sinful</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#969;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hamart&#333;los)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_268.htm">Strong's 268: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sinning, sinful, depraved, detestable.
