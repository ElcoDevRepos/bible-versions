The setting is the courtyard of the high priest, where Jesus is being tried. The time reference suggests a period of waiting and tension, as Peter remains in the courtyard, likely filled with anxiety and fear. This hour is significant as it fulfills Jesus' prophecy that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crows (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>).<p><b>another man insisted</b><br>The use of "another man" highlights the repeated accusations Peter faces. This is the third and final denial, showing the increasing pressure and scrutiny Peter is under. The insistence of the man reflects the growing certainty among the bystanders that Peter is indeed associated with Jesus. This insistence can be seen as a test of Peter's faith and loyalty, which he ultimately fails in this moment.<p><b>Certainly this man was with Him</b><br>The certainty expressed by the accuser underscores the recognition of Peter as a follower of Jesus. This recognition could be due to Peter's previous public association with Jesus during His ministry. The statement also reflects the danger of being identified with Jesus at this time, as He is being tried and condemned. The certainty contrasts with Peter's denials, highlighting his fear and the weakness of his resolve.<p><b>for he too is a Galilean</b><br>Galilee was a region in northern Israel, and its inhabitants were often recognized by their distinct accent and mannerisms. The identification of Peter as a Galilean links him to Jesus, who was also from Galilee. This geographical connection is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy that Jesus would be a light to the Gentiles, beginning His ministry in Galilee (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>).

Scripture is exact: the first two denials have already happened (<a href="/luke/22-56.htm">Luke 22:56-58</a>). An hour&#8217;s delay underlines God&#8217;s patience even in Peter&#8217;s testing.<p>- Jesus had foretold, &#8220;Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>). The clock is ticking toward that divine benchmark.<p>- This calm, measured interval magnifies Peter&#8217;s responsibility; there is time to recall Jesus&#8217; warning, just as later the risen Lord will give Peter deliberate opportunities for restoration (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another man insisted</b><p>- Earlier it was a servant girl and then &#8220;another&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-56.htm">Luke 22:56-58</a>); now a third witness presses the charge.

Now the same relationship he boasted of becomes the relationship he disowns.<p>- <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> reminds disciples that belonging to Jesus brings inevitable scrutiny and opposition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he too is a Galilean</b><p>- Peter&#8217;s accent and dress betray his origin (<a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>).

Yet the Lord chose Galilee for much of His ministry&#8212;a reminder that God elevates what the world discounts.<p>- Peter will later stand boldly in Jerusalem, still a Galilean, declaring, &#8220;God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>). The very mark that now exposes his fear will soon identify him as Spirit-filled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-59.htm">Luke 22:59</a> records the climactic moment before Peter&#8217;s third denial. A full hour underscores God&#8217;s sovereign timetable; a persistent witness increases accountability; unmistakable companionship with Jesus and a Galilean identity leave Peter no plausible escape&#8212;yet he will still deny.
