This encounter takes place in Nazareth, a small town in Galilee, highlighting God's choice of humble settings and people for His divine purposes. Gabriel's previous appearance to Zechariah in the temple (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11</a>) establishes a pattern of divine intervention in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>&#8220;Greetings, you who are highly favored!</b><br>The greeting "highly favored" indicates that Mary has been chosen by God's grace for a special role in His plan. This phrase emphasizes God's initiative and grace rather than any merit on Mary's part. The Greek term "kecharitomene" suggests a state of grace bestowed by God, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>, where believers are described as being graced in the Beloved. This highlights the continuity of God's grace from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>The Lord is with you.&#8221;</b><br>This assurance of God's presence echoes similar assurances given to key figures in biblical history, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). It underscores the divine support and empowerment Mary will receive for the task ahead. The phrase also foreshadows the incarnation, where God will be with humanity in a new and profound way through Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of Immanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_gabriel.htm">Angel Gabriel</a></b><br>A messenger of God who is often associated with delivering important announcements.

Like Gideon meeting &#8220;the Angel of the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>, Mary meets a messenger who moves the story of salvation forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;Greetings,</b><p>&#8226; Gabriel&#8217;s opening word is warm and personal. Heaven is not aloof; it speaks our language.<p>&#8226; Similar peace-filled greetings mark pivotal moments: &#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; when the risen Christ meets His disciples (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The greeting assures Mary she is safe in the presence of the supernatural, setting the tone for the rest of the announcement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you who are highly favored!</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Favor&#8221; here is pure grace. Mary did not earn it; God bestowed it. Noah once &#8220;found favor in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>), and Esther won &#8220;the favor of the king&#8221; (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>). Mary steps into that same gracious pattern.<p>&#8226; The favor points to God&#8217;s initiative in salvation: &#8220;For it is by grace you have been saved through faith&#8230;not by works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Luke immediately echoes the idea in verse 30: &#8220;Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God&#8221;. The repetition underscores that grace surrounds every part of the incarnation story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lord is with you.</b><p>&#8226; The promise of God&#8217;s presence anchors Mary&#8217;s calling, just as it did for Joshua&#8212;&#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230;for the LORD your God is with you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah foretold, &#8220;The virgin will conceive and give birth to a Son, and they will call Him Immanuel&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), a name Matthew explains means &#8220;God with us&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary is literally carrying the One whose very name signals God&#8217;s nearness. The angel&#8217;s words are both comfort for her and a declaration for all humanity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a> celebrates, &#8220;The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress&#8221;. That fortress now draws near in flesh and blood through Mary&#8217;s womb.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Gabriel&#8217;s visit is a factual, divinely orchestrated moment in history. His greeting assures Mary that heaven&#8217;s plan is unfolding with grace, not merit. She is the recipient of God&#8217;s unearned favor, chosen to bear the Messiah. The climactic promise, &#8220;The Lord is with you,&#8221; ties Mary&#8217;s personal comfort to the grand theme of Scripture: God dwells with His people. <a href="/luke/1-28.htm">Luke 1:28</a>, therefore, announces God&#8217;s gracious initiative, His choice of a humble servant, and His unwavering presence&#8212;all of which culminate in the birth of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Highly favoured.</span>--The verb is the same as that which is translated, "hath made us accepted "in <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; and, on the whole, this, which is expressed in one of the marginal readings, seems the truest.
