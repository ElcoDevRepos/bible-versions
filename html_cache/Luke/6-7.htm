Their intent to find fault with Him highlights their resistance to His teachings and authority. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where religious leaders are depicted as antagonists to Jesus' ministry. Their desire to accuse Him is rooted in their fear of losing power and influence over the people. This behavior fulfills the prophecy of opposition to the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>the scribes and Pharisees</b><br>The scribes were experts in the Law of Moses, responsible for teaching and interpreting it. The Pharisees were a religious sect known for their strict adherence to the Law and oral traditions. Both groups held significant influence in Jewish society. Their collaboration in this context underscores their shared interest in maintaining religious control and their mutual opposition to Jesus, who challenged their interpretations and authority.<p><b>were watching Him closely</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate and intense scrutiny of Jesus' actions. The religious leaders were not merely observing out of curiosity but with the intent to find fault. This vigilance is indicative of their hardened hearts and unwillingness to accept Jesus' message. It also reflects the broader theme of spiritual blindness, as they fail to recognize the divine authority and compassion of Jesus.<p><b>to see if He would heal on the Sabbath</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest, as commanded in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>. Over time, numerous additional regulations were added by religious leaders, making Sabbath observance burdensome. Healing on the Sabbath was considered work, thus violating these man-made rules. Jesus' actions on the Sabbath often challenged these interpretations, emphasizing the spirit of the Law over the letter. His willingness to heal on the Sabbath demonstrates His authority over the Law and His compassion for human need, as seen in <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>, where He states, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being observed by the religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish legal experts and scholars of the Law of Moses, often seen as opponents of Jesus in the Gospels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious sect known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions, often in conflict with Jesus over interpretations of the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The seventh day of the week, a day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, central to the conflict in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/healing.htm">Healing</a></b><br>The act of Jesus performing miracles, which often led to confrontations with religious leaders over the appropriateness of such acts on the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath was intended as a day of rest and worship, not a burden.
