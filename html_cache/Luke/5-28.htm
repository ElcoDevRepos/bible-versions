His immediate response to Jesus' call demonstrates a radical transformation and willingness to leave behind his old life. This act of rising up signifies a readiness to embrace a new identity and purpose. In biblical terms, "getting up" often symbolizes resurrection or a new beginning, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>, where Jesus commands a paralytic to rise.<p><b>left everything</b><br>Levi's decision to leave everything behind is significant, as it indicates a complete break from his former life and its material attachments. Tax collectors were typically wealthy, so this act of leaving everything underscores a profound commitment and sacrifice. This mirrors the call of other disciples, such as Peter, James, and John, who left their fishing nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a>). It reflects the biblical theme of forsaking worldly possessions for the sake of the Kingdom of God, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>.<p><b>and followed Him</b><br>Following Jesus implies discipleship, which involves learning from and imitating the life and teachings of Christ. Levi's decision to follow Jesus marks the beginning of his transformation into Matthew, the apostle and Gospel writer. This act of following is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a shift in allegiance and priorities. It aligns with Jesus' call to all believers to take up their cross and follow Him (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>). Levi's transformation is a type of the greater transformation that Jesus offers to all who choose to follow Him, fulfilling prophecies of a new covenant and a renewed heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi (Matthew)</a></b><br>Levi, also known as Matthew, was a tax collector.
