His role at the crucifixion underscores the political tension between the Jewish leaders and Roman governance. The events he witnessed included the supernatural darkness (<a href="/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-45</a>) and the tearing of the temple veil, which symbolized the end of the old covenant and the opening of direct access to God through Jesus. This moment of realization for the centurion is significant, as it shows a Gentile recognizing the divine nature of Jesus, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><b>he gave glory to God</b><br>The centurion's response is one of reverence and acknowledgment of divine intervention. In a culture where Roman soldiers were often polytheistic, his act of giving glory to the God of Israel is profound. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's sovereignty being recognized by all nations (<a href="/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a>). His declaration is a testament to the power of Jesus' death to transcend cultural and religious barriers, pointing to the universal scope of the Gospel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Surely this was a righteous man.&#8221;</b><br>The centurion's statement affirms Jesus' innocence, contrasting with the accusations that led to His crucifixion. The term "righteous" indicates moral integrity and fulfillment of God's law, aligning with Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah as the Righteous One (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>). This acknowledgment by a Roman officer highlights the injustice of Jesus' death and foreshadows the recognition of His righteousness by future believers. It also connects to the theme of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice, the spotless Lamb of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>), whose righteousness is imputed to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion.htm">The Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers.

The substitution of "this was a righteous man," for "this was the Son of God," may, perhaps, have originated in a wish to express the exact measure, and not more, of the sense in which the centurion had used the seemingly higher words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous Man</span>. This was the Roman officer who was in command of the detachment on guard at the three crosses. St. Paul - who, if he did not absolutely put together the Third Gospel and the Acts, had much to do with the compilation and arrangement of these writings - on his many journeys and frequent changes of residence in different parts of the empire, had many opportunities of judging the temper and spirit of the Roman army, and on several occasions speaks favourably of these officers (<a href="/luke/7-2.htm">Luke 7:2</a>; <a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>; <a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>; <a href="/acts/22-26.htm">Acts 22:26</a>; <a href="/acts/27-43.htm">Acts 27:43</a>). <span class="accented">Certainly this was a righteous Man.</span> The noble generosity, the brave patience, and the strange majesty of the Sufferer; the awful portents which for three hours had accompanied this scene - portents which the centurion and many of the bystanders could not help associating with the crucifixion of him men called "the King of the Jews;" then the death, in which appeared no terror; - all this drew forth the exclamation of the Roman. In St. Matthew, the words of the centurion which are reported are "the Son of God." Twice in those solemn hours had the centurion heard the Crucified pray to his Father. This may have suggested the words, "Son of God;" but this change in the later Gospel of St. Luke to "a righteous Man" seems to point to the sense in which the Roman used the lofty appellation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
