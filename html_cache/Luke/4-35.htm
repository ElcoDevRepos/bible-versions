However, Jesus' authority in rebuking the demon highlights His divine power and authority over the spiritual realm, distinguishing Him from other exorcists of the time. This act fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah setting captives free. The term "rebuked" is significant, as it is often used in the Gospels to describe Jesus' authoritative command over nature and evil forces (e.g., <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Be silent!&#8221; He said.</b><br>Jesus' command for silence is a demonstration of His authority over the demon, preventing it from speaking further. This command may also reflect Jesus' desire to control the revelation of His identity and mission, as seen in other instances where He instructs demons or healed individuals not to disclose His identity (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>, <a href="/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>). This reflects the Messianic Secret, a theme in the Gospels where Jesus gradually reveals His identity and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Come out of him!&#8221;</b><br>The command for the demon to come out is direct and effective, showcasing Jesus' power to liberate individuals from demonic oppression. This act of deliverance is a sign of the in-breaking Kingdom of God, as Jesus demonstrates His authority over evil. It also prefigures the ultimate victory over Satan and evil that will be accomplished through His death and resurrection. This command is reminiscent of the authority given to the disciples in <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>, where they are empowered to cast out demons in Jesus' name.<p><b>At this, the demon threw the man down before them all</b><br>The demon's reaction of throwing the man down is a final act of defiance, yet it ultimately submits to Jesus' authority. This public display underscores the reality of spiritual warfare and the visible impact of Jesus' power over evil. The act of throwing down may also symbolize the demon's defeat and the liberation of the man, aligning with the biblical theme of God's power triumphing over chaos and disorder.<p><b>and came out without harming him.</b><br>The fact that the demon came out without harming the man is significant, as it demonstrates Jesus' compassionate authority and the completeness of His deliverance. Unlike other exorcisms of the time, which might have involved harm or prolonged struggle, Jesus' deliverance is immediate and complete. This reflects the nature of Jesus' ministry, which is characterized by healing and restoration. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's protection and care for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His authority over evil spirits.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/demon.htm">Demon</a></b><br>A malevolent spiritual being possessing a man, showcasing the reality of spiritual warfare.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/possessed_man.htm">Possessed Man</a></b><br>The individual afflicted by the demon, representing those in need of deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, a town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Witnesses to the miracle, representing the public's exposure to Jesus' divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' command over the demon illustrates His supreme authority over all spiritual realms.

This word appears earlier when He calms a storm (<a href="/luke/8-24.htm">Luke 8:24</a>), showing that the same authority that stills wind and waves silences unclean spirits. In <a href="/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25</a> Jesus issues an identical rebuke; in <a href="/matthew/17-18.htm">Matthew 17:18</a> the same authoritative command frees a tormented boy. Every instance underlines that Christ&#8217;s sovereignty over creation extends to the unseen realm. For believers, <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> reminds us that He has &#8220;disarmed the rulers and authorities,&#8221; making public spectacle of them at the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Be silent!" He said</b><p>Why gag the demon?<p>&#8226; Jesus will not let a lying spirit serve as His herald. <a href="/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11-12</a> shows Him consistently silencing demons even when they cry out the truth about His identity.<p>&#8226; He guards the timing and manner of His self-revelation (<a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The command demonstrates His power: the enemy must obey immediately (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>).<p>Paul echoes this pattern in <a href="/acts/16-17.htm">Acts 16:17-18</a> when he casts out a spirit that shouts after him; the apostle, like his Master, refuses demonic publicity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Come out of him!"</b><p>Deliverance follows silence. With a concise order Jesus frees the captive (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a> fulfilled in real time). <a href="/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a> records a similar command to the legion possessing the Gerasene. Whenever Jesus speaks, darkness yields: &#8220;If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). The exodus motif rings here&#8212;just as God brought Israel out of Egypt, Christ brings individuals out of Satan&#8217;s grip (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At this, the demon threw the man down before them all</b><p>The spirit&#8217;s last act is violent drama, echoing <a href="/mark/9-20.htm">Mark 9:20</a> where another demon convulses a boy before departing. Evil tries to intimidate on its way out, but it can only do what divine permission allows (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>). The public spectacle turns into a living sermon: everyone present sees the hopeless state of bondage&#8212;and the greater power of Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and came out without harming him</b><p>Although the throw looks dangerous, Luke notes that the man is untouched. Contrast this with the seven sons of Sceva, whom a demon beats and strips (<a href="/acts/19-16.htm">Acts 19:16</a>). Under Christ&#8217;s authority, liberation never destroys the person; it restores. <a href="/luke/9-42.htm">Luke 9:42</a> records a similar outcome: &#8220;Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and returned him to his father.&#8221; In <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19-20</a> the righteous are promised deliverance &#8220;without one bone broken,&#8221; a foreshadowing of both Christ&#8217;s own preservation on the cross (<a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>) and the complete salvation He secures for His followers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a> showcases Jesus&#8217; unrivaled authority: He confronts evil, silences deceit, commands release, and protects the liberated. The episode is more than an ancient exorcism; it is a living portrait of the gospel&#8212;Christ overpowers darkness, sets captives free, and leaves them whole.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace</span>.
