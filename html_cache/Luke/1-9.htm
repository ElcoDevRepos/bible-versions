This method ensured that the selection was impartial and divinely guided. The casting of lots is seen in other biblical instances, such as the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and the selection of Matthias as an apostle to replace Judas (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). The use of lots underscores the belief in God's sovereignty over human affairs.<p><b>according to the custom of the priesthood</b><br>The priesthood in Israel was established by God through Moses, with Aaron and his descendants serving as priests (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The duties of the priests were highly regulated, with specific customs and traditions passed down through generations. These customs included the rotation of priestly duties, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, where King David organized the priests into divisions. The custom of casting lots for temple service ensured that each priest had the opportunity to serve in the holy place, as there were many priests and limited opportunities.<p><b>to enter the temple of the Lord</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people. It was originally built by Solomon (1 Kings 6) and later rebuilt after the Babylonian exile. By the time of <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a>, Herod's Temple stood as a magnificent structure. Entering the temple was a significant honor and responsibility, as it was where God's presence dwelt. Only priests could enter the holy place, and only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and that only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).<p><b>and burn incense</b><br>Burning incense was a key part of the daily temple rituals, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The incense altar was located in the holy place, just outside the veil separating it from the Most Holy Place. The incense offering was made twice daily, in the morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). This act of worship was a reminder of the need for continual prayer and intercession before God. The burning of incense also foreshadows Christ's role as our intercessor, who continually mediates on behalf of believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, chosen to burn incense in the temple.

God used a simple drawing to place one man at the exact spot and hour He had ordained.<p>&#8226; Casting lots for ministry is seen again when the apostles chose Matthias (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). Scripture consistently presents the practice as a means God can employ to reveal His will.<p>&#8226; Priests in the days of David were already divided &#8220;impartially by drawing lots&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>).

The routine shows the order God values: &#8220;everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>, applied here by pattern).<p>&#8226; Tradition restricted a priest to offering incense only once in his lifetime, making Zechariah&#8217;s moment a singular honor and a divine appointment that would intersect with the angelic announcement to follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense</b><p>&#8226; The priest stepped into the Holy Place, just outside the veil, to burn incense on the golden altar every morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). This fragrant smoke rose heavenward, picturing prayer. &#8220;May my prayer be set before You like incense&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a> the same imagery appears as &#8220;the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God,&#8221; confirming that the ritual pointed beyond itself to continual intercession.<p>&#8226; Only priests could draw this near, foreshadowing Jesus our great High Priest who &#8220;always lives to intercede&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).

The office of burning incense gave the priest to whom this important lot fell the right of entering the holy place. It was the most coveted of all the priestly duties. The Talmud says the priest who obtained the right to perform this high duty was not permitted to draw the lot a second time in the same week, and as the whole number of priests at this time was very large - some say even as many as twenty thousand - Farrar conjectures that it would never happen to the same priest twice in his lifetime to enter that sacred spot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">he was chosen by lot,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(elache)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2975.htm">Strong's 2975: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb, which is only used as an alternate in certain tenses; to lot, i.e. Determine especially by lot.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">according to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
