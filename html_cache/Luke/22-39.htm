The Mount of Olives is a ridge east of Jerusalem, offering a panoramic view of the city. It is a place of prayer and reflection for Jesus, as seen in other Gospel accounts (<a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>, <a href="/mark/11.htm">Mark 11:1</a>). The Mount of Olives is also prophetically significant, as it is mentioned in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> as the place where the Lord will stand in the end times. This habitual visit underscores Jesus' commitment to prayer and solitude with the Father, a model for believers to seek regular communion with God.<p><b>and the disciples followed Him</b><br>The disciples' following of Jesus here is both literal and symbolic. Literally, they accompany Him to the Mount of Olives, showing their loyalty and desire to be near Him. Symbolically, this act of following represents discipleship, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. Following Jesus involves obedience, learning, and emulating His life and teachings. This moment foreshadows the challenges they will face in their commitment to Him, especially as the events of His arrest and crucifixion unfold. The disciples' presence also fulfills Jesus' earlier teachings about the cost of discipleship (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>), emphasizing the importance of steadfastness in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is preparing for His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who accompany Him to the Mount of Olives, demonstrating their commitment and desire to learn from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A significant location just outside Jerusalem, often associated with prayer and reflection, and a place where Jesus frequently went to pray.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_habit_of_prayer.htm">The Habit of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus' regular visits to the Mount of Olives highlight the importance of establishing consistent prayer habits.

St. Matthew's account is the most complete. St. Mark adds one saying of the Lord's containing a deep theological truth, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee." These remarkable words, occurring as they do in the midst of the most solemn scene of prayer in the Redeemer's earth-life, tell of the vast <span class="accented">possibilities</span> of prayer. What may not be accomplished by earnest supplication to the throne of grace? St. Luke's account is the shortest, but it contains the story of the angelic mission of help, and the additional detail of the "bloody sweat." St. John alone of the four omits the scene; but, as in other most important recitals where he refrains from repeating the story of things thoroughly known in his Master's Church at the period when he committed his Gospel to writing, he takes care, however, often to record some hitherto unrecorded piece of the Lord's teaching, which is calculated to throw new light upon the momentous twice and thrice told incident, the story of which he does not deem it necessary to repeat. So in ch. 2. he throws a flood of light upon Christian baptism. Ch. 6. is a Divine commentary on the Holy Eucharist. While in <a href="/luke/12-23.htm">Luke 12:23-28</a> he gives us, in his Master's words, a new insight into that awful sorrow which was the source of the agony in Gethsemane. Canon Westcott suggests that the succession of the main events recorded by the four evangelists was as follows: - Approximate time: 1 a.m.... <p>The agony. <p>The betrayal. <p>The conveyance to the high priest's house, probably adjoining "the Booths of Hanna." 2 a.m....  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] went out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(exelth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
