It is a place of prophecy and eschatological importance, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, where it is prophesied that the Lord will stand on the Mount of Olives at His return. This location is also where Jesus delivered the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24-25), discussing the end times. The descent from the Mount of Olives into Jerusalem is symbolic of Jesus' journey towards His crucifixion, fulfilling His role as the Messiah.<p><b>the whole multitude of disciples</b><br>This phrase indicates a large group of followers, not limited to the Twelve Apostles. It includes those who have witnessed Jesus' ministry and miracles. The term "disciples" here refers to all who have committed to following Jesus and His teachings. This multitude represents the growing recognition of Jesus as a significant figure, possibly the Messiah, by the people of Israel.<p><b>began to praise God joyfully</b><br>The act of praising God joyfully reflects the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The disciples' joy is rooted in the belief that Jesus is the promised Messiah who has come to deliver Israel. This moment is reminiscent of the joy expressed in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>, which speaks of rejoicing in the day the Lord has made. Their praise is an acknowledgment of God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His redemptive plan.<p><b>in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies the intensity and sincerity of their praise. It is a public declaration of their faith and recognition of Jesus' divine authority. This public acclamation contrasts with the often private and subdued nature of worship in the temple, highlighting the spontaneous and heartfelt nature of their response to Jesus' works.<p><b>for all the miracles they had seen</b><br>The miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and feeding the multitudes, serve as signs of His divine authority and messianic identity. These acts fulfill Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah performing miraculous deeds. The disciples' praise is a direct response to these signs, affirming their belief in Jesus as the one sent by God to bring salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, approaching Jerusalem, fulfilling His messianic role.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who witness His miracles and respond with praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>A significant location east of Jerusalem, often associated with prophetic events and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city Jesus is entering, symbolizing the culmination of His earthly ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/miracles.htm">Miracles</a></b><br>Acts performed by Jesus that demonstrate His divine authority and power, prompting the disciples' praise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_praise.htm">The Power of Praise</a></b><br>The disciples' response to Jesus' miracles was joyful praise.

At this point on the Bethany road the city of Jerusalem comes into view. Here a crowd of pilgrims to the Passover Feast, many of whom were well acquainted with Jesus, came out to meet and welcome him with their branches of palm. These joined his friends who accompanied him from Bethany. This enthusiasm was excited among the Passover pilgrims in great measure owing to the report which by this time had got abroad of the raising of Lazarus (see <a href="/john/12-17.htm">John 12:17, 18</a>). Many had already gone out from the city to Bethany to see Jesus and Lazarus. Of the Messianic shouts of welcome which sounded in the crowd, St. Luke does not mention the "Hosanna!" of St. Matthew, no doubt because this peculiar Hebrew cry would not have conveyed any meaning to the Gentile readers to whom his story was especially addressed. The two incidents which follow - the crying out of the stones, and the weeping of the Master over his beautiful doomed city (vers. 39-44) - occur only in St. Luke. His source of information here was evidently quite different to the other two synoptists or St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
