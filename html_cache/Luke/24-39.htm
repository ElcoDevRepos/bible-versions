In the cultural context of the time, physical evidence was crucial for establishing truth. The hands and feet were pierced during the crucifixion, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, "They pierced my hands and my feet." This act of showing His wounds is a direct response to the doubts of His disciples, who were struggling to comprehend the resurrection. The geographical context of Jerusalem, where the crucifixion and resurrection took place, is significant as it was the center of Jewish religious life and prophecy fulfillment.<p><b>It is I Myself.</b><br>This declaration asserts Jesus' personal identity and continuity before and after the resurrection. The phrase underscores the doctrine of the bodily resurrection, affirming that Jesus is not a different entity or a mere spirit, but the same person who lived, died, and rose again. This statement is crucial in countering early heresies that denied the physical resurrection of Jesus. Theologically, it connects to the "I AM" statements in the Gospel of John, where Jesus identifies Himself with God, reinforcing His divine nature and mission.<p><b>Touch Me and see&#8212;</b><br>Here, Jesus invites His disciples to verify His physical presence through touch, a tangible proof of His resurrection. This invitation is significant in a historical context where eyewitness testimony was paramount. The act of touching is reminiscent of Thomas' encounter with Jesus in <a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>, where Jesus invites Thomas to touch His wounds to overcome doubt. This physical interaction highlights the reality of the resurrection, distinguishing it from ghostly apparitions or spiritual visions common in ancient cultures.<p><b>for a spirit does not have flesh and bones,</b><br>This phrase distinguishes between a physical body and a spirit, emphasizing the corporeal nature of Jesus' resurrected body. In Jewish thought, spirits were considered non-corporeal, and Jesus' statement clarifies that His resurrection was not merely spiritual but involved a transformed physical body. This distinction is important for understanding the nature of the resurrection body, as discussed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>, where Paul describes the resurrection body as imperishable and glorified, yet physical.<p><b>as you see I have.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on "as you see" appeals to the disciples' sensory experience, reinforcing the reality of the resurrection through sight. This visual confirmation is crucial in a historical context where seeing was believing. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of witnessing, as the disciples are called to be witnesses of Jesus' resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This witnessing is foundational for the spread of the Gospel, as the disciples' testimony is based on their firsthand experience of the risen Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples, affirming His physical resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are gathered and initially frightened, thinking they see a spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these post-resurrection appearances occur, central to the events of Jesus' death and resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, a cornerstone of Christian faith, demonstrating victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus' invitation to touch His hands and feet underscores the physical reality of His resurrection, affirming that He is not merely a spirit but has a glorified body.

These elements affirm that the same crucified Lord now lives in glorified form, validating Scripture, securing our salvation, and guaranteeing our own future resurrection in a restored, physical creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Behold my hands and my feet.</span>--The test thus offered to the disciples, like that afterwards given to Thomas, was to be to them a proof that they were not looking on a spectre from the shadow-world of the dead. The Resurrection was a reality, not an appearance. In St. John's words, "which our hands have handled" (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>), we have an interesting coincidence with the use of the same word here. The conditions of the problem must remain, however, transcendental and mysterious. There is a real corporeity, and yet there is a manifest exemption from the common conditions of corporeal existence. St. Luke's narrative presents an undesigned coincidence with that of <a href="/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>. What Thomas asked for was the evidence which had, he heard, been given to others. Without that evidence he could not, he felt, believe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.</span> "See," he says, inviting the terror-stricken disciples to a calm, unaffrighted contemplation - "see my hands and my feet pierced with the nails which fastened them to the cross; <span class="accented">it is I myself."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have</span>. The first words quietly told the awe-struck ones to look closely at him, and to ascertain from the dread marks he bore that what they looked upon was Jesus their Master. Then he proceeded to bid them touch him, handle him, and so assure themselves that it was no phantom, no bodiless spirit, that stood before them. These words of the Lord, and the invitation, "handle me, and see," made the deepest impression on the hearers. These, then, were proofs of the Resurrection that admitted of no shadow of doubt. These words, this sight, changed their lives. What cared they afterwards for men and men's threatenings? Death, life, to them were all one. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> the Lord, they had handled with their hands "that which was flora the beginning" (see <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). Browning forcibly puts this thought which so influenced the first great teachers. The dying St. John is dwelling on the thought that when he is gone there will be none left with men who saw and <span class="accented">touched</span> the Lord. <p><span class="accented">"If I live yet, it is for good, more love<br />Through me to men: be nought but ashes here<br />That keep awhile my semblance, who was John.<br />Still, when they seater, there is left on earth</span> <p><span class="accented">No one alive who knew (consider this!),<br />Saw with his eyes, and handled with his hands,<br />That which was from the first, the Word of life.<br />How will it be when none more saith, 'I saw'?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">A Death in the Desert.'</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Look at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7988;&#948;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(idete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
