In the cultural context, Jesus' instruction aligns with the Messianic Secret, a theme in the Gospels where Jesus often tells those He heals to remain silent about their healing. This could also be seen as a test of obedience for the healed man, emphasizing the importance of following Jesus' instructions over seeking personal glory or attention.<p><b>&#8220;But go, show yourself to the priest&#8221;</b><br>This directive is rooted in the Levitical law found in <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>, which required those healed of leprosy to be examined by a priest. The priest acted as a public health official, confirming the healing and allowing the individual to reintegrate into society. This act underscores Jesus' respect for the Mosaic Law and the established religious practices of the time. It also serves as a witness to the priests, who were often skeptical of Jesus' authority and miracles.<p><b>&#8220;and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing&#8221;</b><br>The offering mentioned refers to the sacrifices outlined in <a href="/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10-32</a>, which included two birds, cedarwood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, followed by offerings of lambs and grain. This ritual was not only a religious duty but also a public declaration of the individual's restored health and purity. It highlights the continuity between Jesus' ministry and the Old Testament law, showing that Jesus did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it.<p><b>&#8220;as a testimony to them.&#8221;</b><br>The testimony serves multiple purposes. It is a personal testimony of the man's healing, a public testimony to the community of his restored status, and a spiritual testimony to the priests of Jesus' divine authority. This act could also be seen as a prophetic sign pointing to Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who cleanses from sin. The testimony challenges the religious leaders to recognize the power and authority of Jesus, potentially leading them to reconsider their understanding of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who heals the leper and gives him specific instructions following his healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leper.htm">The Leper</a></b><br>A man suffering from leprosy who approaches Jesus for healing.

We find this desire of Jesus to check publicity after he had worked one of his great works, especially in the earlier part of his ministry. Chrysostom attributes this to the Master's regard for the one who had been healed, desiring that his gratitude to God for the mercy vouchsafed to him should not be frittered away in words, in idle talk with curious persons. It is, however, more likely that the Master wished to stem rather than to fan the tide of popularity which such mighty works would be sure to excite among the people. What he determined to check was a false and mistaken desire among the people to make him king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;{Do not} tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
