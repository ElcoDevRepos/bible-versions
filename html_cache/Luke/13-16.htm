It underscores the importance of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and God's promises to His people. Jesus' use of this term indicates her rightful place in receiving God's mercy and healing. It also challenges the prevailing cultural and religious norms that often marginalized women, affirming her worth and dignity in God's eyes.<p><b>whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years</b><br>This phrase reveals the spiritual dimension of the woman's affliction, attributing her condition to Satan's influence. It reflects the biblical understanding of spiritual warfare, where Satan is often depicted as an adversary seeking to oppress God's people (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>, <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The mention of "eighteen long years" emphasizes the severity and duration of her suffering, highlighting the compassion of Jesus in addressing long-standing afflictions. It also serves as a reminder of the ultimate victory over Satan through Christ's ministry and sacrifice (1 <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).<p><b>be released from her bondage</b><br>The concept of release from bondage is central to the message of the Gospel, symbolizing spiritual liberation and freedom from sin and oppression (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>). Jesus' healing acts as a foretaste of the ultimate redemption and deliverance He offers.

Jesus' healing on the Sabbath challenges the legalistic interpretations of the religious leaders, who prioritized ritual observance over compassion and mercy (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>). This act underscores the true purpose of the Sabbath as a time for doing good and bringing life, aligning with God's character and intentions.

Because this afflicted woman is a covenant heir, and because Satan&#8217;s tyranny violates God&#8217;s purpose for His people, her release is both righteous and urgent. The passage affirms Christ&#8217;s authority over spiritual darkness and highlights the Sabbath as a day to celebrate God&#8217;s liberating grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Whom Satan hath bound.</span>--The words imply the belief that there was another source than mere bodily disease for the infirmity--in part, at least, the belief that all disease--or very many forms of it--is directly or indirectly traceable to the power of the Enemy. So St. Paul's "thorn in the flesh"--assuming it to be some sharp bodily suffering--is "the messenger of Satan." (See Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>.)<p>It is obvious that this narrative would have for one like St. Luke a special interest over and above that which like narratives had for the other Evangelists. We can scarcely fail to think of the "beloved physician" as practising his art for the good of men, his brothers, on the Sabbath, as on other days. In doing so he would doubtless be met, on the part of Jews and Judaisers, with words like those of the ruler of the synagogue, "There are six days on which men ought to work; do thy work of healing on them." For such a one it would be a comfort unspeakable to be able to point to our Lord's words and acts as sanctioning his own practice.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">should</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(edei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third person singular active present of deo; also deon deh-on'; neuter active participle of the same; both used impersonally; it is Necessary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
