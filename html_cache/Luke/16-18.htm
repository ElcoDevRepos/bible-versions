In the biblical context, marriage is a covenant relationship, reflecting the union between Christ and the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>). The cultural context of first-century Judaism allowed for divorce, but Jesus emphasizes the original intent of marriage as a lifelong commitment (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). The Mosaic Law permitted divorce (<a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>), but Jesus clarifies that this was due to the hardness of human hearts (<a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>). The act of marrying another after divorce is equated with adultery, highlighting the seriousness of breaking the marital bond. This teaching aligns with the prophetic call for faithfulness found throughout the Old Testament, where Israel's unfaithfulness to God is often depicted as spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8-9</a>).<p><b>and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery</b><br>This phrase further underscores the permanence of marriage. In the historical context, women often faced significant social and economic challenges after divorce. By stating that marrying a divorced woman results in adultery, Jesus elevates the status of marriage and protects the dignity of women, who were often marginalized. This teaching challenges the prevailing cultural norms of the time, where men could easily divorce their wives. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of covenant faithfulness, as seen in God's unwavering commitment to His people despite their unfaithfulness (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>). The emphasis on adultery serves as a warning against undermining the divine institution of marriage, which is meant to reflect God's unchanging love and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing teaching on the sanctity of marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often challenged Jesus' teachings, particularly on matters of the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The covenantal relationship between a man and a woman, which is the focus of this teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The legal dissolution of a marriage, which is addressed in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery.htm">Adultery</a></b><br>The act of being unfaithful in marriage, which is highlighted as a consequence of divorce and remarriage in this context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant established by God, intended to be lifelong and exclusive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_divorce.htm">The Seriousness of Divorce</a></b><br>Divorce is not to be taken lightly, as it disrupts the divine intention for marriage and can lead to sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adultery_and_its_consequences.htm">Adultery and Its Consequences</a></b><br>Remarriage after divorce, except in certain circumstances, is considered adultery, underscoring the gravity of marital vows.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_forgiveness_and_reconciliation.htm">The Role of Forgiveness and Reconciliation</a></b><br>While divorce is serious, there is always room for forgiveness and reconciliation through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_biblical_guidance.htm">The Importance of Biblical Guidance</a></b><br>Believers should seek wisdom from Scripture and godly counsel when facing marital challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_18_s_view_on_marriage_today.htm">How does Luke 16:18 define the sanctity of marriage in today's society?

Here, again, the explanation that has been given of the parable of the Unjust Steward, offers the only satisfactory explanation of the introduction of a topic apparently so irrelevant. The doctrine and discipline of divorce which the Pharisees taught, lowering the sacredness of the life of home, and ministering to the growing laxity of men's morals, was precisely what was meant by the steward's bidding the debtors take their bill and write fifty, or fourscore measures, instead of the hundred. (See Note on <a href="/context/luke/16-6.htm" title="And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.">Luke 16:6-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.</span> The teaching of the rabbis in the time of our Lord on the question of the marriage he was exceedingly lax, and tended to grave immorality in the family life. In the late unlawful marriage of Herod Antipas with Herodias, in which so many sacred and family ties were rudely torn asunder, no rabbi or doctor in Israel but one had raised his voice in indignant protest, and that one was the friend and connection of Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet John the Baptist. Divorce for the most trivial causes was sanctioned by the rabbis, and even such men as Hillel, the grandfather of that Gamaliel whom tradition speaks of as the rabbi whose lectures were listened to by the Boy Jesus, taught that a man might divorce his wife if in the cooking she burnt his dinner or even over salted his soup (see Talmud, treatise 'Gittin,' 9:10). SS. Luke and Paul, different to the great masters of profane history, like Thucydides, or Livy, or Xenophon, were evidently at no pains to round off their narratives. They give us the account of the Lord's words and works very much as they had them from the first listeners and eye-witnesses. When the notes and memories were very scant and fragmentary, as appear to have been the case in the Lord's discourse which St. Luke interposes between the parable of the steward and that of Dives and Lazarus, the fragmentary notes are reproduced without any attempt to round off the condensed, and at first sight apparently disconnected, utterances. So here, directly after the fragmentary report of certain sayings of Jesus, the great parable of Lazarus and Dives is introduced with somewhat startling abruptness; nothing of St. Luke's is added - simply the original report as Luke or Paul received it is reproduced. The following is probably the connection in which the famous parable was spoken. When the Lord spoke the parable-story of the unjust steward, he pressed home to the listeners, as its great lesson, the necessity of providing against the day of death, and he showed how, by the practice of kindness here towards the poor, the weak, and the suffering, they would make to themselves friends who would in their turn be of use to them - who would, in their hour of sore need, when death swept them out of this life, receive them into everlasting habitations. We believe that the Master, as he spoke these things, purposed - either on that very occasion, or very shortly after, when his listeners were again gathered together - supplementing this important teaching by another parable, in which the good of having friends in the world to come should be clearly shown. The parable of Lazarus as Dives, then, may be regarded as a piece of teaching following on to and closely connected with the parable of the unjust steward. Nine verses, however, as we have seen are inserted between the two parables. Of these, vers. 10-13 are simply some reflections of the Master on the parable of the steward just spoken. Then comes ver. 14 - a scornful interruption on the part of the Pharisee listeners. Our Lord replies to this (vers. 15-18), and then goes on, either then or very soon after, to the same auditory, with the parable of Lazarus and Dives, which is, in fact, a direct sequel to the parable of the unjust steward, and which St. Luke proceeds to relate without any further preamble. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
