This location is significant in biblical history as a place of prayer and reflection. The Mount of Olives is situated east of Jerusalem and has been a site of many important biblical events. It is also prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> as the place where the Messiah will stand in the end times. The garden setting symbolizes a place of solitude and communion with God, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, where humanity first fell into temptation.<p><b>He told them</b><br>Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. This moment highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers, as He prepares them for the trials ahead. The directive nature of His words underscores the importance of obedience and attentiveness to His teachings, which is a recurring theme throughout the Gospels.<p><b>Pray that you will not enter into temptation</b><br>This instruction underscores the power and necessity of prayer in the life of a believer. Jesus is aware of the impending challenges and spiritual warfare that His disciples will face. The call to prayer is a preventive measure against falling into sin, echoing the Lord's Prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." This moment foreshadows the spiritual battle Jesus Himself is about to endure and serves as a reminder of the human vulnerability to sin without divine assistance. The concept of temptation here is not just about moral failings but encompasses the broader trials and tests of faith that believers encounter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing for His imminent arrest and crucifixion.

This &#8220;place&#8221; was no random stop; it was the spot where He often met with the disciples, a quiet setting chosen for prayer on the eve of the crucifixion. His deliberate arrival reminds us that nothing in God&#8217;s plan is accidental. Much like Abraham&#8217;s calculated journey to Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3&#8211;4</a>) or Elijah&#8217;s trek to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), Jesus steps into a divinely appointed arena where eternal purposes will unfold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He told them</b><p>The Lord doesn&#8217;t merely model prayer; He commands it. Luke notes earlier that &#8220;He was teaching them to pray&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-1.htm">Luke 11:1</a>), and now He turns teaching into urgent directive. The timing&#8212;right before betrayal&#8212;underscores His pastoral heart. Just as Moses exhorted Israel before entering Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>) and Paul charged the Ephesian elders on the beach at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28&#8211;31</a>), Jesus speaks with authority and tenderness, calling His followers to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pray that you will not enter into temptation</b><p>&#8226; Prayer as preventive armor: Jesus echoes His own petition in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, &#8220;Lead us not into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). He knows a spiritual ambush is moments away&#8212;sleepy disciples, Judas&#8217; kiss, swords drawn&#8212;and only vigilant prayer can keep them standing (<a href="/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Temptation&#8217;s triple threat:<p>&#8211; Fear: Peter will soon tremble before a servant girl (<a href="/luke/22-56.htm">Luke 22:56&#8211;57</a>).<p>&#8211; Violence: One disciple will swing a sword (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Despair: All will scatter (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>).<p>Prayer addresses each: courage replaces fear (<a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29&#8211;31</a>), meekness conquers violence (<a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17&#8211;21</a>), and hope overcomes despair (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promised help: <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a> assures a divinely provided escape; <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a> links prayer with the full armor of God; <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a> promises the devil will flee when resisted in humble dependence.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s own example: While urging them to pray, He Himself &#8220;knelt down and prayed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>). <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> pictures Him offering &#8220;prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears,&#8221; proving that prayer is not merely advice&#8212;it is the lifeline He personally grips.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-40.htm">Luke 22:40</a> shows Jesus arriving at a familiar, God-appointed place, issuing an urgent command, and prescribing prayer as the critical shield against imminent spiritual failure. By obeying His words&#8212;staying alert, seeking divine strength, and trusting God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;we follow the same victorious path He marked out in Gethsemane and stand firm when temptation closes in.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40-46) <span class= "bld">When he was at the place.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/26-36.htm" title="Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.">Matthew 26:36-46</a>; <a href="/context/mark/14-32.htm" title="And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit you here, while I shall pray.">Mark 14:32-38</a>.

It is with him simply "<span class= "ital">the</span> place" to which our Lord was wont to resort.<p><span class= "bld">Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span>--The words are suggestive (1) as throwing light on the meaning of the "temptation" clause in the Lord's Prayer, which the disciples were now to use in all the fulness of its meaning; (2) as indicating that our Lord was Himself about to enter on a time of temptation, to which He was called, and from which He would not shrink. And yet even He, too, as the sequel shows, could utter a prayer which was in substance identical with that which He taught the disciples to use.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pray that ye enter not into temptation</span>.
