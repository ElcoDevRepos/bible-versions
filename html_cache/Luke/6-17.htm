The "level place" suggests a setting accessible to a large crowd, contrasting with the more intimate setting of the mountain. This setting is significant as it allows Jesus to address a diverse audience, symbolizing the accessibility of His message to all people. The level place can be seen as a metaphor for the leveling of social and spiritual hierarchies, where all stand equal before God. This setting is reminiscent of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew, though here it is often referred to as the Sermon on the Plain, emphasizing the universality of Jesus' teachings.<p><b>A large crowd of His disciples was there,</b><br>The presence of a large crowd of disciples highlights the growing influence and following of Jesus. These disciples are not just the Twelve Apostles but include a broader group of followers who are committed to learning from Jesus. This gathering reflects the early stages of the Christian community, united by their faith in Jesus and His teachings. The term "disciples" underscores the role of these individuals as learners and followers, committed to the path Jesus is laying out.<p><b>along with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem,</b><br>The mention of Judea and Jerusalem indicates the geographical spread of Jesus' influence. Judea was the region surrounding Jerusalem, the religious and cultural center of Jewish life. The inclusion of people from these areas suggests that Jesus' message was reaching the heart of Jewish religious life, challenging existing religious structures and offering a new understanding of God's kingdom. This diverse audience reflects the fulfillment of prophecies that the Messiah would draw people from all corners of Israel.<p><b>and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.</b><br>Tyre and Sidon were prominent cities in Phoenicia, located along the Mediterranean coast, outside traditional Jewish territories. The inclusion of people from these regions signifies the breaking of ethnic and cultural barriers, foreshadowing the spread of the Gospel to Gentiles. This anticipates the Great Commission, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations. The presence of people from Tyre and Sidon highlights the universal scope of Jesus' mission and the inclusivity of His message, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the nations coming to the light of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who comes down to teach and heal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present with Him, learning and witnessing His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/large_crowd.htm">Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the multitude of people seeking Jesus for His teachings and healing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea_and_jerusalem.htm">Judea and Jerusalem</a></b><br>Regions from which many people traveled to see Jesus, indicating His growing influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre_and_sidon.htm">Tyre and Sidon</a></b><br>Coastal regions, highlighting the reach of Jesus' ministry beyond Jewish territories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_accessibility.htm">Jesus' Accessibility</a></b><br>Jesus comes down to a "level place," symbolizing His approachability and willingness to meet people where they are.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diverse_gathering.htm">Diverse Gathering</a></b><br>The presence of people from Judea, Jerusalem, Tyre, and Sidon illustrates the universal appeal of Jesus' message and the breaking down of cultural barriers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_jesus.htm">Seeking Jesus</a></b><br>The large crowd demonstrates the importance of seeking Jesus for spiritual and physical needs, reflecting a hunger for truth and healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discipleship_and_witness.htm">Discipleship and Witness</a></b><br>The disciples' presence highlights the importance of being close to Jesus, learning from Him, and witnessing His work firsthand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' ministry to both Jews and Gentiles fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's inclusive mission.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_6_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 6:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_17_Jesus_compassion_shown.htm">How does Luke 6:17 demonstrate Jesus' compassion for the multitudes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_in_Luke_6_17.htm">What can we learn from Jesus' actions in Luke 6:17 about serving others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_6_17_to_Sermon_teachings.htm">How does Luke 6:17 connect with Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_mirror_Jesus_with_crowds.htm">In what ways can we emulate Jesus' approach to crowds in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_17_Spirit_over_body_focus.htm">How does Luke 6:17 encourage us to prioritize spiritual needs over physical ones?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_on_level_ground_in_Luke_6_17.htm">What is the significance of Jesus standing on a level place in Luke 6:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_17_Jesus_inclusive_approach.htm">How does Luke 6:17 reflect Jesus' approach to inclusivity and accessibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_gather_from_Judea_Jerusalem_Tyre.htm">Why did people from Judea, Jerusalem, and Tyre and Sidon gather in Luke 6:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_ipsissima_vox_and_verba_differ.htm">How do Ipsissima Vox and Ipsissima Verba differ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_sermon_on_the_plain_about.htm">What is the Sermon on the Plain about?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_reading_the_bible_challenging.htm">What is the Sermon on the Plain about?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/main_theme_of_acts.htm">What is the main theme of the Book of Acts?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 6:17 Mean</div><b>Then Jesus came down with them</b><p>&#8211; Moments earlier, Jesus had spent the night in prayer and appointed the Twelve (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12-16</a>).

In St. Matthew (Matthew 10) the mission of the Twelve is followed by a full discourse on their Apostolic work and its perils. Here it is followed by a discourse which has so many points of resemblance with the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, 6, 7, that many have supposed it to be identical. It is a partial explanation of the difficulty that St. Mark and St. Luke distinguish the choice of the Twelve from their mission, the latter meeting us in <a href="/luke/9-1.htm" title="Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.">Luke 9:1</a>, <a href="/mark/6-7.htm" title="And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;">Mark 6:7</a>, and that in a form which implies the previous existence of the Twelve as a distinct body; but we still have to face the fact that events which St. Mark and St. Luke place even before the choice, St. Matthew places after the mission.

Out of these he called the twelve above mentioned; and titan, with the whole body of disciples - the twelve, no doubt, closest to his Person - he continued the descent for some way. On a level spot situate on the hillside, very likely a fiat space between the two peaks of Hattin, the Master and his followers came upon a crowd of inquirers, who had ascended thus far to meet him. These were composed, as we shall see, of various nationalities. Some came with their sick friends, seeking a cure; some were urged by curiosity; others by a real longing to hear more of the words of life from his Divine lips. It was to this crowd that, surrounded by the newly elected twelve, as well as by the larger company of disciples, that Jesus spoke the famous discourse known as the sermon on the mount. <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him</span>. To the places here enumerated, St. Matthew adds Galilee, Decapolis, and the region beyond Jordan. St. Mark (<a href="/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>) - where the same period of our Lord's ministry is treated of - alludes to people from Idumaea forming part of the multitude which just then used to crowd round the Master as he taught. Thus the great sermon was addressed to men of various nationalities - to rigid and careless Jews, to Romans and Greeks, to Phoenicians from Tyre and Sidon, and to nomad Arabs from Idumaea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] came down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(katabas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2597.htm">Strong's 2597: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go down, come down, either from the sky or from higher land, descend.
