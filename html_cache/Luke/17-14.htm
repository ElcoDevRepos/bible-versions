In biblical context, Jesus often noticed those whom society overlooked, such as lepers. His ability to see beyond physical appearances to the heart of individuals is a recurring theme in the Gospels. This reflects God's omniscience and care for all people, regardless of their social status or condition.<p><b>He said, &#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&#8221;</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judaism, lepers were required by Mosaic Law to present themselves to a priest for examination and declaration of cleanliness (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2-32</a>). This command by Jesus aligns with the law, showing His respect for the Law of Moses. It also demonstrates faith, as the lepers were to act on Jesus' words before seeing any evidence of healing. This act of obedience is a type of faith that is often required in the Christian walk, where believers are called to trust and act on God's promises.<p><b>And as they were on their way,</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of obedience and faith in action. The lepers were healed not immediately, but as they obeyed Jesus' command. This suggests a process of healing that is contingent upon faith and obedience. It parallels other biblical narratives where faith is demonstrated through action, such as the healing of Naaman in <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>.<p><b>they were cleansed.</b><br>The cleansing of the lepers is both a physical and spiritual metaphor. Leprosy in the Bible often symbolizes sin and its isolating effects. The cleansing signifies not only physical healing but also restoration to community and spiritual renewal. This act of cleansing is a type of the redemptive work of Christ, who cleanses believers from sin and restores them to fellowship with God. The healing also fulfills the messianic prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who brings healing and liberation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who gives the command to the lepers.

It did not necessarily imply a journey to Jerusalem. Any priest in any town was qualified for the function of inspecting and deciding on the completeness of the cure.
