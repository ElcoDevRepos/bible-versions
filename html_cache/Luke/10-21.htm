It highlights a pivotal moment of revelation and divine joy.<p><b>Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit</b><br>Jesus' joy is deeply spiritual, rooted in His relationship with the Holy Spirit. This reflects the Trinitarian nature of God, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet unified. The joy signifies divine approval and fulfillment of God's plan.<p><b>and declared, &#8220;I praise You, Father,</b><br>Jesus addresses God as Father, emphasizing the intimate relationship within the Trinity. This term also reflects the Jewish understanding of God as a paternal figure, yet Jesus' use is uniquely personal and authoritative.<p><b>Lord of heaven and earth,</b><br>This title acknowledges God's sovereignty over all creation, echoing Old Testament themes found in Genesis and Psalms. It affirms God's ultimate authority and control over both the spiritual and physical realms.<p><b>because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned,</b><br>The "wise and learned" refers to those who rely on human wisdom and understanding, such as the Pharisees and scribes. This echoes Isaiah's prophecies about the blindness of those who are wise in their own eyes.<p><b>and revealed them to little children.</b><br>"Little children" symbolizes those with humility and openness to God's revelation, contrasting with the self-sufficiency of the learned. This theme is consistent with Jesus' teachings on the kingdom of God belonging to those who are like children.<p><b>Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.</b><br>This phrase underscores God's pleasure in revealing His truths to the humble. It aligns with the biblical theme that God's ways are higher than human ways, as seen in Isaiah and the Beatitudes, where the meek and humble are blessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who expresses joy and gratitude to the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, in whom Jesus rejoices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Lord of heaven and earth," to whom Jesus offers praise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_and_learned.htm">The Wise and Learned</a></b><br>Those who rely on human wisdom and understanding, from whom divine truths are hidden.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_children.htm">Little Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who are humble and open-hearted, to whom divine truths are revealed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_the_spirit.htm">Joy in the Spirit</a></b><br>Jesus' rejoicing in the Holy Spirit serves as a model for believers to find joy in spiritual truths and divine revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_over_human_wisdom.htm">Humility Over Human Wisdom</a></b><br>God values humility over human wisdom.

It indicates what one may call the enthusiasm of spiritual joy more than any other synonym, and conveys the impression that the disciples must have noticed something exceptional in their Lord's look and manner. The verbal agreement with St. Matthew indicates that both the Evangelists must have drawn from a common source, documentary or oral.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit</span>. More than "rejoiced;" the Greek word rather signifies "exulted." Very rarely in the holy story of the life of lives is a hint given us of any gleam of gladness or of joy irradiating the spirit of the Man of sorrows. The exultation of the Blessed here was based upon his conviction that this first success of his own was but the <span class="accented">commencement</span> of a long and weary, but yet, in the end, of a triumphant campaign against the spirits of sin and evil. What <span class="accented">these</span>, in their mortal weakness by the aid of their poor imperfect faith in his Name, had been able to accomplish, was an earnest, a pledge, of the mighty work which his followers would, in the power of the same Name, be enabled to effect in the coming ages. In that solemn hour did Messiah see, in the <span class="accented">far future</span>, of "the travail of his soul," and was satisfied. The absence of all sign of joy in the life of our Lord is well brought out in that touching legend which we find in the spurious letter of P. Lentulus to the senate, that he wept often, but that no one had ever seen him smile. <span class="cmt_word">That thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast</span> <span class="accented">revealed them unto babes</span>. Looking upon his servants after their return from their successful mission, a group made up certainly for the <span class="accented">most</span> part of poor untutored men - fishers, artisans, and the like, children of the people, without rank or position - Jesus thanks the Father that, in the persons of the men chosen to be the instruments of his work, he has looked away from all the ordinary machinery of human influence. As he gazes upon the band of successful missionaries, Jesus thanks the Father that henceforth his servants, if they would be successful, must owe the powers which gave them success entirely to <span class="accented">his</span> training, and not to the world's. <span class="cmt_word">Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight</span>. This is "the only record, outside St. John's Gospel, of a prayer like that which we find in <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. For the most part, we may believe, those prayers were offered apart, on the lonely hillside, in the darkness of night; or, it may be, the disciples shrank in their reverence, or perhaps in the consciousness of their want of capacity, from attempting to record what was so unspeakably sacred. But it is noteworthy that in this exceptional instance we find, both in the prayer and the teaching that follows it in St. Matthew and St. Luke, turns of thought and phrase almost absolutely identical with what is most characteristic of St. John. It is as though this isolated fragment of a higher teaching had been preserved by them as a witness that there was a region upon which they scarcely dared to enter, but into which men were to be led afterwards by the beloved disciple, to whom the Spirit gave power to recall what had been above the reach of the other reporters of his Master's teaching" (Dean Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
