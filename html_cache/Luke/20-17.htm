In the context of <a href="/luke/20.htm">Luke 20</a>, Jesus is in the temple courts, teaching and being questioned by the chief priests and scribes. His direct gaze signifies His confidence and the seriousness of His message. This moment is a confrontation, as Jesus challenges their understanding and authority.<p><b>&#8220;Then what is the meaning of that which is written:</b><br>Jesus often used questions to provoke thought and reflection.

This approach underscores the Jewish tradition of interpreting the Scriptures and highlights Jesus' role as a teacher who reveals deeper truths.<p><b>&#8216;The stone the builders rejected</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, a messianic psalm. The "builders" symbolize the religious leaders of Israel who, in their spiritual blindness, fail to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. The rejection of the stone is a metaphor for their rejection of Jesus, who does not fit their expectations of a political or military leader.<p><b>has become the cornerstone&#8217;?</b><br>The cornerstone is the most crucial stone in a building's foundation, ensuring stability and alignment. In biblical times, it was the first stone set in construction, determining the position of the entire structure. This imagery signifies Jesus' essential role in God's redemptive plan. Despite being rejected, He becomes the foundation of the Church. This concept is echoed in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>, where Jesus is identified as the cornerstone, fulfilling Old Testament prophecy and establishing His preeminence in the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the religious leaders who are questioning His authority.

The husbandmen who had just been described as vine-dressers are now described as builders, and the murdered son is reproduced under the image of a corner, stone tossed aside as useless. In the first part of the picture, the earthly humiliation of Messiah is portrayed when the stone is laid in the earth.
