The centurion, a Roman officer, demonstrates an unusual appreciation for the Jewish nation, suggesting a deep respect for their culture and religion. This love may reflect a broader understanding of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants. The centurion's attitude contrasts with the common Roman view of Jews as a subjugated people, indicating a personal transformation or revelation.<p><b>and has built our synagogue.&#8221;</b><br>The construction of a synagogue by a Roman centurion is noteworthy, as synagogues were central to Jewish community life, serving as places of worship, teaching, and community gatherings. This act of building a synagogue demonstrates the centurion's commitment to the Jewish faith and his willingness to support their religious practices. It also suggests a level of wealth and influence, as building a synagogue would require significant resources. This act of generosity aligns with the biblical principle of supporting God's work, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a>, where King David provides for the temple. The centurion's actions prefigure the inclusion of Gentiles in the faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius, another centurion who receives the Holy Spirit. This foreshadows the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles through Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer commanding a hundred soldiers.
