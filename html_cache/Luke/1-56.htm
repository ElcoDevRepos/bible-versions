Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, is a relative of Mary, which underscores the familial connections within the narrative. This visit also fulfills the angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary that Elizabeth was in her sixth month of pregnancy, serving as a sign of God's power and faithfulness. The meeting between Mary and Elizabeth is marked by the Holy Spirit's presence, as Elizabeth's baby leaps in her womb upon Mary's greeting, indicating the recognition of Jesus' divine nature even before birth.<p><b>for about three months</b><br>The duration of Mary's stay with Elizabeth is approximately the last trimester of Elizabeth's pregnancy. This time frame suggests that Mary was present for the birth of John the Baptist, which would have been a significant event, given John's role as the forerunner of Christ. The three-month period also allows for mutual support and encouragement between Mary and Elizabeth, both of whom are experiencing unique and divinely orchestrated pregnancies. This time together may have provided Mary with spiritual preparation and affirmation of her own role in God's plan.<p><b>and then returned home.</b><br>Mary's return home to Nazareth marks the end of her visit with Elizabeth and the beginning of her own journey as the mother of Jesus. This return signifies her acceptance of the responsibilities and challenges that lie ahead, including the social implications of her pregnancy. Nazareth, a small town in Galilee, is where Mary would face the scrutiny of her community, yet it is also where she would raise Jesus. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of Jesus' life, as Nazareth becomes a significant location in His ministry, fulfilling the prophecy that He would be called a Nazarene.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who was visited by the angel Gabriel and told she would conceive the Son of God.
