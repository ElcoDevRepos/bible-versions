They were often in opposition to the Pharisees, another prominent Jewish group. The Sadducees were associated with the priestly class and held significant power in the temple hierarchy. Their beliefs were more conservative, adhering strictly to the written Torah and rejecting oral traditions upheld by the Pharisees.<p><b>who say there is no resurrection</b><br>The Sadducees denied the resurrection of the dead, a belief that set them apart from the Pharisees, who affirmed it. This denial was rooted in their strict interpretation of the Torah, as they did not find explicit references to the resurrection in the first five books of the Bible. This belief also extended to a denial of angels and spirits, as noted in <a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>. Their theological stance was significant because it influenced their worldview and understanding of life after death, which was a central point of contention with Jesus and the early Christian message.<p><b>came to question Him</b><br>The Sadducees approached Jesus with the intent to challenge His teachings and authority. This encounter is part of a series of confrontations between Jesus and various Jewish leaders during His ministry, particularly in the days leading up to His crucifixion. Their questioning was not a genuine search for truth but rather an attempt to trap Jesus in a theological debate. This reflects the broader context of opposition Jesus faced from religious leaders who felt threatened by His growing influence and His teachings, which often contradicted their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect during the time of Jesus known for their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits.

Jesus will soon overturn their skepticism by rooting the resurrection in the very Pentateuch they claim to follow, proving that all Scripture&#8212;from Moses forward&#8212;testifies to the living God who raises the dead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27-39) <span class= "bld">Then came</span> <span class= "bld">to him certain of the Sadducees.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/22-23.htm" title="The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,">Matthew 22:23-33</a>; <a href="/context/mark/12-18.htm" title="Then come to him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,">Mark 12:18-27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-40.</span> - <span class="accented">The scornful question of the Sadducees bearing on the doctrine of the resurrection, and the Lord's reply.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came to him certain of the Saddducees, which deny that there is</span> <span class="cmt_word">any resurrection; and they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother</span>. This is the only occasion related in the Gospels where our Lord comes in direct conflict with the Sadducees. They were a small but very wealthy and powerful sect. The high priests at this period and their families seem to have belonged generally to this party. They acknowledged as Divine the books of Moses, but refused to see in them any proof of the resurrection, or indeed of life after death. To the prophets and the other books they only attached subordinate importance. Supercilious worldliness, and a quiet indifference to all spiritual things, characterized them at this period. They come, comparatively speaking, little in contact with Jesus during his earthly ministry. While the Pharisee hated the Galilaean Master, the Sadducee professed to look on him rather with contempt. The question here seems to have been put with supercilious scorn. SS. Matthew and Mark preface the Lord's answer with a few words of grave rebuke, exposing the questioners' utter ignorance of the deep things involved in their query. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
