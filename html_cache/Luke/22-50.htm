In the parallel accounts in the Gospels, it is identified as Peter (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>). Peter's impulsive nature is often highlighted in the Gospels, showing his zeal and sometimes rash actions. This moment reflects his desire to protect Jesus, even though Jesus had previously spoken of His need to suffer and die (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21-23</a>).<p><b>struck the servant of the high priest</b><br>The servant is identified as Malchus in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>). The high priest at the time was Caiaphas, who played a significant role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. The high priest's servant would have been part of the group sent to arrest Jesus, indicating the official nature of the arrest. This act of violence contrasts with Jesus' teachings on peace and non-retaliation (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>).<p><b>cutting off his right ear</b><br>The detail of the "right ear" is significant, as it shows the precision of the Gospel accounts. In the cultural context, the right side was often considered the side of favor or strength. The act of cutting off the ear could symbolize the severing of one's ability to hear, which is metaphorically significant given the religious leaders' refusal to hear Jesus' message. Jesus' subsequent healing of Malchus' ear (<a href="/luke/22-51.htm">Luke 22:51</a>) demonstrates His compassion and power, even in the face of betrayal and arrest, fulfilling His role as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospels, the Son of God, who is about to be arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus, present with Him during His arrest.

It will be remembered that all the four Gospels relate the incident, but that St. John alone gives the name of the disciple. It is possibly characteristic of St. Luke's technical accuracy that he uses the diminutive form of "ear," as if part only were cut off. In <a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever.

He gives, too, the servant's name, Malchus. John wrote many years later, when Jerusalem had long ceased to exist; Peter, too, had passed away. Before this incident, St. John relates how the Roman and Jewish guards "went backward, and fell to the ground." <span class="accented">What</span> overawed the party of armed men is un-certain-whether some supernatural or merely a natural cause; possibly something of majesty in the Lord's appearance impelled these men to retire and reverently to salute him they were ordered to seize.
