His question is a rhetorical device, inviting the disciples to express their understanding and feelings about recent events. It reflects Jesus' teaching style, often using questions to provoke thought and reflection. This approach is consistent with His method throughout the Gospels, where He frequently uses questions to lead others to deeper insights (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The disciples refer to Jesus as "Jesus of Nazareth," highlighting His earthly origins and human identity. Nazareth was a small town in Galilee, often regarded with low esteem (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>). This identification emphasizes Jesus' humble beginnings and fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). The mention of "events" indicates the recent crucifixion and the surrounding occurrences, which were well-known in Jerusalem at the time.<p><b>&#8220;This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.</b><br>The disciples describe Jesus as a "prophet," acknowledging His role as a messenger of God. This title connects Jesus to the Old Testament tradition of prophets who spoke God's word and performed miracles, such as Moses and Elijah. His power "in speech and action" refers to His authoritative teaching and miraculous works, which demonstrated His divine authority (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, <a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>). The phrase "before God and all the people" underscores His public ministry and the widespread recognition of His works, aligning with the prophecy in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a> about a prophet like Moses who would speak God's words to the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_of_nazareth.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, recognized here as a prophet.
