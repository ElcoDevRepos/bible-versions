In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, seeds were vital for sustenance and future harvests. The imagery of seeds shriveling beneath the clods indicates a lack of moisture and fertility, symbolizing spiritual barrenness and judgment. This can be connected to the covenant curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>, where disobedience leads to drought and famine. The shriveled seeds also serve as a metaphor for the spiritual state of the people, who have turned away from God and are experiencing the consequences of their actions.<p><b>the storehouses are in ruins;</b><br>Storehouses were essential for storing surplus grain and other produce, ensuring food security during times of scarcity. The ruin of these structures signifies not only physical devastation but also economic collapse and insecurity. This reflects the broader theme of divine judgment throughout the book of Joel, where the land's desolation mirrors the spiritual desolation of the people. The destruction of storehouses can be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings, such as those found in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>, where neglecting God's house leads to economic hardship.<p><b>the granaries are broken down,</b><br>Granaries were used to protect and preserve the harvest. Their breakdown indicates a complete loss of resources and the inability to sustain life. This imagery underscores the severity of the locust plague and drought described in Joel, serving as a call to repentance. The broken granaries symbolize the futility of relying on material wealth and human efforts without God's blessing. This can be compared to the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where storing up earthly treasures without being rich toward God leads to ruin.<p><b>for the grain has withered away.</b><br>The withering of grain represents the culmination of the agricultural disaster. Grain was a staple food, and its loss meant famine and starvation. This phrase highlights the direct impact of the locust plague and drought on the people's livelihood. It serves as a reminder of the dependence on God's provision and the consequences of turning away from Him. The withered grain can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). Just as the physical grain withers without water, spiritual life withers without Christ, emphasizing the need for spiritual renewal and reliance on Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/locust_plague.htm">Locust Plague</a></b><br>A devastating event described in Joel, symbolizing both a literal and a spiritual crisis.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/storehouses_and_granaries.htm">Storehouses and Granaries</a></b><br>Structures used for storing grain, representing the economic and agricultural stability of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seeds_and_grain.htm">Seeds and Grain</a></b><br>Essential elements for sustenance and growth, symbolizing potential and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_drought.htm">Spiritual Drought</a></b><br>Just as physical seeds can shrivel, so can spiritual seeds if neglected.

This is not merely agricultural failure; it is a visible sign of divine judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="/haggai/1-10.htm">Haggai 1:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, seed often points to hope and future harvest (<a href="/mark/4-26.htm">Mark 4:26&#8211;29</a>). When the seed itself shrivels, hope is choked off. The verse shows how sin and complacency can drain even the earliest stages of promised blessing.<p>&#8226; The land&#8217;s barrenness mirrors spiritual barrenness. Just as the seed cannot sprout in parched dirt, hearts hardened by neglect of God cannot produce righteousness (<a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the storehouses are in ruins</b><p>&#8226; Storehouses were built to protect abundance (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48&#8211;49</a>). Their collapse means reserves are empty and security is gone.<p>&#8226; The image echoes God&#8217;s warning that prosperity without obedience is fragile (<a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19&#8211;20</a>). What people trusted to sustain them has failed.<p>&#8226; It presses home the message that only the Lord is a sure refuge; earthly provisions crumble when His blessing is withheld (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the granaries are broken down</b><p>&#8226; Granaries&#8212;stronger, larger barns&#8212;were symbols of lasting wealth (<a href="/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18</a>). Their breaking down illustrates long-term devastation, not just a single bad season.<p>&#8226; The decay is so extensive that even structures designed for durability cannot stand (<a href="/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10&#8211;12</a>). Sin&#8217;s consequences dismantle what human strength tries to preserve.<p>&#8226; The people are forced to acknowledge that no human plan can outlast God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the grain has withered away</b><p>&#8226; This final phrase explains the entire chain reaction: without grain, there is no harvest, no storage, no food. Life grinds to a halt.<p>&#8226; It echoes <a href="/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>, where joy itself withers. Material loss spreads into emotional and spiritual desolation (<a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture also uses withering to drive people toward repentance and renewed dependence on the Lord who can restore what is lost (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-18.htm">Psalm 80:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a> paints a vivid, step-by-step picture of judgment: seed that never germinates, empty barns collapsing, and grain entirely gone. Every stage underscores that when God&#8217;s people ignore Him, even their most basic hopes and safeguards fail. The verse invites us to face the seriousness of sin, recognize the futility of self-reliance, and turn back to the only One who can revive both land and heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The corn is withered.--</span>The results of the terrible drought, coincident with the ravages of the locusts, are now described.
