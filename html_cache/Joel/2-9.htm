In the context of Joel, it describes an army, possibly locusts or a foreign military force, symbolizing God's impending judgment on Israel for their sins. The imagery of a city being stormed is reminiscent of ancient warfare tactics, where cities were often besieged and overrun by enemy forces. This can be connected to the Babylonian invasion of Jerusalem, which was a historical fulfillment of such prophecies. The city represents human civilization and its defenses, which are ultimately powerless against divine intervention.<p><b>they run along the wall;</b><br>Walls in ancient times were crucial for a city's defense, symbolizing security and protection. The image of invaders running along the wall suggests a breach of security and the futility of human defenses against the judgment of God. This can be seen as a warning to the people of Israel to not rely on their own strength or fortifications but to turn to God for true protection. The swift movement along the wall indicates the relentless and unstoppable nature of the judgment coming upon them.<p><b>they climb into houses,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness and inescapability of the invasion. In ancient Near Eastern culture, houses were considered places of refuge and safety. The invaders climbing into houses signifies that no place is safe from the impending judgment. This can be seen as a call to personal repentance, as even the most private and secure areas of life are subject to God's scrutiny and judgment.<p><b>entering through windows like thieves.</b><br>The comparison to thieves highlights the unexpected and unwelcome nature of the invasion. Thieves enter stealthily and with intent to take what is not theirs, which parallels the suddenness and destructiveness of the judgment described. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, where the Day of the Lord is said to come "like a thief in the night." It serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and readiness for the Lord's return, urging believers to live in a state of spiritual preparedness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locust_army.htm">The Locust Army</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>, the prophet describes an invading army, often interpreted as a swarm of locusts or a metaphor for a human army.

In the immediate context, the locust horde sweeps past every barrier; prophetically, the coming Day of the LORD will bring armies&#8212;or divine judgment itself&#8212;against every human stronghold.<p>&#8226; The phrasing reflects irresistible advance; no defence deters them (cf. <a href="/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4&#8211;6</a>, &#8220;the chariots storm through the streets&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God is showing Israel that rebellion cannot hide behind walls; His judgment reaches the very heart of civic security (see <a href="/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the Assyrians of old or the final armies of <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7-9</a>, the invaders act as instruments in God&#8217;s hand, demonstrating that &#8220;The LORD thunders at the head of His army&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They run along the wall</b><p>Walls symbolize safety, yet these attackers treat them like level ground.<p>&#8226; Their agility mirrors locusts crawling over every surface (<a href="/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, no human boundary&#8212;legal, political, or religious&#8212;halts divine discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, &#8220;Go through her vineyards and ravage them&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It anticipates the end-times scene where &#8220;the cities of the nations collapsed&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>), underscoring that earthly fortifications fail when God acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They climb into houses</b><p>The devastation moves from public spaces to private dwellings.<p>&#8226; Locusts pour through doorways; invading troops break down doors with equal ease (cf. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>, &#8220;I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Judgment is personal. Just as God spared Israel during Passover only by the blood-marked door (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>), so individuals must find refuge in Him, not in bricks.<p>&#8226; The picture echoes <a href="/jeremiah/9-21.htm">Jeremiah 9:21</a>, &#8220;Death has climbed in through our windows; it has entered our fortresses,&#8221; warning that complacency inside our homes cannot shield us from God&#8217;s righteous dealings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Entering through windows like thieves</b><p>The imagery turns almost stealth-like, emphasizing suddenness and total penetration.<p>&#8226; Thieves bypass normal entry; so judgment arrives where least expected (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, &#8220;the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Jesus later uses similar language for His own unexpected return (<a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>). Joel therefore foreshadows both historical invasion and ultimate eschatological fulfillment.<p>&#8226; For those unprepared, the experience is loss; for those who heed the warning, it spurs repentance (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a> paints a vivid four-step portrait of unstoppable judgment: it breaches civic defenses, overcomes walls, invades private homes, and enters like a stealthy thief. Every layer of human security crumbles before the LORD&#8217;s appointed army, whether literal locusts, historical invaders, or the final Day of the LORD. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to turn from self-reliance to wholehearted repentance, trusting the only sure refuge&#8212;His mercy promised in the verses that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall run to and fro in the city</span> (or rush to the assault of the city. Wunsche, and so LXX., "They shall seize upon the city"); <span class="cmt_word">they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief</span>. In the first clause the comparison with an army still continues. The attack has succeeded, the city has been taken by assault, the victorious troops are running to and fro in the city; so far the locusts are fitly represented by an army vigorous in its advance, steady in its march, resistless in its assault, victorious in its attack, and masters of the captured city. The remainder of the ninth verse is not equally applicable to the figure and the fact in common, but belongs exclusively to the locusts themselves; they creep up the wall, climb up upon the houses, and find ingress even at the windows. "There is no road," says Jerome, "impassable to locusts. They penetrate into fields, and crops, and trees, and cities, and even the recesses of the bedchambers;" while Theodoret remarks of locusts that" not only when flying, but by creeping along the walls, they pass through the windows into the houses themselves." Thus there was no spot to which they could not find access, and no place secure from their assault. <span class="accented">Yashoqqu.</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi both connect this word with <span class="accented">shoq</span>, a leg. The latter says, "It has the signification of <span class="accented">shoq</span>, a leg, and he mentions this word in respect to the locust, because its legs are long; and further, because it is continually going and seldom resting; and thus he (Isaiah) says, 'As the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them,' as if he said, 'a continual going up and down.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They storm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1431;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#333;q&#183;q&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8264.htm">Strong's 8264: </a> </span><span class="str2">To course, to seek greedily</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the city;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
