The silver and gold symbolize not only material wealth but also the spiritual treasures of Israel, which were dedicated to God. Historically, these metals were often used in the construction and adornment of the temple in Jerusalem, signifying their sacred purpose. The act of taking these items represents a violation of what was consecrated to God, reflecting a broader theme of desecration and disrespect for the divine.<p><b>and carried off My finest treasures</b><br>The "finest treasures" likely refer to the sacred objects used in worship, which held both religious and cultural significance. This act of carrying off treasures is reminiscent of the Babylonian exile when the temple was plundered, and its sacred items were taken to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). The removal of these treasures signifies a loss of divine presence and blessing, as these items were integral to the worship and identity of Israel as God's chosen people.<p><b>to your temples</b><br>The phrase indicates that the stolen treasures were taken to pagan temples, suggesting a transfer of what was holy to a profane context. This act can be seen as an affront to God, as it implies the subjugation of the God of Israel to the deities of the surrounding nations. It echoes the theme of idolatry and the spiritual adultery that Israel often fell into, as seen in other prophetic books like Hosea. Theologically, this can be viewed as a type of Christ, where the true temple, Jesus, was desecrated and rejected by the world, yet ultimately triumphed over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel is the author of the book that bears his name.

This was at once the climax of their cruelty and the aggravation of their crime. The object which their enemies had in view in selling the Hebrew captives to the sons of Javan, or Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor, was by that remote exile to prevent the possibility of their return to their own land. The historic reference is thought by some to be the event narrated in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16, 17</a>, where it is written, "The Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines...
