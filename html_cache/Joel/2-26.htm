In the ancient Near Eastern context, agricultural prosperity was a sign of divine favor. The promise of plenty contrasts with the earlier descriptions of famine and scarcity in <a href="/joel/1.htm">Joel 1</a>. This abundance is reminiscent of God's covenant blessings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11-12</a>, where obedience leads to prosperity. It also foreshadows the eschatological hope of a future where God's people will experience fullness and satisfaction, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16-17</a>.<p><b>You will praise the name of the LORD your God,</b><br>Praising God's name signifies acknowledging His character and deeds. In Hebrew culture, a name encapsulates the essence of a person. Here, it emphasizes gratitude and recognition of God's sovereignty and mercy. This response of praise is a fulfillment of the covenant relationship, where God's people respond to His blessings with worship. It connects to the broader biblical theme of worship as a response to God's redemptive acts, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-5</a> and <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>.<p><b>who has worked wonders for you.</b><br>The wonders refer to God's miraculous interventions and acts of deliverance. In the Old Testament, wonders often denote God's mighty acts, such as the plagues in Egypt or the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 7-14). These acts serve as reminders of God's power and faithfulness. In Joel, the restoration of the land and the outpouring of the Spirit (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>) are seen as divine wonders. This phrase also points to the ultimate wonder of salvation through Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection are the greatest acts of divine intervention.<p><b>My people will never again be put to shame.</b><br>Shame in the biblical context often relates to defeat, disgrace, or the consequences of sin. This promise assures God's people of their restored honor and security. It reflects the covenantal promise of protection and blessing for obedience (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>). The assurance of no more shame is eschatological, pointing to a future where God's people will live in eternal security and honor, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. This phrase also echoes the hope found in <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>, where belief in Christ ensures that one will not be put to shame.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel's message is one of both warning and hope, calling the people of Judah to repentance and promising restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced devastation due to locust plagues and other calamities, prompting Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises restoration and blessings to His people following their repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/locust_plague.htm">Locust Plague</a></b><br>A significant event in the book of Joel, symbolizing both literal and metaphorical devastation, which leads to a call for repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of God restoring His people, providing abundance and removing their shame, as promised in <a href="/joel/2-26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_satisfaction.htm">God's Provision and Satisfaction</a></b><br>God promises to provide abundantly for His people, ensuring their needs are met and they are satisfied.

The locust invasion (2:1&#8211;11) had stripped every green thing, but repentance (2:12&#8211;17) brought a divine reversal. The promise touches daily life: food on the table until hunger is gone. God&#8217;s character is on display as Provider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a> echoes the same cycle: &#8220;When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land He has given you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a> reminds us that the righteous are never forsaken, &#8220;nor their children begging for bread.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus applies the principle universally in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;33</a>, urging trust because &#8220;your heavenly Father knows that you need them.&#8221;<p>Old Covenant Israel saw barns refilled (<a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>); New-Covenant believers see the same Provider meeting needs, whether through a paycheck, a neighbor&#8217;s generosity, or miraculous supply. The Scripture&#8217;s literal promise of provision fuels confidence for every grocery bill and global shortage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you</b><p>Provision is never an end in itself; it ignites worship. Gratitude turns full stomachs into full hearts. Notice the order: first plenty, then praise.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1&#8211;2</a> teaches the same reflex: &#8220;Bless the LORD, O my soul&#8230; forget not all His benefits.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> calls His deeds &#8220;wonders,&#8221; the identical word Joel uses; the God who split the Red Sea still intervenes.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a> celebrates, &#8220;I will exalt You; I will praise Your name, for You have worked wonders&#8212; plans formed long ago in perfect faithfulness.&#8221;<p>Our praise centers on His &#8220;name,&#8221; a term that gathers every attribute&#8212;holiness, power, mercy&#8212;into one banner. In practical terms, this looks like testifying publicly, singing corporately, and thanking Him privately for every &#8220;wonder,&#8221; from a healed marriage to a healed body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My people will never again be put to shame</b><p>Shame in Joel&#8217;s context was agricultural ruin, military defeat, and ridicule from surrounding nations (2:17). God pledges final vindication.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a> assures, &#8220;Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a> applies the principle to every believer: &#8220;Everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a> cites the same foundation&#8212;Christ the cornerstone guarantees that trusting hearts will not end in disgrace.<p>Historically, Judah experienced a foretaste when the crops rebounded and enemies withdrew. Prophetically, the promise stretches to the Millennial Kingdom when Israel&#8217;s reproach is forever removed (<a href="/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17&#8211;21</a>). Personally, believers cling to it whenever accusations, past failures, or cultural scorn threaten identity: in Christ, shame&#8217;s verdict is permanently overturned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/2-26.htm">Joel 2:26</a> paints a threefold portrait of restoration: full tables, full hearts, and lifted heads. God literally meets physical needs, stirs grateful worship, and banishes disgrace from His people&#8217;s story. The verse invites every believer to trust His provision today, celebrate His wonders aloud, and walk in the honor secured by His covenant faithfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will have plenty to eat,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
