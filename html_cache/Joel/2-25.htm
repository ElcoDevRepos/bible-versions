The locusts symbolize devastation and loss, often seen as a divine judgment. In the ancient Near East, locust plagues were common and could destroy entire harvests, leading to famine. This promise of repayment indicates God's mercy and willingness to restore what was lost due to judgment. It reflects the broader biblical theme of restoration found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>.<p><b>the swarming locust, the young locust, the destroying locust, and the devouring locust&#8212;</b><br>These terms describe different stages or types of locusts, emphasizing the totality of the destruction. In the context of Joel, this imagery represents a comprehensive judgment. The repetition underscores the severity of the calamity. Locusts are often used in the Bible as instruments of God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a> during the plagues of Egypt. This imagery also serves as a metaphor for spiritual desolation and the need for repentance.<p><b>My great army that I sent against you.</b><br>Here, God refers to the locusts as "My great army," indicating His sovereignty over creation and His use of natural events to fulfill divine purposes. This aligns with the biblical understanding that God can use even destructive forces to bring about His will, as seen in <a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>. The phrase underscores the idea that the calamity was not random but a purposeful act of God to bring His people to repentance. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory and restoration through Christ, who conquers all forms of spiritual devastation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel is the author of the book that bears his name.
