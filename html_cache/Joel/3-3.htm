Casting lots was common in the ancient Near East and is mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as the division of land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and the soldiers casting lots for Jesus' garments (<a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>). Here, it underscores the dehumanization and commodification of God's people, treating them as mere objects. This reflects the severity of the judgment against the nations for their mistreatment of Israel, highlighting the divine ownership and protection over His people.<p><b>they bartered a boy for a prostitute</b><br>This phrase illustrates the extreme moral degradation and exploitation present during the time. The trading of a boy for a prostitute signifies a complete disregard for human dignity and the sanctity of life. In the ancient world, children were often seen as valuable for labor or as future contributors to the family lineage. The act of exchanging a child for temporary pleasure indicates a society deeply entrenched in sin and corruption. This echoes the warnings found in other prophetic books, such as Amos, where social injustices and exploitation are condemned (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>).<p><b>and sold a girl for wine to drink.</b><br>The selling of a girl for wine further emphasizes the theme of exploitation and the prioritization of indulgence over human life. Wine, often associated with celebration and abundance, here becomes a symbol of excess and moral decay. This transaction reflects a culture that values material and sensual gratification over the welfare of its most vulnerable members. The prophets frequently denounce such behavior, calling for justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>). This phrase also serves as a stark contrast to the biblical view of children as blessings from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>), highlighting the depth of the nations' transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The primary subjects of this verse, representing God's chosen people who have been mistreated and devalued by their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemies_of_israel.htm">The Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>These are the nations or groups that have oppressed Israel, treating them as commodities rather than human beings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_casting_lots.htm">The Act of Casting Lots</a></b><br>This refers to the practice of dividing spoils or making decisions by chance, indicating the dehumanization and objectification of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bartering_a_boy_for_a_prostitute.htm">Bartering a Boy for a Prostitute</a></b><br>This highlights the moral depravity and exploitation, where a child is traded for sexual immorality.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/selling_a_girl_for_wine.htm">Selling a Girl for Wine</a></b><br>This underscores the disregard for human life, where a girl is sold merely to satisfy temporary desires.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_human_life.htm">The Value of Human Life</a></b><br>Every person is made in the image of God and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead of recognizing them as God&#8217;s covenant people, the invaders treat them like spoils of war. Scripture gives several snapshots of this same cruelty:<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 11</a>, &#8220;You stood aloof&#8230; foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a> shows Nineveh&#8217;s victims, &#8220;Lots were cast for her nobles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In contrast, God declares in <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> that whoever touches Israel &#8220;touches the apple of His eye.&#8221;<p>By highlighting the casting of lots, Joel stresses both the humiliating degradation of Judah and the certainty that God has taken notice. Just as He judged Babylon for mocking sacred vessels (<a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1&#8211;6</a>), He will judge nations that gamble with His people&#8217;s lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they bartered a boy for a prostitute</b><p>The scene turns darker: a single Hebrew boy fetches the price of one illicit night. What does that reveal?<p>&#8226; Human life is viewed as less valuable than a moment&#8217;s pleasure&#8212;echoing <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a> where Israel &#8220;sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Immorality and slavery feed off each other; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13&#8211;14</a> links rampant prostitution to national apostasy.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law had forbidden prostitution (<a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>) and required that children be protected, not trafficked (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>So Joel exposes a world turned upside down: instead of raising children in covenant truth, enemies are trading them to satisfy lust. The Lord&#8217;s coming judgment (<a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a>) will answer such perversion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sold a girl for wine to drink</b><p>If the boy is exchanged for sexual sin, the girl is sold to finance drunkenness. A child is worth only a skin of wine to these traders. Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a> condemns those who &#8220;drink wine taken as fines&#8221; beside pagan altars.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-13.htm">Revelation 18:13</a> lists &#8220;slaves&#8212;human souls&#8221; among Babylon&#8217;s luxuries, showing that end-times commercialism repeats ancient cruelty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns that wine &#8220;is a mocker,&#8221; and here it mocks the dignity of this little girl.<p>The transaction reveals utter callousness: captors will sacrifice a child&#8217;s future for a fleeting buzz. God&#8217;s justice in <a href="/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a> (&#8220;Egypt will become a desolation&#8221;) fits perfectly&#8212;He will dry up the wine of wickedness and rescue the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a> paints three strokes of the same atrocity: God&#8217;s people are gambled away, boys are swapped for immorality, and girls are traded for intoxication. The literal outrage of human trafficking in Joel&#8217;s day foreshadows every form of exploitation until Christ returns. Because the Lord witnesses each lot cast, each bargain struck, and each sale finalized, He promises decisive judgment on the nations and ultimate restoration for His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Cast lots</span> . . .--The nations who oppressed and carried away the Jews treated them as chattels, cast lots for the possession of them as slaves, and purchased a night's revelry or other indulgence with the captives they had taken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink</span>. Such was the contumely with which they were treated at the time of the great catastrophe referred to. The captives were distributed by lot among the conquerors; these in turn sold them to the slave-dealers for the merest trifle - a slave-boy for the hire of a harlot, or a slave-girl for a glass or draught of wine. Such treatment had been predicted ages before, and was verified by contemporaneous history (comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> for the prediction; and Josephus, . De Bell. Jud., 6.9.2,3, for the fulfilment). Ninety-seven thousand prisoners were disposed of as follows: those under seventeen years of age were publicly sold; some exiled to work in Egyptian mines; others reserved to fight with wild beasts in the amphi-theatre. Also in the time of Hadrian four Jewish captives were sold for a measure of barley. Nay, more, the Syrian commander, Nicanor, bargained by anticipation for the sale of such Jews as should be taken cap-tire in the Maccabean war. The prophet, moreover, looks forward in prophetic vision to the day of final judgment, when God will, in just retribution, pour out the vials of his wrath on all the oppressors of his Church and people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They cast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yad&#183;d&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3032.htm">Strong's 3032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To handle, to throw, lots</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lots</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1486.htm">Strong's 1486: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lot -- a lot (for casting)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
