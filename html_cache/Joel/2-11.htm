In biblical context, God's voice is often associated with creation, judgment, and authority (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>). The "army" here can be interpreted as both a literal and metaphorical force, possibly referring to the locusts described earlier in Joel or a future eschatological army. This imagery aligns with other Old Testament passages where God leads His people into battle (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>).<p><b>Indeed, His camp is very large,</b><br>The vastness of God's camp signifies His omnipotence and the overwhelming nature of His forces. This can be seen as a reflection of the heavenly host, the angelic beings who serve God (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). The size of the camp also underscores the comprehensive reach of God's judgment and presence, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>for mighty are those who obey His command.</b><br>This highlights the strength and effectiveness of those who follow God's directives. In biblical history, obedience to God often results in victory and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The might of these followers can be seen as both physical and spiritual, drawing parallels to the faithful remnant who remain true to God's covenant (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p><b>For the Day of the LORD is great and very dreadful.</b><br>The "Day of the LORD" is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, signifying a time of divine intervention, judgment, and salvation (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>). It is described as both "great" and "dreadful," indicating its dual nature as a time of both deliverance for the faithful and destruction for the wicked. This day is often associated with end-times prophecy and the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan.<p><b>Who can endure it?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the severity and inevitability of God's judgment. It echoes similar sentiments found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>, where the overwhelming nature of God's presence and judgment is emphasized. The question serves as a call to repentance and reflection, urging individuals to consider their standing before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign and commands His army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_army.htm">His Army</a></b><br>Represents the forces, both natural and supernatural, that God uses to execute His judgment and fulfill His purposes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A significant time of divine intervention, characterized by judgment and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to the people of Judah, calling them to repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, and His purposes will be accomplished.
