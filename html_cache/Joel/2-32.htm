The concept of calling on the name of the LORD is rooted in the Hebrew tradition of invoking God's presence and power. It signifies a personal relationship and reliance on God. This promise of salvation is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>, where Paul reiterates this assurance, highlighting its fulfillment in Christ. The idea of "calling on the name" also connects to the practice of prayer and worship, indicating a sincere turning to God in faith.<p><b>for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance,</b><br>Mount Zion and Jerusalem hold significant theological and historical importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. In the context of Joel, this deliverance is both a physical and spiritual salvation, pointing to God's protection and restoration of His people. Historically, Jerusalem was seen as the dwelling place of God, and thus a place of refuge. This prophecy also foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, who would bring ultimate deliverance. The mention of Mount Zion is often symbolic of God's kingdom and His eternal reign.<p><b>as the LORD has promised,</b><br>This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God to His covenant promises. Throughout the Old Testament, God made covenants with His people, assuring them of His steadfast love and commitment. The promise of deliverance is consistent with God's character and His previous acts of salvation, such as the Exodus. It reassures the faithful that God's word is trustworthy and that He will fulfill His promises in His perfect timing.<p><b>among the remnant called by the LORD.</b><br>The concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, referring to a faithful group preserved by God amidst judgment or calamity. This remnant is chosen by God, highlighting His sovereignty and grace. In the context of Joel, the remnant represents those who remain faithful to God despite widespread apostasy. This idea is further developed in the New Testament, where the remnant includes all who believe in Christ, both Jew and Gentile. The calling by the LORD indicates divine election and purpose, assuring believers of their place in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises salvation and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_zion.htm">Mount Zion</a></b><br>A significant hill in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's holy presence and the center of His divine activity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, representing the place of God's chosen people and His redemptive work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>A group of faithful believers preserved by God, who remain true to Him amidst widespread apostasy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_callers.htm">The Callers</a></b><br>Those who invoke the name of the LORD, seeking His salvation and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_salvation.htm">The Universality of Salvation</a></b><br>Salvation is available to "everyone" who calls on the name of the LORD, emphasizing God's inclusive offer of grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_calling_on_the_lord.htm">The Importance of Calling on the LORD</a></b><br>Actively calling on God's name signifies faith and reliance on His power and mercy for salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_deliverance.htm">The Promise of Deliverance</a></b><br>God's promise of deliverance is sure and steadfast, providing hope and assurance to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_remnant.htm">The Role of the Remnant</a></b><br>God preserves a faithful remnant, demonstrating His sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_mount_zion_and_jerusalem.htm">The Significance of Mount Zion and Jerusalem</a></b><br>These locations symbolize God's presence and the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes, pointing to the ultimate salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joel_2_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joel 2:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joel_2_32_Importance_of_calling_God.htm">How does Joel 2:32 emphasize the importance of calling on the Lord's name?

They were the stage for David&#8217;s throne, Solomon&#8217;s temple, and ultimately the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/luke/24-46.htm">Luke 24:46&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetically, this points forward to a future rescue of Israel when the nations gather against her (<a href="/zechariah/14-1.htm">Zechariah 14:1&#8211;5</a>). <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 17</a> echoes, &#8220;But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Spiritually, Zion symbolizes the secure dwelling of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).

Salvation is never earned; it springs from God&#8217;s sovereign choice (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The remnant theme stretches into <a href="/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>, where faithful believers endure to the end.
