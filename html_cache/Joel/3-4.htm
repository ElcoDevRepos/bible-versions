Tyre and Sidon were prominent Phoenician cities, known for their wealth and trade. Historically, these regions had conflicts with Israel, often allying with other nations against God's people. The rhetorical question implies that these nations have acted against God Himself by opposing His chosen people. This reflects the biblical principle that hostility towards Israel is seen as hostility towards God (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>Are you rendering against Me a recompense?</b><br>The term "recompense" suggests a repayment or retaliation. This implies that Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia might believe they are justified in their actions against Israel, perhaps as a form of vengeance or retribution. In the ancient Near Eastern context, conflicts often involved cycles of revenge. However, the question underscores the futility of attempting to repay God, who is sovereign and just.<p><b>If you retaliate against Me,</b><br>This phrase highlights the seriousness of their actions as being directly against God. Retaliation against God is portrayed as a grave error, emphasizing the divine protection over Israel. The notion of retaliation suggests a cycle of violence and retribution common in ancient conflicts, but it also points to the spiritual reality that opposing God's will is ultimately self-destructive.<p><b>I will swiftly and speedily return your recompense upon your heads.</b><br>Here, God promises a swift and decisive response to any acts of retaliation. The imagery of recompense "upon your heads" indicates personal and direct consequences for their actions. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where God ensures that those who oppose Him and His people face the consequences of their actions. It also echoes the principle found in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where God declares that vengeance belongs to Him. The assurance of swift justice serves as a warning to the nations and a comfort to Israel, affirming God's active role in defending His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre_and_sidon.htm">Tyre and Sidon</a></b><br>Ancient Phoenician cities known for their wealth and trade.

Tyre and Zidon had oppressed the Jews in the time of the judges, and would do so again: the Philistines also were to the last the inveterate enemies of Israel; but in the end, could they measure strength with God?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - In these verses the prophet pauses before proceeding to describe the final judgment of the world-powers for their hostility to and oppression of his Church, and points out the bitter enmity of neigh-bouring nations to the covenant people in the prophet's own day, with a prediction of the righteous retribution that awaited them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The northern sea-board of the Phoenicians, including the famous cities of Tyre and Sidon, also the southern sea-coast and plain of the Philistines, with their five principalities, are joined by <span class="accented">vegam</span> with the nations notorious for injuring and oppressing the people of God. The words rendered in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">What have ye to do with me?</span> rather mean, <span class="accented">What would ye with</span> me? or still better, <span class="accented">What are ye to me</span>? that is. how worthless and despicable in my sight! The disjunctive question which follows becomes clearer by adopting the rendering of Keil and Wunsche, <span class="cmt_word">Will ye repay me a deed, or do anything against me?</span> that is, will ye repay me some wrong-doing which ye fancy I have inflicted on you? or will ye, without such supposed provocation, and of your own free will, do or attempt to do anything against me? The double question with <span class="accented">veim</span> instead of <span class="accented">im</span> repeats, in other words or in a modified form, the preceding question; while the question itself, as often, implies a negative sense to the effect that they had neither right nor reason for averting themselves on the people of God - for God here identifies himself with his people - nor for attempting wantonly and gratuitously to harm them. The consequence would only be a swift and speedy return of the mischief on their own head, so that, as is usual with the wicked, they fall themselves into the pit which they dig for others. The idea of revenge rather than of punishment gets too great prominence in the old versions and commentators. The comment of Kimchi is instructive, though more in harmony with the rendering of the Authorized Version than with that which we prefer; it is as follows: "What have I to do with you, that ye enter my land while ye are neighbours? and it behoved you to do good to my people, but ye have not done so; but when ye saw that the kings of the nations (Gentiles)came upon them, ye allied yourselves with them to plunder and spoil.... Why is it, then, that ye are doing evil to me, if ye think to avenge yourselves of me because I have done you evil? When did I do you evil? Or if you will say that of yourselves ye are doing evil to me now, for he that does evil to Israel from his thought of doing evil to me, they are my children... swiftly and suddenly will I return your doing on your own head." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
