Historically, the "northern army" could be associated with Assyrian or Babylonian forces, known for their invasions from the north. This reflects God's protection over Israel, a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God acts as a deliverer of His people. It also echoes the deliverance narratives found in Exodus and other prophetic books.<p><b>banishing it to a barren and desolate land</b><br>The imagery of a barren and desolate land signifies total defeat and humiliation for the invading army. In biblical times, being driven into such a land meant being cut off from resources and life, symbolizing God's judgment. This can be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, where the enemies of God's people are rendered powerless and isolated.<p><b>its front ranks into the Eastern Sea, and its rear guard into the Western Sea</b><br>The Eastern Sea likely refers to the Dead Sea, while the Western Sea is the Mediterranean. This geographical description emphasizes the complete scattering and destruction of the enemy forces. The division into front and rear suggests a total rout, with no possibility of regrouping. This imagery is reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing, where God similarly destroyed the Egyptian army.<p><b>And its stench will rise; its foul odor will ascend</b><br>The rising stench and foul odor symbolize the aftermath of destruction and death. In ancient cultures, the smell of decay was a powerful reminder of mortality and divine judgment. This phrase underscores the totality of the enemy's defeat and serves as a warning to those who oppose God's will.<p><b>For He has done great things</b><br>This concluding phrase attributes the victory and deliverance to God's mighty acts. It is a call to recognize and praise God's sovereignty and power. The "great things" can be seen as both the immediate deliverance from the northern army and the broader acts of salvation throughout Israel's history. This echoes other biblical passages that celebrate God's mighty deeds, such as in the Psalms and the Magnificat in Luke.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_northern_army.htm">The Northern Army</a></b><br>This refers to the invading forces that threatened Israel.

The verse moves from threat, to removal, to praise, assuring believers that the God who judges enemies also secures and exalts His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The northern army.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">him of the north.</span> "This is an exception to the usual direction of the flight of locusts" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> but it may be literally applied to the Assyrian hordes, whom the Jews generally spoke of as dwelling in the north. In <a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.">Jeremiah 1:13</a> the symbolical caldron is represented as pouring its contents (the Chaldaean army) southwards from the face of the north. And even though the wind might be conceived as capriciously blowing the locusts from the north, yet the addition of the patronymic syllable to the Hebrew word indicates a <span class= "ital">native</span> of the north, which excludes a reference to locusts. Under the image of the destruction of the locusts, the prophet points to the deliverance from the northern invaders.<p>The east sea is the Dead Sea; the utmost or hinder sea is the Mediterranean; the desolate land is the southern desert. The northern invader shall be expelled all along the coasts of Palestine. His stink shall come up. In the eighth plague of Egypt, when on the repentance of Pharaoh the locusts were removed, they were cast into the Red Sea, and there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-19.htm" title="And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.">Exodus 10:19</a>). In the present instance there is the result stated in the case of the decomposition of the bodies of the locusts left on the land: the air was infected with a horrible pestilence. There are various allusions to this terrible result of their putrefaction in the writers who describe the horrors of a plague of locusts. St. Jerome tells of the awful sufferings inflicted on man and beast through this cause; and St. Augustine (<span class= "ital">De Civitate Dei,</span> iii. 31) relates that eight hundred thousand men perished from this reason in the kingdom of Masinissa alone, besides many more near the coast. Thus Joel declares the complete destruction of the enemies of Israel, who having completed the purpose of vengeance for which they were summoned, and, like the Assyrians under the walls of Jerusalem, having exalted themselves against the Lord, perish miserably under the stroke of His power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea</span>. This verse promises the destruction of the devastator. The prophet here specifies the means by which the Eternal was going to restore the blessings of harvest. The order of sequence is inverted - the effect preceding the cause; thus, re. storation of prosperity and plenty goes before, and the cause thereof, being relief from invasion and loss, follows after. Nor is there anything singular in this, as men are more alive to recovery from a distressful state of any kind than to the remedy which effects it. The "army" of this verse we still hold to be the tribes of locusts, which, like an invading army, with its numerous regimental divisions, had overrun the land, scattering dismay and distress wherever it advanced; yet from this very verse, and the expression "northern" in particular, it has been argued that it cannot refer to locusts, but to human invaders symbolized by locusts and the havoc wrought by them. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The north is not the native land of locusts; it is rather the south - the Arabian, Lybian, or Egyptian desert. But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "northern" may denote the quarter from which the locusts appeared to the prophet in vision to enter the land; or, driven upward by a south wind which regularly blows, as we are informed, in those regions during spring, and then to the north of Palestine by an east wind which blows with similar regularity in summer, and again into and ultimately out of Palestine by the north wind blowing in the autumn. "In this case," says a writer in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "the northern plague would have been a natural expression for an inhabitant of Jerusalem to use in speaking of the locusts; as natural as it would be for a Londoner to speak of a pestilence that had commenced its ravages in Great Britain at Edinburgh, as coming to him from the north, though it were originally imported from France or Spain." The word <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> may symbolically denote "calamitous," according to the explanation of some, since calamity is so frequently represented as coming from the north, so that the north is more or less identified with diasaster; thus we read in <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>, "I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction." It may, however, be safely admitted that, by the locust, the northern or Assyrian enemies of Judah, who advanced from the north as the most accessible quarter for attack, are in a subsidiary sense represented. The expulsion of these enemies brings relief; they are driven into a parched, and so desert and desolate, land; "and there," as Kimchi observes, "they shall die because they shall find nothing to eat." That land may be either the Idumaean desert south of Judah or Arabia Deserta. Thus the main body of the great locust-army perishes in the southern desert; while the van of the army is driven into the Dead Sea, and the rear of it into the Mediterranean Sea. Or, more literally, the face of this locust-host was towards the east, or front sea, that is, as already intimated, the Dead Sea eastward; his hinder part toward the west, or hinder sea, that is, the Mediterranean westward. Thus they were driven in every other direction than that by which they came, namely, south, east, and west. In marking the quarters of the world, the Jews faced the east, so that the west was behind them, the south on their right hand, and the north on their left. We have thus a most vivid picture of the speedy and total destruction of the locusts. After expulsion, no danger was to be apprehended from them, for, blown into the sea or desert, they perished at once and for ever. The terms employed are very graphic; thus, <span class="accented">me'alekem</span> is much more than <span class="accented">mikkem</span> would be, and imply that a heavy burden was lifted <span class="accented">from upon</span>, or up off the face of a desolated land, and the heart of a distressed people. <span class="cmt_word">And his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things;</span> margin, <span class="accented">magnified to do.</span> The stench emitted from the putrefying bodies of those locusts would be sickening and stifling - sufficient to occasion a pestilence. Many testimonies from travellers and others prove the reality of both circumstances - the ill savour and its pestiferous nature. Several expressions in this verse are applicable enough to an army, as in the last clause, where he is said to do great things, or literally, "magnified to do," that is, magnified himself in his doings; it may, however, apply equally well to the great destruction by the locust-army. There is no doubt the superadded notion of haughtiness along with that of great doings. It really means that, as an instrument of God, they had effected a fearfully violent desolation, and this is assigned as a reason for the total destruction of those locusts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
