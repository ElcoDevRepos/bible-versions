The priests, as spiritual leaders, are called to express deep sorrow and repentance. This call to lamentation reflects the gravity of the situation, likely a severe locust plague or drought, which is seen as a divine judgment. The priests' role was to intercede for the people, and their mourning signifies a communal call to repentance. This practice is seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>, where the people of Nineveh, including the king, put on sackcloth in response to Jonah's warning.<p><b>wail, O ministers of the altar.</b><br>The ministers of the altar, or Levites, were responsible for the temple services and sacrifices. Their wailing indicates the disruption of these services due to the lack of offerings, a direct result of the agricultural devastation. This disruption symbolizes a break in the covenant relationship between God and His people, as sacrifices were central to worship and atonement. The call to wail underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for divine intervention. This theme of lamentation is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>, where the people are urged to cry out to the Lord in their distress.<p><b>Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God,</b><br>Spending the night in sackcloth suggests an extended period of mourning and prayer, emphasizing the urgency and seriousness of the crisis. The phrase "ministers of my God" highlights the personal relationship between the priests and God, reinforcing their duty to lead the people in repentance. This nocturnal vigil can be seen as a form of intercessory prayer, seeking God's mercy and restoration. The practice of night vigils is seen in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/psalms/134.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>, where the servants of the Lord are called to bless the Lord by night.<p><b>because the grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.</b><br>The grain and drink offerings were essential components of the daily sacrifices in the temple, symbolizing the people's devotion and dependence on God. Their absence indicates a severe agricultural crisis, likely due to a locust plague or drought, which has cut off the means to sustain these offerings. This withholding of offerings signifies a disruption in worship and a breach in the covenant relationship. The situation calls for urgent repentance and a return to God, as seen in similar contexts like <a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9-11</a>, where the lack of offerings is linked to the people's neglect of God's house.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/ministers_of_the_altar.htm">Ministers of the Altar</a></b><br>Those who serve at the altar, assisting in the offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_god.htm">House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sackcloth.htm">Sackcloth</a></b><br>A coarse material worn as a sign of mourning and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The wearing of sackcloth symbolizes a deep, heartfelt repentance.

The invitation, or rather exhortation, here is to something more than lamentation and mourning; for, however natural in the circumstances, affliction itself could not avert or remove the calamity. They are urged, therefore, to repentance as well as lamentation. They were to assume the outward signs of the inward grace: they were to gird themselves with sackcloth, the outward symbol of their inward sorrow; next they were to enter the temple or house of God; they were to spend the night there in the attitude and garb of mourners; night and day they were to bewail their sins with humble, penitent, and contrite hearts. The priests are the persons first addressed, and that not only because, in discharge of their priestly functions as ministers of Jehovah and ministering at the altar, they had been specially touched by the present distress; but also because of their official position they were to present an example to the people whose leaders they were and on whose behalf they ministered (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>, "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"). Kimchi gives a correct exposition of this verse: "<span class="accented">Gird</span>, that is to say, gird on sackcloth, and he explains afterwards, pass the night in sackcloth, because even by night ye shall not remove the sackcloth from off you; perhaps Jehovah will have mercy upon you. And he says, 'ministers of the altar,' and adds, 'ministers of my God,' because the ministry was as the altar to God; and he connects the ministry to God - to the altar, as wherein they minister to Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God</span>. This is the reason assigned for the urgent call to repentance; and it is much the same with that in the beginning of the ninth verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Put on [sackcloth]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;i&#7713;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2296.htm">Strong's 2296: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gird, gird on, gird oneself</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and lament,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1491;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;sip&#772;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
