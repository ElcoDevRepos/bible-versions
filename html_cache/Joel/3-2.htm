It reflects the sovereignty of God over all nations, emphasizing His control over historical events. This gathering is often interpreted as a precursor to a final judgment, aligning with eschatological themes found in other prophetic books such as <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14-16</a>, where nations are gathered for a climactic confrontation.<p><b>and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.</b><br>The Valley of Jehoshaphat is traditionally understood as a symbolic location for divine judgment. The name "Jehoshaphat" means "Yahweh judges," reinforcing the theme of judgment. While the exact geographical location is debated, it is often associated with the Kidron Valley near Jerusalem. This setting underscores the centrality of Jerusalem in biblical prophecy and God's dealings with the nations, as seen in <a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>.<p><b>There I will enter into judgment against them</b><br>This phrase highlights God's role as the ultimate judge. The judgment is not arbitrary but is based on the nations' actions against God's people. This reflects the biblical principle of divine retribution, where God holds nations accountable for their treatment of Israel, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>.<p><b>concerning My people, My inheritance, Israel,</b><br>Here, God refers to Israel as "My people" and "My inheritance," indicating a special covenant relationship. This covenantal language is rooted in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a> and <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where Israel is chosen as God's treasured possession. The phrase underscores the enduring nature of God's promises to Israel, despite their historical scattering.<p><b>whom they have scattered among the nations</b><br>This scattering refers to the historical exiles and dispersions of the Jewish people, such as the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. It reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience but also sets the stage for God's redemptive plan. The scattering is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>.<p><b>as they divided up My land.</b><br>The division of the land signifies the nations' disregard for God's covenant with Israel. The land of Israel is portrayed as God's possession, entrusted to His people. This division is seen as an affront to God's sovereignty and His promises, echoing the warnings in <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a>.

It was an occasion of great anxiety. A national fast was proclaimed, and after it Jehoshaphat engaged and completely routed the enemy in a valley in the wilderness of Tekoa. (See 2 Chronicles 20) The victory was an occasion of immense exultation, and seems to supply the imagery with which Joel describes the day of the Lord. The name of Jehoshaphat was at some period given to the Kedron Valley, but it is here used rather in its grammatical meaning as the scene of the Divine judgment, the words signifying "the valley where Jehovah judgeth."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2</span> represents pictorially God's passing sentence on the nations that had been hostile to his people, with a general summary of the injuries inflicted on them. <span class="cmt_word">I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat</span>. More than eight centuries before the Christian era King Jehoshaphat had gained a splendid victory over the allied army of the neighbouring peoples - Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites - who had united their forces against Jerusalem. The king had been assured of this victory by the prophecy of Jahaziel. Songs of praise had preceded the battle, and songs of thanksgiving had succeeded the victory; hence the place was called the valley of Berachah, or blessing. The remembrance of such a remarkable deliverance, not more than half a century before the prophet's time, would make a vivid impression on the mind of the prophet and his people. Accordingly, this splendid piece of past history is interwoven with the prophet's prediction of the future, and forms its groundwork. It is as though he said, "On a memorable occasion and in a well-known valley God was pleased to vouchsafe to his people and prince a glorious victory over the combined forces of their enemies; so at a future period, under the reign of Prince Messiah, God will subdue and destroy the Gentile nations that had oppressed his people." It matters little whether we understand the valley of Jehoshaphat in the literal sense, as perhaps the valley of the Kedron between Jerusalem and Olivet, or in a figurative sense; the representation is equally appropriate, and the imagery equally impressive. "This," says Aben Ezra, "was the war in which the children of Moab and Ammon and Seir combined their force together to a very great multitude, while Jehoshaphat had out of Judah and Benjamin mighty men of valour; and the valley of Jehoshaphat is the valley of Berachah, for Jehoshaphat called its name so." Kimchi gives the following alternative sense: "There shall be the war, and this valley belonged to King Jehoshaphat; perhaps he built there, or made there a work, and it was called after his name, and the valley was near to the city of Jerusalem; or it is called the valley of Jehoshaphat after the name of the judgment, as he said, 'I will plead with them there.'" <span class="cmt_word">And will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations</span>. God would plead, or contend, with the nations, and pass sentence upon them on account of their dispersion of his heritage <span class="accented">- nachalathi</span>, his peculiar people, and their partition of his land, '<span class="accented">artsi</span>, or kingdom. This must be referred to the long subsequent time when Palestine became a Roman province, and its capital levelled with the ground; then the great dispersion of the covenant people among the nations commenced, and continues till the present day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will gather</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qib&#183;ba&#7779;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
