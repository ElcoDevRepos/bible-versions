The call to rejoice in the LORD emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people. Historically, this joy is rooted in the restoration and blessings following a period of judgment or hardship. Theologically, it reflects the biblical theme of joy in God's salvation and provision, as seen in Psalms and the prophetic books. The call to rejoice is a common biblical exhortation, seen in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are encouraged to find joy in the Lord regardless of circumstances.<p><b>for He has given you the autumn rains for your vindication</b><br>The autumn rains, also known as the "early rains," were crucial for the agricultural cycle in Israel, marking the beginning of the planting season. This phrase indicates God's provision and faithfulness in restoring the land's fertility after a period of drought or locust plague, as described earlier in Joel. The term "vindication" suggests a reversal of misfortune and a demonstration of God's justice and mercy. In a broader biblical context, rain is often a symbol of God's blessing and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, where God promises rain in its season as a reward for obedience.<p><b>He sends you showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before</b><br>The mention of both autumn and spring rains highlights the completeness of God's provision, ensuring both the planting and harvesting seasons are successful. The spring rains, or "latter rains," were essential for the maturation of crops. This promise of rain "as before" reassures the people of a return to normalcy and abundance, reflecting God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. In a prophetic sense, the restoration of rain can be seen as a type of spiritual renewal and blessing, foreshadowing the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which is later referenced in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_zion.htm">Children of Zion</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, specifically those residing in Jerusalem, which is often symbolically called Zion.

Their gladness is grounded in God&#8217;s promise of restoration, not in current circumstances (<a href="/joel/2-21.htm">Joel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rejoice in the LORD your God</b><p>&#8226; Rejoicing is centered &#8220;in the LORD,&#8221; not merely in gifts received.

The source of joy remains constant even when outward conditions change.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for He has given you the autumn rains for your vindication</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;autumn rains&#8221; (early rains) fall soon after planting, ensuring seeds germinate&#8212;vital in an agrarian society (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;For your vindication&#8221; means God openly proves His favor. Where famine once broadcast divine displeasure, timely rain now broadcasts divine acceptance (<a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This literal promise also pictures spiritual refreshing. <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> likens God&#8217;s coming to &#8220;the spring rains that water the earth,&#8221; and <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a> speaks of &#8220;times of refreshing&#8221; following repentance.<p>&#8226; The point: God answers repentance with tangible blessing, publicly reversing His people&#8217;s shame (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sends you showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before</b><p>&#8226; Israel depended on two primary rainy seasons:<p>&#8211; Autumn (early) rains right after the Feast of Tabernacles.<p>&#8211; Spring (latter) rains before harvest.<p>God pledges the full rhythm, not a token drizzle (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;As before&#8221; promises normalcy restored.

He validates their repentance by sending the life-giving autumn and spring rains, re-establishing the covenant rhythms they once enjoyed. The passage is a vivid reminder that God controls both the sky above and the seasons of the soul, and that He delights to publicize His favor toward a repentant, rejoicing people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Ye children of Zion</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they were called upon to manifest their rejoicings in the place where the trumpet had been sounded for the proclamation of the fast.<p><span class= "bld">The former rain moderately.</span>--St. Paul adduces the gift of the rain as a witness to the people of Lystra of the existence and beneficence of God, who "gave us rain from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness." The possibility of the interpretation of "the former rain moderately" out of the Hebrew words by a "teacher of righteousness," as in the Vulg. and in our margin, has led to the connection of this passage with a prophetic intimation of the advent of the Messiah.<p><span class= "bld">In the first month.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">as at first, as before.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God.</span> They had keenly felt and deeply bewailed the unparalleled catastrophe which had befallen laud and cattle and inhabitants, and also themselves among the number. The sons of Zion are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the capital, in which was the national sanctuary for the worship of Jehovah. Not only are the inhabitants of Jerusalem included, but, as the capital often stood for the whole country, all the inhabitants of Judah are comprehended under the "children of Zion." The ground of their gladness and joy in God is: <span class="cmt_word">For he hath given you the former rain moderately</span> (margin, <span class="accented">a teacher of righteousness</span>, or <span class="accented">for righteousness</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month</span>. Omitting for the present the disputed word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span>, we have the great blessing which was so much needed. The blessing bestowed was twofold - negative in the destruction of the locusts and deliverance from their ravages; and positive in the plentiful rainfall, <span class="accented">geshem</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> great and beneficent fertilizer of the dried-up and desolated land. But this abundant rain is more closely particularized as the early or October rain, <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which, falling at the seed-time in autumn, promoted the germination and growth of the seed just sown; and as the latter, or March rain, <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, which, bestowed in the spring season a short time before harvest, matured the crops. The <span class="accented">geshem</span>, or shower, may be regarded here as the generic name, and of these the two species are the <span class="accented">moreh</span> and <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, from <span class="accented">laqash</span>, to be ripe or late, just explained. The word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span> in the early part of the verse is translated <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "teacher" in the Chaldee and Vulgate, by Jerome, by Abar-banel among the Hebrew commentators, who refers it to Messiah; among modern commentators by Hofman, referring it to Joel himself, by Hengstenberg, who understands it of the ideal teacher or collective body of messengers from God. Keil also renders, "the teacher for righteousness," and applies the expression to the instructions of Moses, the priests, and the prophets, not excluding Messiah himself. He also understands the prophet to speak of both spiritual and material blessings, giving a fuller exposition of the latter in vers. 23-27, and of the former in vers. 28-32 and in the last chapter. The two considerations that seem to have most weight with Keil in inclining him to this exposition arc the presence of the article with <span class="accented">moreh</span>, and the non-physical sense of <span class="accented">litsdaqah</span>; hence Ewald's "rain for righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a sign from God of their being adopted again into righteousness. But weight-stones and scales have <span class="accented">tsedeq</span> attached in the physical sense of correctness, while ethical rightness is only an inference or subordinate notion (see <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>). The translation <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of "rain" is, we think, justly entitled to the preference from the context. Among promises of repairing the damage done by the locusts, it would be obviously out of place to introduce the notion of "a teacher." Of the Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi both understand the word in the sense of rain; the former says, "In my opinion it is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh</span>;" and the latter, "<span class="accented">Hammoreh</span> is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh."</span> So also Calvin, Rosenmuller, Hitzig, and Wunsche. The etymology also is favourable to this view, for both <span class="accented">yoreh</span> and <span class="accented">moreh</span> are from the verb <span class="accented">yorah</span>, to throw (Hiph., cause to throw), throw down as drops, wet, besprinkle, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;</span>, and as the Qal and Hiph. sometimes coincide in meaning, we may safely conclude <span class="accented">moreh</span> synonymous with <span class="accented">yoreh</span>, the meaning of which is unquestionably "rain," specially <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. (<span class="accented">a</span>) Rain in right measure, then, we take to be the true meaning; not (<span class="accented">b</span>) rain according to righteousness, as though God, in accordance with his righteousness, repented of the evil he thought to do unto them, and, in consequence of their forsaking their sins, sent the fertilizing rains. Again, <span class="accented">barishon</span> is rendered by some (<span class="accented">a</span>) as if keba-<span class="accented">rishon</span> were equivalent to "as in the former time;" thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicuti in principio.</span> But we prefer (<span class="accented">b</span>) the rendering, "in the first month;" so the Chaldee, "In the month Nisan, or March." The Hebrew commentators explain it in like manner; thus Rashi, "In the first month - in Nisan;" Aben Ezra, "And the meaning of 'in the first' is in the first month;" Kimchi, "The explanation of the rain that is called <span class="accented">moreb</span>, he sends it down to you in its season, which is <span class="accented">Marchesvan</span> (or October), and he causes to descend to you in like manner the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> (the latter rain) in its season in the first month, which is Nisan." The blessing of the rain was thus greatly enhanced by being sent in the right measure and at the suitable season. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Be glad,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#238;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1523.htm">Strong's 1523: </a> </span><span class="str2">To spin round, rejoice, fear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
