It acknowledges that humans cannot presume upon God's actions or decisions. This echoes other biblical instances where God's mercy is sought, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9</a>, where the Ninevites express hope that God might relent from His anger. It emphasizes the importance of repentance and the understanding that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>He may turn and relent</b><br>The possibility of God relenting is a theme throughout the Old Testament, where God is depicted as responsive to genuine repentance. The Hebrew word for "relent" can also mean to have compassion or to change one's mind, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a> when God relents from bringing disaster upon His people after Moses' intercession. This highlights God's character as both just and merciful, willing to forgive when there is true repentance.<p><b>and leave a blessing behind Him&#8212;</b><br>The idea of God leaving a blessing suggests restoration and provision following judgment. In the context of Joel, this is significant because the land had been devastated by locusts, symbolizing divine judgment. The blessing implies a reversal of fortune, where God restores what was lost. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings spiritual restoration and blessing through His sacrifice.<p><b>grain and drink offerings for the LORD your God.</b><br>These offerings were part of the sacrificial system in ancient Israel, representing dedication and thanksgiving to God. The mention of grain and drink offerings indicates a return to normalcy and worship after a period of judgment. It underscores the importance of worship and gratitude in the life of the believer. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God desiring a relationship with His people, where offerings are a means of expressing devotion and reliance on Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel is the author of the book that bears his name.

Instead of presuming on God, Joel calls the people to hope in His mercy without demanding it.<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes David&#8217;s plea when his child was ill: &#8220;Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-22.htm">2 Samuel 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonah employed the same words to urge repentance in Nineveh: &#8220;Who knows? God may turn and relent&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; These parallels underline a consistent biblical theme: genuine contrition leaves room for God&#8217;s sovereign compassion while acknowledging He is never obligated (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He may turn and relent</b><p>Joel reassures the repentant that God&#8217;s character is not rigid judgment but responsive grace.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah records God&#8217;s own promise: &#8220;If&#8230; that nation turns from its evil, then I will relent of the disaster I had planned&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; After Moses&#8217; intercession, &#8220;the LORD relented from the calamity He had threatened&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>), showing that divine wrath and divine mercy are both real and literal.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel adds, &#8220;If the wicked man turns&#8230; he will surely live&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>).

Repentance aims not merely at personal relief but at renewed devotion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2-8</a> prescribes daily grain and drink offerings, symbolizing gratitude and dependence.<p>&#8226; After exile, Israel prioritized these offerings when the altar was rebuilt (<a href="/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a>), showing that true blessing frees God&#8217;s people to honor Him first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a> moves from uncertain hope to concrete expectation: if the people turn, God may equally turn, exchanging judgment for favor.
