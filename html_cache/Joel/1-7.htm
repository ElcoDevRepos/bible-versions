In this context, the destruction of the grapevine signifies a severe judgment upon the nation. The imagery of laying waste suggests total devastation, indicating that the people have turned away from God, resulting in divine retribution. This aligns with other scriptural references where Israel is depicted as a vineyard, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where God laments over the unfruitfulness of His vineyard.<p><b>and splintered My fig tree.</b><br>The fig tree is another symbol of Israel, often representing prosperity and peace. The splintering of the fig tree suggests a violent and thorough destruction, indicating the severity of the judgment. In the New Testament, Jesus curses a barren fig tree (<a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>), symbolizing the spiritual barrenness of Israel. The fig tree's destruction in Joel underscores the theme of judgment due to unfaithfulness and the need for repentance.<p><b>It has stripped off the bark and thrown it away;</b><br>Stripping off the bark signifies a complete stripping away of protection and vitality, leaving the tree vulnerable and exposed. This can be seen as a metaphor for the removal of God's protection over Israel due to their disobedience. The act of throwing it away suggests a disregard for what was once valuable, highlighting the consequences of turning away from God. This imagery is reminiscent of the stripping away of blessings and protection when the covenant is broken, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>the branches have turned white.</b><br>The branches turning white indicates death and desolation, as the life-giving sap is no longer present. This can symbolize the spiritual death that results from sin and separation from God. The whiteness of the branches may also suggest a form of leprosy, a condition often associated with sin and impurity in biblical times. This imagery serves as a stark warning of the consequences of unrepentant sin, urging the people to return to God for restoration and healing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locust_plague.htm">The Locust Plague</a></b><br>A devastating event symbolizing judgment and destruction, often interpreted as a literal plague or a metaphor for invading armies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine_and_fig_tree.htm">The Vine and Fig Tree</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of Israel's prosperity and spiritual state.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in the verse, expressing His judgment and lament over the destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_vine_and_fig_tree.htm">Symbolism of the Vine and Fig Tree</a></b><br>The vine and fig tree are often used in Scripture to symbolize Israel's spiritual health and prosperity.

God appropriates to Himself this land on which the trouble was, by His providence, to fall, and in wrath remembers mercy. It is "my vine," "my fig-tree," the people of God's own choice, that were afflicted; and the affliction, however fully deserved, was, to speak as a man, painful to the Lord, "who doth not afflict willingly." Yet the devastation was to be complete. God's pleasant vine was doomed, and the fig-tree was to be cut down.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree</span> (margin, <span class="accented">laid my</span> <span class="accented">fig tree for a barking</span>): <span class="cmt_word">he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white</span>. We have here a detailed description of the destruction and devastation caused by this locust-army in its invasion of the land of Judah. The most valuable and most valued production of that land, the vine and fig tree, are ruined. The vine is laid waste, so that the vineyard becomes a wilderness: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "he has barked the fig tree" (so Jerome, "Ficum meam decorticavit"); or rather, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "he has broken the branches." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> denotes a fragment or something broken, branches broken off, and so the LXX., "hath utterly broken (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>);" while <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Aben Ezra explains it, "Like foam on the face of the water, in which there is nothing;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a thing of nought. The locusts, by gnawing, had stripped off the bark, or by their excessive weight had broken off the branches. The next clause, which speaks of <span class="accented">making it clean bare</span>, is explained by the Chaldee of peeling off the bark, but that, according to the first rendering, has been already expressed. It is rather more than this - it is stripping off the leaves and fruits or flowers; the barked or broken branches and twigs of vine and fig tree are then cast away or down to the ground. And all that is left are the whitened branches from which the bark has been stripped off. The casting away or down to the earth may refer to the bark; thus Kimchi: "He removes the bark; and so Jonathan explains, 'He quite removes the bark and casts it away;' and the explanation is that he casts the bark to the earth when he eats the juicy parts between the bark and the wood; or the explanation may be that he eats the rind and casts the vine blossom to the earth, and, lo, it is bared." Some, again, understand it of what is uneatable, and others of the vine itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It has laid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">waste</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;am&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
