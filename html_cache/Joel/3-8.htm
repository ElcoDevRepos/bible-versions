Historically, the people of Judah had experienced invasions and exile, notably by the Babylonians. This prophecy indicates a future time when Judah will have the upper hand. The selling of sons and daughters into slavery was a common practice in ancient times, often as a result of war or debt. This phrase underscores the justice of God, who will repay the nations for their treatment of His people. It also echoes the principle of divine retribution found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, which states, "As you have done, it will be done to you."<p><b>and they will sell them to the Sabeans&#8212;to a distant nation.</b><br>The Sabeans were a people known for their trading prowess, likely located in the region of modern-day Yemen. This reference to a "distant nation" emphasizes the complete removal and dispersion of those who opposed God's people, symbolizing total defeat and humiliation. The Sabeans' involvement highlights the far-reaching consequences of divine judgment, extending beyond immediate neighbors to distant lands. This also serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of ancient trade routes and the widespread impact of God's actions. The mention of a distant nation can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to restore and vindicate His people, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>Indeed, the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This phrase serves as a divine seal of authenticity and certainty. When the LORD speaks, it is a guarantee that His words will come to pass. This assurance is a common theme throughout the Bible, where God's declarations are irrevocable and trustworthy. The phrase underscores the authority and sovereignty of God over all nations and events. It also serves as a reminder to the faithful that God's justice will ultimately prevail, providing hope and encouragement in times of oppression and uncertainty. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires and achieving the purpose for which it was sent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing God's chosen people who are often depicted as recipients of God's promises and judgments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabeans.htm">The Sabeans</a></b><br>A people from a distant land, possibly located in the region of modern-day Yemen, known for their wealth and trade.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and judge over the nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Refers to the children of the nations that have opposed God and His people, symbolizing the consequences of their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_judgment.htm">The Event of Judgment</a></b><br>This verse is part of a larger prophecy concerning the judgment of nations that have mistreated Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is comprehensive and extends to all nations.

He is not merely allowing justice; He is personally overseeing it. Just as Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia sold Hebrew boys and girls, their own offspring will now taste the same loss (<a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). God&#8217;s justice is precise, showing He keeps perfect records of wrongs committed against His people (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the hands of the people of Judah</b><p>Judah, once the victim, becomes God&#8217;s appointed instrument of retribution.

The Philistines were also sold in great numbers by the Grecian conquerors in the time of the Maccabees.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off.</span> The Hebrew expression does not mean "to sell by the hand of," as it is erroneously rendered by some; but "to sell into the hand," that is, to deliver over into the power of the children of Judah. The Sabeans were the inhabitants of Sheba, in Arabia Felix, a people actively engaged in trade, and related to the Pales-tinians in the south, as the Grecians in the north. They were a people as far off (or more so) in an easterly direction as the Greeks of Ionia in a westerly; and so Kimchi, "They were far off from their land more than the Javanites." "As the Tyrians sold Jewish prisoners to the maritime people of the far West, so the Jews should sell Tyrians to traders of the far East." The LXX., mistaking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for the plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, translate the clause, "They shall sell them into <span class="accented">captivity</span> to a far-distant nation." If we are not to understand these predictions, with Hengstenberg, as an application of the general truth that God shall gather again the dispersed of Judah and the captives of Israel, we may find their fulfilment in such events as the following: the defeat of the Philistines by Uzziah, "when he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines;" their defeat also by Hezekiah, when "he smote the Philistines even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchman to the fenced city;" and the temporary subjection of portions of Palestinian and Phoenician territory to the Jews in Maccabean times, together with the siege and destruction of their cities, as narrated by the Jewish historian Josephus and in the First Book of Maccabees. We learn also from Diodorus that thirteen thousand captive Tyrians were sold into slavery after the victory of Alexander the Great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will sell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7733;ar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
