In the context of Joel, the Israelites had been suffering from a devastating locust plague, which was seen as a judgment from God. The people's repentance and turning back to God prompted this divine response. This reflects the biblical principle that God hears and responds to the cries of His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> and <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>.<p><b>Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil:</b><br>Grain, new wine, and oil were staples of the ancient Near Eastern diet and economy, symbolizing sustenance, joy, and prosperity. Their abundance was a sign of God's blessing and favor. In the historical context, these were the very resources that had been destroyed by the locusts, so their restoration signifies a reversal of judgment. This promise also echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, where God promises to provide these essentials if Israel obeys His commandments.<p><b>and by them you will be satisfied:</b><br>Satisfaction here implies not just physical fullness but also a sense of peace and contentment that comes from God's provision. This satisfaction contrasts with the previous state of want and desperation caused by the locust plague. It reflects the biblical theme that true satisfaction comes from God alone, as seen in <a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>.<p><b>I will never again make you a reproach among the nations:</b><br>This promise addresses the shame and humiliation that Israel experienced due to their calamities, which were often interpreted by surrounding nations as a sign of divine disfavor. By removing this reproach, God is restoring Israel's honor and standing among the nations. This assurance is reminiscent of God's covenant promises to Israel, where He pledges to make them a great nation and a blessing to others, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration and vindication of God's people in the eschatological future, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/60-15.htm">Isaiah 60:15</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who responds to the repentance and prayers of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are experiencing a time of distress and have turned back to God in repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain,_new_wine,_and_oil.htm">Grain, New Wine, and Oil</a></b><br>Symbols of prosperity and blessing in the agrarian society of ancient Israel, representing God's provision and abundance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reproach_among_the_nations.htm">Reproach among the Nations</a></b><br>The shame and disgrace that Israel faced due to their disobedience and the resulting judgment, which God promises to remove.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_response_to_repentance.htm">God's Faithfulness in Response to Repentance</a></b><br>When God's people turn back to Him with sincere hearts, He responds with mercy and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_as_a_sign_of_restoration.htm">Provision as a Sign of Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of grain, new wine, and oil signifies not just physical sustenance but also spiritual restoration and favor.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/removal_of_shame_and_reproach.htm">Removal of Shame and Reproach</a></b><br>God&#8217;s promise to remove reproach highlights His desire to restore dignity and honor to His people, reflecting His redemptive nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's ability to provide for their needs, both physical and spiritual, as they walk in obedience.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joel_2_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joel 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joel_2_19_God_s_provision_shown_how.htm">How does Joel 2:19 demonstrate God's provision for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_grain_wine_oil_in_Joel_2_19.htm">What does "grain, new wine, and oil" symbolize in Joel 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_promises_in_need.htm">How can we trust God's promises in times of need, like in Joel 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Joel_2_19_and_God_s_faithfulness_link.htm">How does Joel 2:19 connect with God's faithfulness in other scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Joel_2_19_daily.htm">How can we apply God's assurance in Joel 2:19 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joel_2_19_God_s_provision_faithfulness.htm">How does Joel 2:19 reflect God's provision and faithfulness to His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Joel_2_19_s_promise.htm">What historical context surrounds the promise in Joel 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Joel_2_19_Repentance_restoration_link.htm">How does Joel 2:19 relate to the theme of repentance and restoration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joel_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joel 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'equality_with_god'_mean.htm">Should the oil and wine remain unharmed?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_olive_oil_mean_in_the_bible.htm">What does olive oil symbolize in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_scriptures_guide_emotions.htm">What do Bible verses say about abundance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/keep_oil_and_wine_unharmed.htm">Should the oil and wine remain unharmed?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joel 2:19 Mean</div><b>And the LORD answered His people</b><p>God&#8217;s immediate, personal response highlights His attentiveness to a repentant nation.

The corn and the wine and the oil - the three great temporal blessings, equivalent to food, refreshment, and ornament - which the locusts had destroyed, as we read in ver. 10, God here promises to restore, and to restore not merely to the extent that was barely necessary, but in full and abundant measure, so that they would be satisfied therewith. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The verbs of <span class="accented">fulness</span> or <span class="accented">want</span>, <span class="accented">clothing</span> and <span class="accented">unclothing</span>, <span class="accented">going</span> or <span class="accented">coming</span> and <span class="accented">dwelling</span>, govern an accusative; hence <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;</span> has the accusative here; sometimes it is constructed with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There are two constructions of a participle with a pronoun as subject - that in which the pronoun is written in its separate form in immediate connection with the participle, and that in which it is appended as a suffix. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="accented">dagan</span> from <span class="accented">dagah</span>, to multiply; <span class="accented">yitshar</span> from <span class="accented">tsahar</span>, to shine; and <span class="accented">tirosh</span> from <span class="accented">yarash</span>, to take possession of the brain, have each the article prefixed, to emphasize the products restored by the Divine mercy.
