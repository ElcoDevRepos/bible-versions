In the biblical context, this imagery is often used to describe the unstoppable force of God's judgment. The "mighty men" can be seen as a metaphor for the locusts described earlier in Joel, symbolizing an overwhelming invasion. Historically, the Assyrian and Babylonian armies were known for their might and discipline, which could serve as a backdrop for this imagery. This phrase also connects to the spiritual warfare theme found in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to be strong in the Lord.<p><b>they scale the walls like men of war.</b><br>The act of scaling walls signifies a strategic and aggressive military tactic, emphasizing the invaders' skill and determination. In ancient warfare, walls were a city's primary defense, and scaling them indicated a breach of security. This imagery can be linked to the fall of Jerusalem and other cities in the Old Testament, where invading armies overcame defenses. Spiritually, it can represent the relentless nature of sin or judgment that penetrates human defenses. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who overcomes all barriers to establish His kingdom.<p><b>Each one marches in formation,</b><br>This phrase highlights the order and discipline of the invading force. The precision of their movement suggests a well-organized and unified effort, reflecting the sovereignty and control of God over the events. In a broader biblical context, this can be compared to the unity and order within the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>. The imagery of marching in formation also points to the prophetic fulfillment of God's plans, where every event unfolds according to His divine purpose.<p><b>not swerving from the course.</b><br>The unwavering advance of the army signifies determination and focus. This can be seen as a representation of God's unchangeable will and the certainty of His judgment. In a spiritual sense, it calls believers to remain steadfast in their faith, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, where Christians are urged to run the race with perseverance. The phrase also reflects the prophetic assurance that God's purposes will be accomplished, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word does not return void but achieves what He desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel is the author of the book that bears his name.

They appear on the mountains which environ the city, they mount the walls, they rush through the streets, they enter the houses, they are in possession of Jerusalem. Dr. Thomson (<span class= "ital">The Land and the Book,</span> p. 416) describes the movements of a locust army in the following terms:--"Their number was astounding; the whole face of the mountain was black with them. On they came, like a living deluge. We dug trenches, and kindled fires, and beat and burned to death heaps upon heaps; but the effort was utterly useless. Wave after wave rolled up the mountain-side, and poured over rocks, walls, ditches, hedges--those behind covering up and bridging over the masses already killed."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The prophet, having mentioned the consternation and terror occasioned by the approach of locusts, proceeds to compare them to an army well equipped and overcoming all impediments. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall run like mighty men</span>. This either refers to their extreme nimbleness or rapidity of motion (compare the Homeric <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3ba;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and the like), or describes their running to an assault with intrepid valour and unwearied vigour. <span class="cmt_word">They shall climb the wall like men of war</span>. This marks the success of their assault; they scale the walls and make good their attack. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks</span>. Their march is as irresistible as it is orderly. In their onward march each pursues his way, allowing no obstacle to arrest or retard his course; while in a collective body they proceed and maintain their serried ranks unbroken. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is probably cognate with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;</span>, to twist, and thus to turn aside. Thus the LXX.: "They shall not turn aside their tracks;" so also the Syriac and Jerome translate it; but the Chaldee compares it with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d8;</span>, a pledge, and, as the deposit is detained till the pledge is redeemed, takes in the meaning of delay. Rosenmuller explains it in the sense of change or exchange, from the Qal, signifying "to receive on loan," and the Hiph., "to give on loan." Otherwise it is to "interweave" (equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;</span>), "change." The sense of the whole is their not diverging to either side, nor straggling out of rank. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They charge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1510;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;ru&#183;&#7779;&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124;
