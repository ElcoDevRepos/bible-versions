Darkness and gloom are often used in the Bible to describe the Day of the Lord, a time when God intervenes in human history to execute judgment (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). The imagery of darkness can also symbolize spiritual blindness and the absence of God's favor. In the context of Joel, it may refer to the locust plague that devastated the land, serving as a precursor to a more significant judgment.<p><b>a day of clouds and blackness</b><br>Clouds and blackness further emphasize the severity and ominous nature of the coming judgment. In biblical literature, clouds often accompany the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a> when God descends on Mount Sinai. The blackness suggests an overwhelming and inescapable disaster, reinforcing the seriousness of the prophetic warning. This imagery is consistent with apocalyptic literature, which uses dramatic natural phenomena to convey divine intervention.<p><b>Like the dawn overspreading the mountains</b><br>This simile illustrates the sudden and all-encompassing nature of the approaching army. Just as dawn rapidly spreads light across the mountains, the army will swiftly cover the land. The imagery suggests inevitability and thoroughness, indicating that the judgment will be complete and unavoidable. The dawn also contrasts with the darkness mentioned earlier, highlighting the transition from one state to another.<p><b>a great and strong army appears</b><br>The army is described as formidable and powerful, symbolizing the instrument of God's judgment. In the immediate context, this could refer to the locusts, which are depicted as an invading force in <a href="/joel/1.htm">Joel 1</a>. However, it also foreshadows future invasions by foreign powers, such as the Assyrians or Babylonians. Theologically, this army represents God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use them to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>such as never was of old, nor will ever be in ages to come</b><br>This hyperbolic language emphasizes the unprecedented nature of the coming judgment. It echoes similar expressions found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, which describe unparalleled times of distress. The phrase underscores the seriousness of the situation and serves as a call to repentance. It also points to the eschatological Day of the Lord, when ultimate judgment and restoration will occur.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_the_lord.htm">Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A significant event in biblical prophecy, often associated with judgment and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_and_strong_army.htm">Great and Strong Army</a></b><br>Symbolic of the impending judgment and the power of God's intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Often symbolic in scripture, representing stability, permanence, and sometimes the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_judgment.htm">Understanding Divine Judgment</a></b><br><a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the reality of His judgment.

Scripture often links darkness with divine visitation and accountability&#8212;<a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a> calls &#8220;the great day of the LORD&#8230; a day of darkness and gloom,&#8221; and <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18&#8211;20</a> warns that to long for that day while unrepentant is to invite terror, not relief. Here, the gloom is literal (ash-filled skies from locusts or invading armies) and figurative (the despair that comes from sin exposed). God is not capricious; <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a> shows Him using darkness in Egypt to highlight His power and provoke repentance. Joel invites the reader to see both the physical and moral weight of the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A day of clouds and blackness</b><p>The picture intensifies: clouds pile up until light is choked out. <a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a> speaks of &#8220;darkness covering the earth,&#8221; yet also hints at hope for those who belong to the LORD. In Joel, the clouds symbolize unstoppable calamity&#8212;whether a literal swarm of locusts (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>) blotting the sun or a vast human army driving smoke and dust skyward (<a href="/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15</a>). Either way, creation itself becomes the canvas on which God&#8217;s holiness is displayed. Like the pillar of cloud that both guided Israel and blocked Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19&#8211;20</a>), these clouds both protect the repentant and confront the rebellious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the dawn overspreading the mountains</b><p>Suddenly the metaphor shifts: darkness gives way to an image of sunrise rolling over ridgelines. Just as dawn moves swiftly and irresistibly, so too does the approaching force. <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> describes the sun racing &#8220;like a bridegroom&#8221; across the sky; here, the advancing front is just as sure, but instead of bringing warmth, it brings reckoning. The contrast heightens urgency&#8212;morning ordinarily brings relief, yet this &#8220;dawn&#8221; heralds devastation for the unprepared (cf. <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A great and strong army appears</b><p>Whether the horde is locusts (described militarily in <a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4&#8211;5</a>) or human soldiers backed by God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>), their might is unquestionable. <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> already called an earlier wave &#8220;a nation, powerful and without number.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7&#8211;9</a> echoes the same imagery: chariot-like locusts with terrifying advance. The message is clear&#8212;no human defense can stand when the LORD marshals His forces. Yet embedded in the passage is the assurance that this army operates under divine command, meaning repentance can still alter the outcome (<a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such as never was of old, nor will ever be in ages to come</b><p>The scale is unprecedented. <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a> labels the coming &#8220;time of Jacob&#8217;s trouble&#8221; as unmatched, and <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> says a future distress will surpass every earlier ordeal. Jesus cites those texts in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, describing tribulation unequaled in history. Joel&#8217;s wording places his prophecy within that same eschatological framework: God&#8217;s final judgments eclipse all prior examples. The verse underscores the literal seriousness of sin and the literal certainty of God&#8217;s climactic intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> layers vivid images&#8212;deep darkness, impenetrable clouds, a dawn-like surge, an invincible army, an unprecedented crisis&#8212;to drive home one truth: when the LORD moves in judgment, the event is comprehensive, unstoppable, and historically unmatched. Every metaphor underscores His holiness and the urgency of repentance, while cross-references throughout Scripture confirm that this is part of a consistent, literal pattern in God&#8217;s dealings with humanity. For those who humble themselves, the same God who commands the army also opens a path to mercy; for the unrepentant, the day remains one of darkness and gloom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The morning spread upon the mountains.--</span>The Hebrew word here used for morning is derived from a verb, <span class= "ital">Shachar,</span> which has for one meaning "to be or become black," for the second "to break forth" as light. From this latter signification is derived the word for morning--dawn; from the former comes the word "blackness," which gives the name <span class= "ital">Sihor</span> to the Nile (<a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm" title="And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.">Isaiah 23:3</a>). It seems accordingly more in harmony with the present context to take the sense of the word in its reference to blackness, and to understand it as indicating a thick, dark, rolling cloud settled upon the mountain top. The description following comprehends equally the natural and political locusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A day of darkness and of glooming, a day of clouds and of thick darkness.</span> It was, indeed, a day of Divine judgment, a day of sore distress.
