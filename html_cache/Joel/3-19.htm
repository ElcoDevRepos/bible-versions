In biblical history, Egypt was often seen as a symbol of worldly strength and opposition to God's people, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The desolation of Egypt signifies a reversal of its fortunes and a divine retribution for its past actions against Israel. This prophecy aligns with other biblical passages that predict the downfall of Egypt, such as <a href="/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29-32</a>, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>and Edom a desert wasteland</b><br>Edom, the descendants of Esau, often had a contentious relationship with Israel. The prophecy of Edom becoming a desert wasteland reflects its historical enmity and hostility towards Judah. Edom's judgment is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in Obadiah and <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, where Edom is condemned for its violence and betrayal. The imagery of a desert wasteland underscores the complete and utter devastation that will befall Edom, highlighting the consequences of opposing God's chosen people.<p><b>because of the violence done to the people of Judah</b><br>This phrase identifies the reason for the judgment: the violence inflicted upon Judah. Historically, both Egypt and Edom were involved in conflicts with Judah, often exploiting its vulnerabilities. The violence against Judah is not merely physical but also represents a spiritual and moral transgression against God's covenant people. This echoes the biblical principle that God will avenge His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> and <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where God promises to repay those who harm His people.<p><b>in whose land they shed innocent blood</b><br>The shedding of innocent blood in Judah's land is a grave sin that calls for divine justice. This phrase highlights the severity of the offenses committed by Egypt and Edom, as the land of Judah is sacred, being the inheritance given by God to His people. The concept of innocent blood is significant in the Bible, as it cries out for justice, similar to the blood of Abel in <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>. This underscores the moral and spiritual accountability of nations and individuals before God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>, where shedding innocent blood is listed among the things the Lord hates.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's people.

The memory of the exile in Egypt was always fresh and keen; no retrospect of their past history could leave it out of account. And the national detestation of the false and cruel-hearted Idumaean kinsmen is recalled by Obadiah in his prophecy and touching record; as also in Psalms 137, as rendered in the Prayer Book, "Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem, how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah</span>. The curse of barrenness and utter desolation falls on the enemies of Judah - the nearer and the more remote - because of that very enmity and the violence which was its outcome. The Edomite enemies in the south revolted from Judah in the days of Jehoram; the Edomites compassed him in, and, by thus surrounding him, placed him in extreme peril; and though it is said he smote them, yet his expedition proved unsuccessful, for it is added by the chronicler that "the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day." The Egyptian enemies in the more distant south made a still more formidable attack on the capital city, Jerusalem, under the famous Shishak, in the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam, plundering the palace and temple. What acts of violence were perpetrated in these or other wars unrecorded we know not. A more specific charge follows: <span class="cmt_word">Because they have shed innocent blood in their land</span>. This is understood by some to refer to the blood of captive or fugitive Jews in the lands of their Edomite and Egyptian enemies.
