In the context of Joel, this likely refers to a locust plague, which is used metaphorically to describe an invading army. The "nation" could symbolize the Assyrians or Babylonians, who historically invaded Israel. The use of "My land" emphasizes God's ownership and covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting the severity of the invasion as a divine judgment.<p><b>powerful and without number</b><br>The description of the invaders as "powerful and without number" underscores the overwhelming and unstoppable nature of the threat. This could be a literal description of the locust swarms, which are known for their vast numbers and destructive power. Historically, locust plagues were common in the ancient Near East and could devastate entire regions. Theologically, this phrase emphasizes the totality of God's judgment and the need for repentance.<p><b>its teeth are the teeth of a lion</b><br>The imagery of a lion's teeth conveys the ferocity and destructiveness of the invaders. Lions were known in the ancient world for their strength and ability to tear apart their prey. This metaphor suggests that the invaders will leave nothing behind, consuming everything in their path. In biblical literature, lions often symbolize powerful enemies or divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>).<p><b>and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness</b><br>The mention of a lioness adds to the imagery of predatory power, as lionesses are known for their hunting prowess. This further emphasizes the thoroughness and inevitability of the destruction. In the cultural context, the lioness was often seen as even more dangerous than the male lion due to her role in hunting. This phrase reinforces the idea of an unstoppable force, echoing the themes of judgment and the need for Israel to turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invading_nation.htm">The Invading Nation</a></b><br>Symbolically described as a powerful and innumerable force, often interpreted as a locust plague or an invading army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Judah, which is experiencing devastation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lion_and_lioness_imagery.htm">Lion and Lioness Imagery</a></b><br>Symbolizes the destructive power and ferocity of the invaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and can manifest in various forms, such as natural disasters or foreign invasions.

The land is &#8220;My land,&#8221; reminding Judah that every field, vine, and household ultimately belongs to the LORD (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when God sent locusts upon Egypt in <a href="/exodus/10-4.htm">Exodus 10:4&#8211;6</a>. There, as here, the plague was a divine judgment aimed at calling people to repentance (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Joel&#8217;s imagery also foreshadows later warnings of an invading army in <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>, showing that the present disaster is both real and a wake-up sign of something worse if hearts remain hard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Powerful and without number</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;powerful and without number&#8221; (<a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>b)<p>&#8226; In the Middle East a single locust swarm can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of insects&#8212;truly &#8220;without number&#8221; to the human eye (<a href="/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;power&#8221; lies in overwhelming scale. <a href="/proverbs/30-27.htm">Proverbs 30:27</a> notes that locusts &#8220;have no king, yet they all advance in formation,&#8221; an organized strength that dwarfs human defenses.<p>&#8226; The same phrase hints ahead to the apocalyptic locusts of <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>, a reminder that unchecked sin invites ever-greater waves of judgment unless people return to the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its teeth are the teeth of a lion</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;its teeth are the teeth of a lion&#8221; (<a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>c)<p>&#8226; Joel stresses the damage: locusts shred crops with mandibles as relentless as a lion&#8217;s bite. What looks harmless from a distance proves devastating up close.<p>&#8226; This comparison echoes <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, where enemies&#8217; teeth are &#8220;spears and arrows.&#8221; It also anticipates <a href="/revelation/9-8.htm">Revelation 9:8</a>, where visionary locusts have &#8220;teeth like lions,&#8221; tying Joel&#8217;s plague to later prophetic pictures of judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a> says, &#8220;The lion has roared&#8212;who will not fear?&#8221; God&#8217;s roar through nature demands Israel&#8217;s attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its fangs are the fangs of a lioness</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness&#8221; (<a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>d)<p>&#8226; A lioness hunts to feed her pride; her fangs signify swift, effective predation. Likewise, the locusts leave nothing behind&#8212;grain, fruit, bark, even hope (<a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5-6</a> shows Samson tearing a lion by the Spirit&#8217;s power; Joel&#8217;s readers would recall that only God can overcome such jaws. The call is clear: seek the LORD, not human solutions.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a> portrays invaders whose &#8220;fangs are like young lions&#8221;; Joel applies that threat to a current calamity, urging immediate repentance before worse arrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> pictures a literal locust plague sent by God as a disciplined, innumerable army that ravages Judah with the crushing force of lions. Every phrase deepens the warning: the land belongs to the LORD, the swarm is irresistibly vast, and its bite is fatal. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to recognize His hand in the disaster, repent, and find mercy before a greater judgment comes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">A nation.</span>--It was not uncommon with Hebrew writers to apply the name people or folk to animals, as, "The ants are a people not strong;" "The conies are but a feeble folk" (<a href="/context/proverbs/30-25.htm" title="The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;">Proverbs 30:25-26</a>); but the word used by Joel is different from that in the Proverbs. He selected a word indicative of <span class= "ital">foreign</span> nations, suggestive of attack, including both the irrational invader and the foreign conqueror. The surpassing strength of the nation is indicated by the extraordinary power of the locust's teeth, compared to that of the lion's jaws. The same comparison is made by St. John (<a href="/revelation/9-8.htm" title="And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.">Revelation 9:8</a>): "Their teeth (the locusts) were as the teeth of lions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number.</span> The loss of the wine and of the sweet juice of the grape would be a source of genuine sorrow to the drinkers of wine; that loss would be occasioned by the destruction of the vines. In this and the following verse the prophet explains the instrumentality by which that destruction would be brought about. The prophet, fully identifying himself with his countrymen, speaking in their name and as their representative, says "my land." Kimchi understands the suffix to "land," like "my vine" and "my fig tree" in the next verse, as referring either to the prophet himself or to the people of the land; while some refer it to Jehovah, the great Proprietor, who had given the land to his people for their inheritance while they observed his covenant and obeyed his commandments. The locusts ore called a <span class="accented">nation</span>, just as the "ants are a people not strong," and the "conies are" said to be "but a feeble folk." Kimchi lays that "every collection of living things is called a nation (<span class="accented">qoy</span>); accordingly the prophet applies 'nation' to the locust." Nor deem the weed "nation" thus applied support the allegorical sense any more than the Homeric - <p><span class="accented">"Even as go the swarms</span> [<span class="implied">literally nations</span>]<br /><span class="accented">of closely thronging bees."</span> This army of locusts is characterized by the two qualities of strength and number. The preterite <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, though past, really refers to the future, to express the certain occurrence of what is predicted; so with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> in the following verse, of which Kimchi says, "The past is in place of the future;" and Aben Ezra more fully, "A thing that is decreed to take place is spoken of in the past." This army has peculiar weapons, yet nothing the less powerful. <span class="cmt_word">Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion</span>; or, <span class="accented">lioness.</span> Different descriptive terms are applied to lions - the lion's whelp is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>; the young lion, which, though young, is no longer a whelp, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>; also the lion, from its <span class="accented">hoarseness</span> at a certain age, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;</span>; the lion, from its cry, is called by onomatopoeia, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>; the lion, from its <span class="accented">strength</span>, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>; while the common name of a lion, derived probably from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to pluck or tear, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>. Having compared the invading locusts to an army powerful and countless, the prophet proceeds to speak of the weapons wielded by these warlike and hostile invaders. They are their teeth. While the common name for locust respects their multitude, the other names are of the nature of epithets, and all, as we have seen, derived from the vigour and voracity with which they use their teeth. Those teeth, so destructive, are compared to those of a lion and the molars or grinders of a great, stout, old lion or lioness, for the word has been translated in each of these ways. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a nation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1471.htm">Strong's 1471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foreign nation, a Gentile, a troop of animals, a flight of locusts</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has invaded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My land,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
