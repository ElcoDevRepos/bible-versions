In the Greco-Roman world, athletic competitions were well-known, and the imagery of running a race would resonate with the audience. Paul commends the Galatians for their initial enthusiasm and progress in the Christian faith. This reflects the early days of their conversion when they embraced the gospel with zeal and commitment. The metaphor suggests discipline, focus, and perseverance, qualities essential for a successful spiritual life. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, where believers are encouraged to run with endurance.<p><b>Who has obstructed you</b><br>The term "obstructed" implies a hindrance or interference in their spiritual progress. Paul is addressing the influence of false teachers, likely Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision, to be true Christians. This obstruction is not merely a distraction but a significant deviation from the path of faith. The Galatians' spiritual race is being disrupted by teachings that contradict the gospel of grace. This reflects the broader conflict in the early church regarding the role of the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>from obeying the truth?</b><br>"Obeying the truth" refers to living in accordance with the gospel message, which emphasizes faith in Jesus Christ apart from the works of the law. The truth here is the core message of salvation by grace through faith, as outlined in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. The Galatians are being led away from this truth by teachings that add legalistic requirements to the gospel. This phrase underscores the importance of doctrinal purity and the dangers of false teachings. It also highlights the necessity of obedience as a response to the truth of the gospel, aligning with Jesus' words in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in the region of Galatia.

What sudden intruder has stopped your path and led you astray? Certainly it is not God, to whom you owe your calling, that has persuaded you to such a course. You tell me that not many have fallen away. But those few are enough to infect the whole. Not that I wish to implicate all in the sin of some. Most of you I can trust to be true to me. The author of your troubles, whoever he is, shall not escape. God shall judge him. Do you turn round on me and say that I, too, have preached circumcision? The persecutions that I have to undergo from the Jews are proof that I preach it no longer. If I do preach circumcision then the other stumbling-blocks in the way of my teaching are removed. I have no need to lay stress upon a crucified Messiah. The advocates of circumcision may carry their self-mutilation a step further if they please.<p>This section is very abrupt in style. The thought bounds from subject to subject, not stopping to insert links of connection.

In ver. 13 he at length takes up a line of thought which he is able to follow on with fulness and fluency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye did run well</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">full well ye were running.</span> "To run" is a favourite figure with St. Paul, drawn from the foot-races of the Isthmian Games or other public games common throughout the Roman empire, and applied above (<a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>) to his own course of apostolic service, but here, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>; and <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>, in a wider reference to the course of general Christian obedience. In vers. 5, 6 the apostle has indicated the proper character of a Christian believer's life, as one which is animated by a faith energizing through love, and by the anticipation of attaining hereafter the awards to be rendered to the justified. Compare the general strain of thought, strikingly similar to that in the present context, pursued in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-15</a>. Obviously, one Important element in the comparison is the Christian's forward advance in self-improvement, as well as his continuing prosecution of work for Christ's cause. These characteristics had, and not long before, marked the manner of life of the Galatian Christians. Upon the recurrence of this recollection, here again, as in <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-16</a>, the apostle bewails the change that had taken place. They <span class="accented">had</span> been so full of joy and of love in believing (<a href="/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>). But now an incipient relinquishment of their hope in Christ had left them cheerless, and, in consequence, ready to look abroad in quest of other grounds of assured confidence; while also the thence ensuing conflicts of controversy and faction had marred their once happy mutual concord (ver. 15). The form of Christian life which the Galatian Churchmen had in those days presented to view was apparently similar to that which at an earlier date he had described as marking the Thessalonian Church (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), and at a later time applauds in the Colossian (<a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4-6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who aid hinder you</span>; or, <span class="accented">who did drive you back</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>]). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus would mean, as in the margin of our English Bibles, "Who has driven [or, beaten, struck] you back," and would be illustrated by the use of the verb in Wisd. 18:23, "Standing between, he beat back the wrath," as Aaron did. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> is the reading of all recent editors. The precise meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> does not seem to be, as some suppose, "to stop," but rather "to hamper, shackle, impede." It occurs <a href="/acts/24-4.htm">Acts 24:4</a>, "be tedious;" <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, "Satan hindered;" <a href="/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, "hindered." So the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, "That we may cause no hindrance to [clog the success of] the gospel." Possibly this sense is derived from the hindrance caused to the traveller by the road being "cut into" or cut up before he goes over it. But it is more probably connected with the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "worry," as in Demosthenes, 'Olynth.,' it. p. 22, "Worried from time to time by these expeditions up and down." So here, "Who was it that clogged your steps in running your race?" Not positively "arrested your steps:" this disastrous result, it was to be hoped, was not yet brought about; they were only as yet lagging in their course. This interrogation "who" does not so much demand that the evil worker shall be named and brought to light, as express the pity of it, that any one should have been able to work them so much mischief; as in <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>. Nevertheless, the author of the mischief had cause to tremble (see ver. 12, and note). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should not obey the truth?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> [T.

"The truth" directly cites the gospel; that is, the gospel which proclaims righteousness as theirs who believe in Christ apart from works of the ceremonial law; comp. <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>, "That the truth of the gospel might continue with you," the particular phase of the gospel there intended being clearly evinced from the circumstances referred to. "Truth," without the article, denoting "that which is true," cites the same by implication. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, frequently rendered in the Authorized Version by "obey," as <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, properly means to lend a compliant ear to advice or persuasion; "to hearken," as <a href="/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36, 37, 40</a>; <a href="/acts/23-21.htm">Acts 23:21</a>; <a href="/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>. The apostle means that they were turning their ears away from the truth to listen to pernicious counsels or teaching.
