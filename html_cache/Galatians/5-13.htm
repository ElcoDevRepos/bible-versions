The term "brothers" indicates a familial relationship among believers, highlighting unity in Christ. The freedom mentioned is spiritual, referring to liberation from the Mosaic Law's constraints and the bondage of sin. This echoes Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." Historically, the Galatians were being influenced by Judaizers who insisted on adherence to Jewish law for salvation, which Paul refutes by affirming their call to freedom in Christ.<p><b>but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh.</b><br>Paul warns against misusing Christian liberty as a pretext for indulging in sinful desires. The "flesh" here represents the sinful nature, contrasting with the Spirit-led life. This caution aligns with <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>, where Paul asks if grace should lead to continued sin, answering emphatically that it should not. The cultural context of the time included various pagan practices that were contrary to Christian living, and Paul urges believers to avoid reverting to such behaviors. This admonition serves as a reminder that true freedom in Christ involves self-control and moral responsibility.<p><b>Rather, serve one another in love.</b><br>Paul redirects the focus from self-indulgence to selfless service, encapsulating the essence of Christian freedom. The call to "serve" is a call to humility and putting others' needs above one's own, reflecting Jesus' example in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, where He came to serve, not to be served. The phrase "in love" is crucial, as love is the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>) and the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). This service in love is a practical outworking of faith, fostering community and unity within the body of Christ, and is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the early Christian communities in the region of Galatia.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatian_churches.htm">Galatian Churches</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers who were struggling with issues of legalism and Christian liberty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_christ.htm">Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>A central theme in Galatians, emphasizing liberation from the law and sin through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flesh.htm">The Flesh</a></b><br>Refers to the sinful nature and desires that are contrary to the Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/service_in_love.htm">Service in Love</a></b><br>The call to use Christian freedom to serve others selflessly, reflecting Christ's love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_christian_freedom.htm">Understanding Christian Freedom</a></b><br>Christian freedom is not a license to indulge in sinful desires but a call to live a life that honors God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_the_flesh.htm">The Danger of the Flesh</a></b><br>The "flesh" represents our sinful nature, and believers must be vigilant not to let it dominate their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/serving_others_in_love.htm">Serving Others in Love</a></b><br>True freedom in Christ is expressed through loving service to others, reflecting the love of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to overcome the flesh and live a life of love and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>Believers are called to support and hold each other accountable in living out their freedom responsibly.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Galatians_5_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Use_freedom_to_lovingly_serve_others.htm">How can we use our freedom to serve others in love today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Gal_5_13_warn_against.htm">What does "do not use your freedom" warn against in Galatians 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Gal_5_13_to_loving_your_neighbor.htm">How does Galatians 5:13 connect with Jesus' commandment to love your neighbor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_serving_others_fulfill_Christ_s_law.htm">In what ways can serving others fulfill the law of Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_misusing_freedom.htm">How can we guard against using freedom as an opportunity for the flesh?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_is_true_freedom_in_Galatians_5_13.htm">How does Galatians 5:13 define true Christian freedom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_serve_one_another_humbly.htm">What does "serve one another humbly in love" mean in Galatians 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_5_13_vs_self-indulgence.htm">How does Galatians 5:13 challenge the concept of self-indulgence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_galatians_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Galatians 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_descriptive_vs._prescriptive_differ.htm">How do descriptive and prescriptive approaches differ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_being_free_in_christ_mean.htm">What does being free in Christ mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_is_loren_cunningham.htm">Who is Loren Cunningham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_interdependence.htm">What does the Bible say about interdependence?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Galatians 5:13 Mean</div><b>For you, brothers, were called to freedom</b><p>&#8220;Brothers, you were called to freedom&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>). Paul reminds believers that in Christ we have been decisively set free&#8212;free from the curse of the Law (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>), free from bondage to sin (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>), and free to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This freedom is God-given, not self-earned, echoing Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; It is a present reality; Paul speaks in the past tense&#8212;&#8220;were called&#8221;&#8212;underscoring that the call to liberty is already ours (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet it is also a calling, inviting daily choices that reflect our new status (<a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh</b><p>Liberty can be twisted into license, so Paul quickly warns, &#8220;do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;flesh&#8221; refers to our old sin-bent nature. Freedom is never permission to indulge it (<a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul faced teachers who urged law-keeping for salvation; in rejecting that legalism, he also rejects the opposite extreme of self-centered indulgence (Jude 4).<p>&#8226; The freedom Christ gives should never cause another believer to stumble (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; True liberty always bows to the Lordship of Christ, refusing sinful cravings that war against the soul (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rather, serve one another in love</b><p>Paul flips the concept of freedom on its head: real liberty expresses itself through loving service. &#8220;Rather, serve one another in love&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Freedom from self makes room for self-giving. Jesus modeled this: &#8220;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Love moves us to consider others above ourselves (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-5</a>), bear each other&#8217;s burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), and act in practical deeds, not mere words (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;serve&#8221; is literally to become a bond-servant by choice&#8212;echoing Christ who washed His disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; A church marked by loving service showcases the gospel to a watching world (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a> holds three interwoven truths: we are genuinely freed by Christ, we must guard that freedom from fleshly abuse, and we display our liberty best by loving, self-sacrificing service to one another. Freedom in Jesus is not an end in itself; it is the doorway to a life that mirrors His love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13-15) The Judaisers would deserve such a fate; for they are undoing the whole object with which you were called. You were called, not to legal bondage, but to <span class= "ital">freedom.</span> This caution only is needed: Do not make freedom a pretext for self-indulgence. One servitude you may submit to--the service of love. So doing, you will fulfil the Law without being legalists. He who loves his neighbour as himself will need no other rule. On the other hand, dissensions will be fatal, not to one party only, but to all who take part in them.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--This connecting particle supplies the reason for the Apostle's severe treatment of the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">An occasion to the flesh.</span>--Do not, under the name "liberty," give way to sensual excesses. This was the especial danger of the Gentile churches, such as Corinth, from which, as we have seen, the Apostle may have been writing. Galatia, too, was a Gentile church; and though it was for the present subject rather to Judaising influences, the character of the people was fickle, and St. Paul may have thought it well to hint a caution in this direction.<p><span class= "bld">Serve.</span>--There is a stress upon this word. The Apostle had been dissuading the Galatians from submitting to other forms of servitude. This one he will permit them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, brethren, ye have</span> <span class="cmt_word">been called unto liberty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">for ye</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">were called unto</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">freedom.</span> The "for" points back to the closing words of the preceding verse, which implied a settled state of well-being from which those troublers were driving his readers; that happy state (the apostle says) was the very glory and essence of their "calling." This, of course, was that condition of free men described at the end of the foregoing chapter, and summarized in the first verse of this chapter. This is again, even more briefly, recapitulated in the first clause of the present verse. As the summary in the first verse supplied a starting-point for the warnings against the Judaizers which have taken up the foregoing twelve verses, so this new summary furnishes the starting-point for exhortations designed to guard the evangelical doctrine against antinomian perversion, by insisting upon the moral behaviour required of those who enjoy the freedom which Christ gives. These exhortations occupy the remainder of this chapter and a part of the next. "Ye," being what ye are, believers baptized into Christ. The verb "were called" expresses a complete idea, meaning of itself without any adjunct, "called by God to be people of his own" (cf. "calleth," ver. 8, and the passages there cited). The words, "unto," or "for, freedom," supply an adjunct notion; as in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, the clause, "in one hope of your calling," does to the same verb. So again <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>," For God called us, not unto [or, 'for' ] uncleanness, but in sanctification.' 'The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, both in the passage last cited and in the present verse, denotes the condition or understanding upon which God had called them: they were "called" upon the understanding that they should be in a state of liberty. So <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "Created in Christ Jesus unto ['Greek,' for] good works." God calls us in Christ to be free in these three respects: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> free from condemnation and conscience of guiltiness; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> free from pupil-age to a ceremonial institute of positive, carnal ordinances, and from bondage to a letter-Law; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> free, as consciously his children, knit to him by his adopting Spirit, which makes us partakers of his nature. <span class="cmt_word">Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">no freedom which shall be an occasion to the flesh</span>! or, <span class="accented">only</span>, make <span class="accented">not your freedom into an occasion for the flesh.</span> The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, being in the accusative, cannot be taken as simply a resumption of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> immediately before. In his eagerness to at once bar the antinomian's abuse of the gospel, the apostle omits the verb which should account for this accusative; and the result is a sentence which may be taken as grouping with various passages in classical Greek authors, being in fact quite a natural way of speaking in any language; such as in Demosthenes, ' Philippians,' 1. p. 45, "No ten thousand mercenaries for me!

In such cases it simply weakens the vivacity of the style, if we supply any verb. The alternative rendering supplies <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which is in fact found in two uncial manuscripts, F, G, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, proposed by OEcumenius. In the former way of construing we have in thought to supply a second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>: <a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is need as <a href="/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>, etc. The sense of the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, starting-point, is well illustrated by its use, in the military language of Greece, for a "basis of operations" (cf. <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8, 11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). Reflection at once shows us that a "<span class="accented">freedom"</span> which allows a man to obey the behests of his lower nature is only by a false use of the term capable of being grouped with that freedom wherewith Christ makes us free. It adopts out of the latter the single element of emancipation from ceremonial law and letter-Law, and lets go altogether the concomitant notions of spiritual emancipation which are of its very essence. Such an emancipation hands its victim clean over to the thraldom of sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18, 19</a>). St. Peter, in his First Epistle, addressed to a large group of Churches founded by St. Paul, including those of Galatia, has a number of passages which apparently take up sentiments and even expressions found in St. Paul's writings (see <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), as it were, ratifying them; and possibly he has an eye to the present verse when he writes (<a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>), "as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of <span class="accented">wickedness</span>, but as bond-servants of God." "The flesh" is not to have its own way, but is to own the mastery of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">But by love serve one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but through love be in bondage to one another</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let love make you bondservants to one another. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> also means "do acts of bond-service,' as <a href="/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>. This sense is included in the "being in bondage ' here spoken cf. In the present posture of affairs in these Churches, the apostle sees occasion for selecting just here one particular branch of Christian goodness to enforce upon their observance. Presently after (vers. 16-20 he enlarges the field of view; though even there still giving much prominence to the vices of malignity and to the benignant virtues. Just now he has his eye especially on the evils of contentiousness (ver. 15), and upon love as their corrective. We may suppose such evils were now especially rife amongst the Galatians, whose natural character, commonly described as quarrelsome, was apparently evincing itself in connection with the disputes which the teaching and yet more the outward action of the Judaizers were giving rise to. In fact, a loving temper of mind, along with other benefits, is recommended also by this, that it guards Churches from corrupting innovations in doctrine and Church practice; checking our self-will and our obtrusive vanity, it leads us to avoid giving uneasiness to others by thrusting upon them new notions or new modes of conduct, and makes it our ambition to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The pattern set by our Lord (<a href="/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>), both in washing his disciples' feet and indeed in his whole incarnate life (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), was grandly imitated by the apostle himself (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>), who in outward things habitually sacrificed the pride of independence and self-assertion, and the pride of apparent self-consistency, in his devotion to the spiritual welfare of men. He here preaches just what he himself practised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
