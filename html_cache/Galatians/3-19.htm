The law was given to the Israelites at Mount Sinai after their exodus from Egypt. It served as a covenant between God and His people, establishing guidelines for living a life pleasing to God. The law was not intended to provide salvation but to reveal sin and the need for a Savior. This rhetorical question sets the stage for understanding the temporary and preparatory role of the law in God's plan.<p><b>It was added because of transgressions,</b><br>The law was introduced to highlight human sinfulness and the inability to achieve righteousness through human effort. By defining sin explicitly, the law made people aware of their moral failures and their need for divine grace. This aligns with <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, which states that through the law comes the knowledge of sin. The law acted as a mirror, reflecting humanity's sinful nature and pointing towards the necessity of redemption.<p><b>until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred.</b><br>The "seed" refers to Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. This promise, found in <a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>, foretold that through Abraham's offspring, all nations would be blessed. The law was a temporary measure, serving its purpose until Christ came to fulfill the promise. This highlights the continuity of God's plan from the Abrahamic covenant to the new covenant in Christ, who provides the ultimate solution to sin.<p><b>It was administered through angels by a mediator.</b><br>The involvement of angels in the giving of the law is mentioned in <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a> and <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, suggesting that angels played a role in its transmission. The mediator here is Moses, who acted as the intermediary between God and the Israelites. This contrasts with the direct relationship believers have with God through Christ, who is the sole mediator of the new covenant (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The presence of a mediator in the giving of the law underscores the separation between God and humanity due to sin, a separation that Christ's sacrifice ultimately bridges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgressions.htm">Transgressions</a></b><br>Human sins and violations of God's commands, highlighting the need for the law to reveal sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the promised descendant through whom God's promises are fulfilled.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings who, according to Jewish tradition, were involved in the giving of the law at Mount Sinai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mediator.htm">Mediator</a></b><br>Moses, who acted as the intermediary between God and the Israelites during the giving of the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_the_law.htm">Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The law was given to reveal sin and make humanity aware of their need for a Savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/temporary_nature_of_the_law.htm">Temporary Nature of the Law</a></b><br>The law was a temporary measure until the coming of Christ, the promised Seed, who fulfills the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_mediators.htm">Role of Mediators</a></b><br>Moses served as a mediator for the Old Covenant, but Christ is the mediator of the New Covenant, offering direct access to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/angelic_involvement.htm">Angelic Involvement</a></b><br>The involvement of angels in the giving of the law underscores the law's divine origin and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_fulfilled_in_christ.htm">Promise Fulfilled in Christ</a></b><br>The promise to Abraham finds its fulfillment in Christ, emphasizing the continuity and fulfillment of God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Galatians_3_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Purpose_of_law_in_Galatians_3_19.htm">Why was the law added according to Galatians 3:19, and what purpose does it serve?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_3_19_and_Abraham_s_promise.htm">How does Galatians 3:19 relate to the promise given to Abraham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Angels_role_in_Galatians_3_19_law.htm">What role do angels play in the giving of the law in Galatians 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Gal_3_19_enhance_Jesus_role.htm">How can understanding Galatians 3:19 deepen our appreciation for Jesus' fulfillment of the law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Gal_3_19_on_daily_law_view.htm">How should Galatians 3:19 influence our view of the law in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_the_law_added_in_Gal_3_19.htm">Why was the law added according to Galatians 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_purpose_does_Gal_3_19_give_the_law.htm">How does Galatians 3:19 explain the purpose of the law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Angels_role_in_Galatians_3_19.htm">What role do angels play in Galatians 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_galatians_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Galatians 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_delay_the_law_after_abraham's_covenant.htm">If Galatians 3:19 says the Law was added because of transgressions, why did God wait so long to provide it after Abraham&#8217;s covenant? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_universal_church_of_god.htm">What is the timeline of Paul's life events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_drag_queens.htm">Does the law empower sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_the_law_empower_sin.htm">Does the law empower sin?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Galatians 3:19 Mean</div><b>Why then was the law given?</b><p>Paul poses the very question he knows is on his readers&#8217; minds.

Delivered through angels and a mediator, the law carried authority yet also highlighted humanity&#8217;s separation from God. In Jesus the need for that temporary guardian ends, and the unconditional promise to Abraham opens wide to all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19, 20) If such was not the function of the Law--if it had <span class= "ital">no</span> power to modify the promise--what was its true function? It was a sort of measure of police. Its object was to deal with transgressions. It was also a temporary measure, of force only until it should be superseded by the coming of the Messiah. Unlike the promise, too, it was a contract. It was given by a mediator--that is, a person acting between two parties. Two parties were involved, with rigid conditions binding them both. On the other hand, the promise was given unconditionally by the sole act of God.<p>In stating the true function of the Law, the Apostle brings out its inferiority to the promise in four respects. (1) It dealt with sins, not with holiness; (2) it was temporary and transitory; (3) it was given, not directly, but indirectly, through the double mediation of the angels and of Moses; (4) it was conditional, and not like the promise, unconditional. It depended upon the fallible action of man, and not only upon the infallible word of God.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Wherefore then serveth the law?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">What then is the Law?</span> What is its object or function? If it did not affect the promise, what did it do? The Apostle proceeds to answer this question.<p><span class= "bld">It was added.</span>--It was not a part of the original scheme, but came in as a sort of marginal addition. It was, as it were, a parenthesis in the design of Providence. The direct line of God's dealings with man ran through the promise and its fulfilment. The Law came in by the way.<p><span class= "bld">Because of transgressions.</span>--It has been usual to give to this one of two opposite interpretations, to make it mean (1) to check or put down transgressions; (2) to multiply and increase transgressions, as in <a href="/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>. The expression seems wide enough to cover both ideas.

Here it intimates that the Law was given from a regard to men's sinful actions, with an implied contrast with the covenant of Christ's gospel, which was concerned with men's justification and benediction. The province of the Law is to expose sins, rebuke them, pronounce God's curse upon them, coerce and restrain them by the discipline of a system of outward rites and ceremonies. The office of the Law, as dealing with sinners as continuing sinful, while unable to make them new creatures, is indicated by St. Paul in <a href="/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>, where, after saying, "The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners," he proceeds to add a catalogue of offenders chargeable with the grossest form of criminality; which furnishes a most apt illustration of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("transgressions") which he here uses, and which marks sins in their most wilful and most condemnable character. What was spiritually the outcome of the Law's action upon men's sinful nature, in making their "sin exceeding sinful," the apostle has vividly portrayed in the seventh chapter of the Romans. This last point, however, is probably not even glanced at here; and it is only by straining the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, that some commentators, notably Meyer, find the apostle to be here stating that the Law was added for the behoof of transgressions, as it were in their interest, to increase and intensify them, as in <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, that the trespass might abound. This, however, is not naturally found in the present passage. All that the apostle here states is that the Law merely dealt with sins, having no function in relation to life and righteousness. The article before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the whole class of objects referred to, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This" superadded" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) is not inconsistent with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "nor addeth thereto," of ver. 15; inasmuch as it points to a Divine ordinance, which stood, so to speak, in a different plane from the covenant of grace, and in no way interfered with it. <span class="cmt_word">Till the</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed should come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The form of expression indicates the purpose of him who arranged it all, that the Law should last only so long, and was to come to an end when the seed came. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the promise</span> <span class="cmt_word">was made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">to whom the promise hath been made.</span> The perfect tense of the verb, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 18, points to the still continuing validity of the promise. The "seed" is "Christ;" the historical Christ, indeed, but still viewed collectively as summing up in himself all who should be united to him. <span class="cmt_word">And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">being ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> The verb "ordain" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), being most commonly used for "command," "order," as <a href="/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>, is introduced in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. ver. 20 and <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>; <a href="/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a>), as making more prominent the notion of <span class="accented">imperative</span> action on the part of the Divine Lawgiver. The whole passage is tinctured with the feeling that the giving of the Law, as contrasted with the dispensation of the Messiah, was marked by distance, sternness, alienation. This is the meaning of the mention of "angels" as the medium of communication on the side of Heaven, and of "a mediator" as the selected medium of reception on the side of Israel (compare the contrast between the two dispensations in <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). This representation of the Law as given through angels is unmistakably made again in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the words, "The word spoken through angels" (<a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>), where also it is placed in the same contrast with the gospel as spoken by the Lord Jesus, which here is plainly <span class="accented">implied</span>, if indeed it is not expressly alluded to, in the enigmatic words, "but God is one," in the next verse. This view of the Law as communicated through the medium of angels is distinctly referred to by St. Stephen as the accepted belief of the Jewish theologians before whom he spoke: "Ye who received the Law as the ordinances of angels" (<a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>), where the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, forms a remarkable parallel to the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, now before us. The same view is put forth by Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:05, 3), "We having learned the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our Law through angels from God." Such, then, was incontestably the current belief of the Jewish people, both Christian and non-Christian. The Hebrew theologians directed a great deal of attention upon the doctrine of angels, of which the "boundless genealogies" spoken of by St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; comp. <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>) was certainly one diseased branch. We may without improbability suppose that their exegetical sagacity, not unaided by the Spirit of God promised by him to his people upon their restoration from Captivity, detected the particular fact here indicated in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 19</a>. The countless hosts of his "saints" who attended upon the Lord on that occasion were not surely mere spectators; and to their intervention acting out the volitions of God might be most reasonably ascribed all the physical sights and sounds which gave to the giving of the Law its sensible awfulness (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). "They raised the fire and smoke; they shook and rent the rock; they framed the sound of the trumpet; they effected the articulate voices which conveyed the words of the Law to the ears of the people, and therein proclaimed and published the Law; whereby it became ' the word spoken by angels'" (Owen, 'Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews,' 2:2). <span class="cmt_word">In the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, in or by the hand, is unquestionably a Hebraism, being in the Septuagint the ordinary literal rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">beyad</span>; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/numbers/4-37.htm">Numbers 4:37, 45</a>; which passages likewise show us whom the apostle means to designate as the mediator; in reference to which comp. also <a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, "I stood between (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the Lord and you at that time [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the giving of the Law], to show you the word of the Lord." So Philo ('Vit. Mos.,' 678) speaks of Hoses as acting like a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "mediator and reconciler." Schottgen ('Hor. Hebr.') gives numerous examples from the rabbinical books of this application of the term "mediator "to Moses. This conception of Moses as a mediator seems <span class="accented">implied</span> also in the words, "Mediator of a better covenant" and "Mediator of a new covenant," which we have in <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a> and Hebrews 12:24, with reference to Christ. Evidently the mention of a mediator in the present passage is intended to point to the relations between the Lord and Israel as being those of distance and estrangement. If it be objected that the same inference would be deducible from the description of Christ as "Mediator between God and men," in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, we have it to say, in answer, that Christ, being in his nature both God and man, not only mediates between God and men, having made atonement or reconciliation by his cross, but in his own being unites God and man, abolishing actually that state of mutual alienation which the mediation of Moses by figure implied but could not in reality do away. We, too, were enemies to God before we were reconciled by the death of his Son (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>); but now, being reconciled, we are at one with God in Christ: Christ's life in our nature both guaranteeing and effectuating our continued state of reconciliation with the Father as well as our own spiritual and eternal life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
