This could have been a chronic condition or a temporary affliction that made his presence burdensome. In the ancient world, illness was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure, yet the Galatians did not view it this way. This reflects their initial acceptance of Paul and his message, despite the cultural tendency to associate physical ailments with spiritual or moral failings. The trial here indicates the potential inconvenience or burden his condition might have caused them.<p><b>you did not despise or reject me</b><br>In the Greco-Roman culture, physical ailments could lead to social ostracism. The Galatians' acceptance of Paul despite his illness demonstrates their genuine reception of the Gospel message. The terms "despise" and "reject" suggest a strong cultural pressure to distance oneself from those who were seen as weak or cursed. This acceptance is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, which transcends societal norms and prejudices.<p><b>Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God</b><br>The reference to an "angel of God" highlights the high regard and respect the Galatians had for Paul. In biblical terms, angels are messengers of God, often bringing divine revelation or guidance. This indicates that the Galatians recognized the divine authority and truth in Paul's message. The welcoming of Paul as an angel suggests a deep spiritual insight and openness to God's work through him, aligning with other biblical instances where messengers of God are received with honor (e.g., <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>).<p><b>as if I were Christ Jesus Himself</b><br>This phrase underscores the profound respect and honor the Galatians showed Paul, equating his presence with that of Christ. It reflects the early Christian understanding of the apostolic authority, where apostles were seen as representatives of Christ on earth. This connection to Christ emphasizes the seriousness with which the Galatians initially received the Gospel. It also serves as a reminder of the unity between Christ and His messengers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>, where Jesus states that receiving His disciples is akin to receiving Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians.

"Your trial" brings out the sentiment how greatly his affliction would be likely to indispose his hearers to listen to his message; it "tested" very severely the sincerity and depth of their religious sensibility. <span class="cmt_word">Ye despised not, nor rejected</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">ye scorned not</span>, <span class="accented">nor loathed.</span> The disfigurement on the apostle's person, whatever it was, did not detain their attention; they did not, at least not long, occupy themselves with indulging their feelings of ridicule or disgust; their sense of it got to be soon absorbed in their admiration of the apostle's character and in their delight in the heavenly message which he brought to them. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament found only in St. Luke and St. Paul, means always, not merely "to despise," but to <span class="accented">express</span> contempt for a thing, "to scout" (comp. <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a>; <a href="/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3, 10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a>). Grotius observes of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> that it is a figurative expression drawn from our spitting out of our mouth what greatly offends our taste; quoting Catullus ('Carm.' 50, 'Ad Lic.'): "Precesque nostras, Oramus, ne despuas." Critics have remarked that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is not found elsewhere used thus metaphorically as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is, is probably so applied here by the apostle to produce a kind of alliteration after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: as if it were "Non reprobastis, nec <span class="accented">respuistis."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but as an angel of God received ye me</span>, <span class="accented">as Christ Jesus.</span> Their first feeling of aversation from his personal appearance gave place to emotions of delight in his message of which he seemed as it were the embodiment, and of reverential love and gratitude to himself. His manifest absorption in the glad tidings he brought, and in love to his Lord, irradiating his whole being with <span class="accented">his</span> unbounded benevolence and gladsomeness as the messenger of peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>), was recognized by them with a response of unspeakable enthusiasm.
