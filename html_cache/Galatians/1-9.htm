This repetition underscores the seriousness of the issue at hand, which is the distortion of the gospel. In the context of Galatians, Paul is addressing the influence of Judaizers who were teaching that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law. This repetition also reflects the oral tradition of teaching in the early church, where messages were often repeated for emphasis and clarity.<p><b>If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received:</b><br>The "gospel" refers to the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the salvation of humanity, which Paul had originally preached to the Galatians. The phrase "contrary to the one you received" indicates that the Galatians had initially accepted the true gospel, but were now being swayed by false teachings. This highlights the early church's struggle with maintaining doctrinal purity amidst various interpretations and teachings. The reference to "anyone" includes not only outsiders but also those within the church who might distort the message, emphasizing the universal applicability of this warning.<p><b>let him be under a curse!</b><br>The term "curse" (Greek: anathema) is a strong denunciation, indicating that those who preach a false gospel are to be completely rejected and considered outside the community of faith. This reflects the seriousness with which Paul views the integrity of the gospel message. In the Old Testament, curses were often associated with disobedience to God's covenant (Deuteronomy 27-28), and here Paul uses similar language to stress the gravity of altering the gospel. This curse is not merely a personal wish but a declaration of divine judgment against those who pervert the truth of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, Paul is addressing the churches in Galatia with a strong warning against false teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where Paul established several churches.

In this latter passage, the perfect, "I have said beforehand," points to the time indicated in the words," as when I was present the second time." The resemblance between the two passages, notwithstanding the somewhat different senses in which the verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is used in them, suggests the view that here likewise in the first clause the verb refers to some former occasion on which the apostle was personally present with those he is writing to. The Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), "say before," is sometimes equivalent to "forewarn," as <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-21.htm">Galatians 5:21</a>; and <a href="/2_corinthians/13-2.htm">2 Corinthians 13:2</a> (twice). Sometimes it means "say on a former occasion," as <a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>, and most probably here. The first clause has by some been supposed to refer to the preceding verse. But recent critics generally agree in feeling that both the verb "we have said before" and the adverb "now" suggest the sense of a wider interval of time. The use of the verb in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a> has been cited on behalf of the other view. But even if the somewhat doubtful idea be admitted that <a href="/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a> points back to the twelfth verso of the preceding chapter, it would still fail to furnish an adequate parallel. For not only is it parted from the earlier passage by the number of verses which intervene, but also by a succession of varying moods of feeling and diverse styles of address. Account has to be taken of the change of number between "we have said before" and "I am saying again." The only probable explanation is that the "we" recites the same persons as in the words "we preached" in ver. 8; whereas Paul, as now writing (probably) with his own hand, presents himself individually as reiterating that solemn affirmation. The words, "now also I am saying again," as marking a time contrasted with that earlier one referred to, contemplate the asseveration made in the eighth verso as well as in this. In the "now" the apostle indicates, not so much the moment of his writing, as the just then subsisting juncture of circumstances in Galatia, which called for the renewal of his commination. Its earlier utterance referred to may have occurred either in the second visit to Galatia, mentioned in <a href="/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>, or in the first, mentioned in <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. When taking leave of his disciples on either occasion he may have been led to thus emphatically insist upon the sacred, inviolable character of the gospel, by his observation on the one hand of the fickleness and impressionableness which characterized this people, and on the other by the frequency with which perversions of Christian doctrine were already seen to be infesting the Churches. Compare also the apostle's warning to the Ephesians (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">if any man is preaching unto you a gospel other than that which ye received</span>, <span class="accented">let him be anathema.</span> The verbal variations in these words, as compared with those in ver. 8, are slight. One, however, deserves attention: "If any one <span class="accented">is preaching"</span> compared with "If... an angel <span class="accented">should</span>... <span class="accented">preach."</span> By this change in the form of making the supposition, the denunciation seems to come down out of the region of bare hypothesis to that of, perhaps, present reality. If so, the thunder of the apostle's anathema would be felt by his readers approaching nearer and nearer to the head of seine particular individual among themselves, towards whom their eyes would at once be directed with the feeling that it was, perhaps, <span class="accented">his</span> doom that the apostle was now pronouncing. The construction in the Greek of the verb "preach the gospel" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), with the accusative of the person to whom the message is brought, is found also in <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21</a>. In sense there seems to be no appreciable difference between this construction of the verb and that with the dative as found in the preceding verse and often. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have said before,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#942;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proeir&#275;kamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4302.htm">Strong's 4302: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tell (say) beforehand, forewarn, declare, tell plainly.
