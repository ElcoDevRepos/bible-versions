This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending ethnic and social boundaries. The plea "I beg you" shows Paul's deep concern and urgency, emphasizing the importance of the message he is about to convey. This approach is consistent with Paul's pastoral heart, as seen in other epistles where he appeals to his readers with affection and earnestness (e.g., <a href="/philippians/4.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>).<p><b>become like me</b><br>Paul urges the Galatians to adopt his way of life, which is free from the constraints of the Jewish law. This reflects his teaching that salvation is through faith in Christ alone, not by works of the law (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>). Paul himself, a former Pharisee, had abandoned legalism for the freedom found in Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-9</a>). His life serves as a model of living by faith, emphasizing the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>for I became like you</b><br>Paul reminds the Galatians that he had previously adapted to their Gentile ways, living without the Jewish law to win them to Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-21.htm">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>). This reflects his missionary strategy of becoming "all things to all people" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>) to spread the Gospel effectively. His willingness to identify with the Gentiles underscores the universality of the Gospel and the breaking down of barriers between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>You have done me no wrong</b><br>Paul reassures the Galatians that they have not personally offended him, which suggests that his concern is not about personal grievances but about their spiritual well-being. This statement may also reflect the initial positive reception Paul received when he first preached to them (<a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-14</a>). It highlights the relational aspect of Paul's ministry, where mutual respect and love are foundational, as seen in his other letters (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "brethren, I entreat," comes in here as a breathing forth of intense imploring. And a remarkable instance is here afforded of that abrupt, instantaneous transition in the expression of feeling which is one great characteristic of St. Paul when writing in one of his more passionate moods. Compare for this the flexure of passionate feeling prevailing through the tenth and three following chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. Just before, in this chapter, vers. 8-11, the language has been that of stern upbraiding, and, indeed, as if <span class="accented">de haut en bas</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> from one who from the high level of Israelite pre-eminence was addressing those who quite recently were mere outcast heathens. But here he seems suddenly caught and carried away by a flood of passionate emotion of another kind. The remembrance comes to his soul of his own former sorrows, when he "<span class="accented">suffered</span> the <span class="accented">less</span> of all things," as he so pathetically tells the Philippians (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-14</a>); when in the working out of his own salvation, and that of the Gentiles to whom he had been appointed to minister, he had cut himself off from all that he had once prized, and from all the attachments of kindred and party and nation. A terrible rending had it been for him when he had ceased to be a Jew; his <span class="accented">flesh</span> still quivered at the recollection, though his <span class="accented">spirit</span> rejoiced in Christ Jesus. And now this mood of feeling prompts him to cast himself almost as it were at the feet of these Gentile converts, adjuring them not to turn away from him, not to bereave him of <span class="accented">their</span> fellowship and sympathy. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have not injured me at all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">no wrong have ye done me.</span> This commences a new sentence, which runs on through the next three verses. The apostle is anxious to remove from their minds the apprehension that he was offended with them on the ground of unkindness shown by them towards himself. It was true that he had been writing to them in strong terms of displeasure and indignation; but this was altogether on account of their behaviour towards the gospel, not at all on account of any injury that he had himself to complain cf. He is well aware of the virulent operation of the sentiment expressed by the old maxim, "Odimus quos laesimus;" and is therefore eager and anxious to take its sting out of the mutual relations between himself and them. When the apostle is writing under strong emotion, the connecting links of thought are frequently difficult to discover; and this is the case here. But this seems to be the thread of connection: the Galatian Christians would not be ready to accord him any sympathetic compliance with his entreaty that they would "<span class="accented">be as</span> he <span class="accented">was</span>," if they thought he entertained towards them sentiments of soreness or resentment on personal grounds. There was no reason, he tells them, why they should; they had done him no wrong. There is no reason for supposing that the time of the action referred to in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is identical with that indicated by the aorists of the two next verses. From the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the first time," in ver. 13, it is clear, as critics have generally felt, that there had been a second visit after that one. If so, a disclaimer of offence taken during the first visit would not have obviated the suspicion of offence taken during a later one. The aorist of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> must, therefore, cover the whole period of intercourse. Perhaps thus: whatever wrong you may suspect me of charging you with, be assured I do not charge you with it; there was no personal affront then offered me. In what follows, it is true, he dwells exclusively upon the enthusiastic demonstration which they made of their personal attachment to him when he first visited them; but though the assertion here made is not to its full extent proved good by the particulars given in vers. 13 and 14, and though the enthusiasm of personal kindness there described must, under the circumstances, have very considerably abated; yet, very supposably, nothing may have occurred since then - nothing, for example, during his second visit - which would show that they now disowned those feelings of love and respect. At all events, he refuses to allow that there had. No personal affront had he to complain of; while, on the other hand, their former intense kindness had laid up as it were a fund of responsive affection and gratitude in his bosom which could not be soon exhausted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I beg</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(deomai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1189.htm">Strong's 1189: </a> </span><span class="str2">To want for myself; I want, need; I beg, request, beseech, pray.
