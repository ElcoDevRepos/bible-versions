The "truth of the gospel" refers to the core message that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone, not by adherence to the Law of Moses. This phrase highlights the early church's struggle to integrate Jewish and Gentile believers, emphasizing that the gospel transcends cultural and religious boundaries. The phrase "walking in line" suggests a standard or path that believers are expected to follow, aligning with the teachings of Christ and the apostles.<p><b>I said to Cephas in front of them all</b><br>Cephas, also known as Peter, was a leading apostle and a key figure in the early church. Paul's public confrontation with Peter underscores the seriousness of the issue and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the gospel message. This public rebuke indicates that the matter was not just a personal disagreement but a doctrinal issue affecting the entire community. The setting of this confrontation in Antioch, a major center of early Christianity, highlights the significance of the event in shaping the church's understanding of Jewish and Gentile relations.<p><b>If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew</b><br>Paul points out Peter's inconsistency in behavior. Although Peter was a Jew, he had been living like a Gentile, likely referring to his previous acceptance of Gentile customs and fellowship without adhering strictly to Jewish laws. This reflects the early church's transition from Jewish customs to a new identity in Christ, where cultural and ceremonial laws were no longer binding. Peter's behavior was initially in line with the vision he received in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where God showed him that no person should be considered unclean.<p><b>how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?</b><br>Paul challenges the hypocrisy of expecting Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs when Jewish Christians themselves were not consistently observing them. This question addresses the broader issue of legalism and the imposition of the Mosaic Law on Gentile believers, which was a significant controversy in the early church. The Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> later addressed this issue, affirming that Gentiles were not required to follow the Law of Moses to be part of the Christian community. This phrase underscores the principle that salvation and Christian identity are based on faith in Christ, not cultural or religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of law and grace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cephas.htm">Cephas (Peter)</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' closest disciples, who was confronted by Paul for his behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>- The place where this confrontation took place, a significant early center for Christianity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>- Non-Jewish people who were coming to faith in Christ and were central to the early church's mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>- The ethnic and religious group to which Peter and Paul belonged, with a rich tradition of law and customs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_truth_of_the_gospel.htm">The Truth of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel transcends cultural and religious boundaries, uniting all believers in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confronting_hypocrisy.htm">Confronting Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s confrontation with Peter highlights the importance of addressing hypocrisy within the church to maintain the integrity of the gospel message.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_consistently_with_beliefs.htm">Living Consistently with Beliefs</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in a manner consistent with the truth of the gospel, avoiding actions that contradict their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_correction.htm">Courage in Correction</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s boldness in correcting Peter serves as a model for addressing issues within the church community with love and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The early church's struggle with Jewish and Gentile relations teaches us about the importance of unity amidst diversity in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Galatians_2_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 2:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_2_14_on_Gospel_hypocrisy.htm">How does Galatians 2:14 address hypocrisy in living out the Gospel truth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_means_walk_in_gospel_truth.htm">What does "walk in line with the truth of the gospel" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_2_14_Confronting_hypocrisy_now.htm">How can Galatians 2:14 guide us in confronting hypocrisy today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Galatians_2_14_James_2_14-26.htm">How does Galatians 2:14 connect with James 2:14-26 on faith and works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_actions_with_the_Gospel.htm">What steps can we take to ensure our actions align with the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_confront_Peter_publicly_in_Galatians.htm">Why did Paul confront Peter publicly in Galatians 2:14 instead of privately?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_2_14_on_early_Christian_hypocrisy.htm">How does Galatians 2:14 address the issue of hypocrisy among early Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_2_14_on_Jewish-Gentile_ties.htm">What does Galatians 2:14 reveal about the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_galatians_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Galatians 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_right_hand_of_fellowship.htm">What is the Right Hand of Fellowship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_happened_at_the_antioch_incident.htm">What occurred during the Incident at Antioch?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_muscular_christianity.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 3:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_acts_24_10-15_align_with_paul's_conflicts.htm">In Acts 24:10-15, Paul insists he adheres to Jewish tradition while also preaching resurrection;

When, in the vision at Joppa, unclean animals together with clean were offered to him for food, he had answered, "Not so, Lord; for! have never eaten anything that is common and unclean." This shows that, up to that time, the personal teachings of Christ when he was upon earth had not relieved his mind of the sense that to use certain kinds of meat was for him an unlawful thing. The heavenly rejoinder, "What God hath cleansed, make not thou common," appears to have been understood by him with reference, at least in the first instance, to human beings (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>). There seems to be no doubt that the habit of mind generated by long subjection to the Levitical Law. producing repugnance to Gentiles as habitually using unclean meats, he brought with him when crossing Cornelius's threshold; and that it is quite supposable that, in "eating with Gentiles" while his visit to Cornelius continued, he had had no occasion to break through those barriers of restriction which the Law of itself imposed. But, on the other hand, it is also quite supposable that the answer made to him in the vision had, if not at once, at least later, led him on to the further conviction that God had now made all kinds of meat lawful for a Christian's use, although, when consorting, as in the main he had to do, with Jews, he would still bow to the Levitical restrictions. The Petrine Gospel of St. Mark appears, according to the now by many accepted reading of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the text of Mark 7:19, to have stated that Christ in teaching, "Whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him," had said this, "making all meats clean." There is no question that in St. Paul's own view at that epoch of his ministry when he wrote this Epistle, "nothing," to use his own words, "is unclean of itself" (<a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 25</a>); and we have no reason to doubt that he had "been in the Lord Jesus persuaded" of this long before, - at the very outset probably of his ministry. It is, therefore, not unlikely that this same persuasion of the real indifferency of all kinds of meat had been by Christ instilled into St. Peter's mind as well. But if it were thus in respect to the use of meats, it would be thus also in reference to all other kinds of purely ceremonial restriction. Very shortly before these occurrences at Antioch, St. Peter had at Jerusalem openly and strongly expressed the feeling which he experienced, how intolerably galling were the restraints imposed by the Levitical, not to say by the rabbinical, ceremonialism; "a yoke," he said, "which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear " - language which seems to betoken a mind which had spiritually been set at liberty from the yoke. On the whole, the inference naturally suggested by St. Paul's words, "Thou livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews," commends itself as the true one; namely this - that St. Peter, not on that occasion only, but also on others, when thrown into contact with masses of Gentile converts, was wont to assert his Christian liberty; that, like as St. Paul did, so did he: while, on the one hand, to the Jews he became as a Jew, to them under the Law as under the Law, that he might gain the Jews, gain them that were under the Law, so also, on the other, to them that were without Law he became as without Law, that he might gain also them (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>;). In place of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, why, recent editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, how, which is a more emphatic interrogatory with a tinge of wonderment; as if it were, "How is it possible that?' (so <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>). The verb "Judaize" occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the Gentiles had themselves circumcised and Judaized (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by reason of their fear of the Jews." It is plainly equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;</span>. Compellest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settest thyself to compel. The "compulsion" applied by Cephas was a moral compulsion; he was, in effect, withholding front them Christian fellowship, unless they Judaized. Put into words, his conduct said this: "If you will Judaize, I will hold fellowship with you; if you will not, you are not qualified for full fraternal recognition from me." The withholding of Christian fraternization, short of formal Church excommunication such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a>, is a powerful engine of Christian influence, the use of which is distinctly authorized and even commanded in Scripture (<a href="/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a> 2John 10), and may on occasion be employed by private Christians on their own responsibility. But its use, when not clearly justified, is not only a cruelty to our brethren, but an outrage upon what St. Paul here calls the truth of the gospel. It is at our peril that we grieve, by a cold or unbrotherly bearing towards him, one whom we have reason to believe God has "received" (<a href="/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). If God in Christ owns and loves him as a son, we ought to frankly own and love him as a brother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
