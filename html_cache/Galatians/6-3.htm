In the context of the early church, there was a tendency among some believers to consider themselves superior due to their adherence to the law or their spiritual gifts. This echoes the warning in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The apostle Paul often confronted the issue of pride, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-2</a>, where he reminds believers that knowledge can lead to arrogance if not tempered by love.<p><b>when he is nothing</b><br>Paul emphasizes human frailty and the need for humility. This reflects the biblical teaching that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). The cultural context of the Greco-Roman world often valued status and honor, but Paul subverts this by highlighting the Christian call to humility. Jesus Christ exemplified this humility, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where He emptied Himself and took on the form of a servant.<p><b>he deceives himself</b><br>Self-deception is a recurring theme in Scripture, warning believers against the dangers of being misled by their own hearts. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> states, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" This phrase serves as a caution against the false security that can come from self-reliance or self-righteousness. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a> also warns against merely hearing the word and not doing it, as this leads to self-deception. The call is to live in truth and humility, recognizing one's dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in the region of Galatia.

The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, is well illustrated by the passage cited by critics from Plato's 'Apologia,' p. 41, E: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,... <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "Something" is, by a common meiosis, put for "something considerable" (cf. <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). The especial form of eminence, the claim to which is here referred to, is eminence in spirituality and consistency as a servant of Christ. Possibly the apostle has in his eye certain individuals among the Galatians that he had heard of, who, professing much, were, however, self-complacently bitter and contemptuous towards brethren who had gone wrong in moral conduct or who differed from themselves in the disputes then rife in those Churches. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, "being nothing," is a part of the hypothesis relative to the individual case spoken of, not a statement putting forth the aphorism that no one is really anything. The passage quoted above from Plato shows, that in the latter case we should have had <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. Some men, by the grace of God, <span class="accented">are</span> "something;" but these persons only fancy themselves to be so. Whether any man is really "something" or not is determined by his practical conduct - his "work" as the apostle expresses it in the next verse. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here, though we have the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivers, in <a href="/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>. St. James (<a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>) speaks of a man "deceiving his heart ' in seemingly just the same sense. In both passages it appears to be meant that a man palms off upon his own mind fancies as if they were just apprehensions of real facts; in both also these fancies are but illusive notions of one's own religious character - here, as being "spiritual;" in James, as being "religious" or "devout" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">- the</span> activity of practical benevolence being in both cases wanting; for "<span class="accented">the</span> bridling not his tongue" in ver. 26 is proved by the contrasted behaviour spoken of in the next verse to refer to those <span class="accented">sins</span> of the tongue which are implicitly condemned in vers. 19-21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
