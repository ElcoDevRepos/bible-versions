In the context of Galatians, Paul is addressing the Galatian churches, reminding them of their initial experience of receiving the Spirit. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people. The lavishness of the Spirit indicates a new era of grace, contrasting with the Old Covenant, where the Spirit's presence was more selective and temporary.<p><b>and work miracles among you</b><br>The mention of miracles highlights the tangible evidence of God's power at work within the early Christian community. In the New Testament, miracles often served as signs authenticating the message of the Gospel and the authority of the apostles (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). The Galatians would have witnessed or heard of such miracles, which were not a result of human effort but a demonstration of divine power, reinforcing the message of faith over works.<p><b>because you practice the law,</b><br>Paul challenges the Galatians by questioning the source of their spiritual experiences. The "law" refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes rituals, ceremonies, and moral codes given to Israel. Historically, the law was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. However, Paul argues that adherence to the law is not the basis for receiving the Spirit or experiencing miracles. This reflects the broader New Testament teaching that righteousness and spiritual blessings come through faith in Christ, not legalistic observance (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).<p><b>or because you hear and believe?</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of faith as the means of receiving God's promises. "Hearing" implies receiving the message of the Gospel, which is consistent with <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the word of Christ. "Believe" points to the response of faith, trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ for salvation. This aligns with the example of Abraham, who believed God and was counted as righteous (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>). The emphasis on hearing and believing highlights the New Covenant reality that faith, not works, is the key to experiencing God's grace and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia regarding the issue of faith versus works of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christian communities in the region of Galatia, struggling with the influence of Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who bestows the Holy Spirit and performs miracles among believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, given to believers as a sign of God's presence and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/miracles.htm">Miracles</a></b><br>Supernatural acts performed by God, serving as evidence of His power and presence among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_works.htm">Faith Over Works</a></b><br>The central message of <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a> is that God's Spirit and miraculous works are given through faith, not by observing the law.

Again, God is the doer; believers are beneficiaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you practice the law</b><p>Here Paul dismantles the idea that obedience to Mosaic regulations secures divine favor. <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> already declared, &#8220;A man is not justified by works of the Law.&#8221; Practicing the law never produced the Spirit; Israel received the Law at Sinai, yet the Spirit came at Pentecost (<a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>), long after the Law had proven human inability (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or because you hear and believe?</b><p>&#8220;Hear&#8221; points to receiving the gospel proclamation; &#8220;believe&#8221; speaks of trusting it. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>: &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&#8221; The Galatians received the Spirit &#8220;by hearing with faith&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; No ritual required.<p>&#8226; No merit earned.<p>&#8226; Simply open ears and trusting hearts (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a> sets a clear contrast: God&#8217;s lavish gift of the Spirit and His ongoing miracles flow, not from law-keeping, but from hearing the gospel and believing it. Grace, not works, unlocks the Spirit&#8217;s presence and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The appeal by which the Apostle sought to check the defection of his thoughtless converts was not only an appeal to their past experience, when first they listened to his own preaching, but also to their present experience of facts that they saw actually going on among them. The first great outpouring of the Spirit, both in its miraculous and non-miraculous forms, though checked, had not entirely ceased; and the Galatians might thus see, simply by looking around them, that the channel which God chose for conveying His gifts was not that upon which the Judaisers insisted--the Law--but rather the preaching of faith. Where the faith implanted by the Apostle's preaching still showed signs of vital growth, there the gifts of the Spirit were seen in connection with it; but not amongst the Judaisers and their party.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--This word takes up again the question which had been started in <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>, but brings it down, as it were, to the present time. The opposition between the effects of faith, on the one hand, and works, on the other, was conspicuous when the Galatians were first converted; it is as conspicuous still. The argument is the same, whichever standpoint is assumed.<p><span class= "bld">Ministereth.</span>--The notion contained in this word is not only that of "supply," but of "<span class= "ital">liberal</span> supply." At Athens it was the custom for wealthy citizens to bear the cost of bringing out the chorus--which was practically equivalent to putting a play upon the stage--at the great public feasts. The word translated "ministereth" was the technical term for this. The same word is used in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>. In three out of the four places it is rendered by the same word "minister;" in <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a> it appears in the phrase "<span class= "ital">add</span> to your faith virtue" (rather, <span class= "ital">furnish</span> <span class= "ital">forth in your faith virtue</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "let your faith prompt you to abundant acts of virtue"). "He that ministereth" is, of course, God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); he <span class="accented">then that sup-plieth to you the Spirit and worketh powers in you</span>, or, <span class="accented">miracles among you.</span> The "then" marks the taking up afresh of the topic brought forward in ver. 2, with especial prominence given here to the miraculous manifestations of the Spirit's presence. The argumentative treatment of this topic of the gift of the Spirit was interrupted in vers. 3 and 4 by curt, strongly emotional interrogatories, darted forth upon the apostle's recollecting the animated spirituality which marked those early days of their discipleship. The impassioned desultoriness of his language here, together with its abrupt, stingy wording, is paralleled by <a href="/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10-20</a>. Perhaps these features in the form of the composition were in part occasioned by the circumstance that he was writing this Epistle with his own hand and not through an amanuensis; such manual exertion being, it should seem, unusual with him, and from some cause even laborious and painful: and so from time to time he appears, as it were, laying down the pen, to rest, to quell emotion, to reflect. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, supply, differs probably from the simple form <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> only by indicating profusion in the supply; but this qualification of its meaning is too slight to be representable in translation. Besides <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5, 11</a>, we find it in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>, "He that supplieth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) seed... shall supply (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and multiply your seed for sowing;" <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, "From whom all the body... being supplied;" <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, "As of the strength which God sup-plieth." And with similar application the substantive "supply" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>, "Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;" <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>, "Through every joint of the supply." These passages make it clear that "he that supplieth" is no other than God. And this conclusion is borne out by the comparing of the other clause, "<span class="accented">worketh</span> powers in you," with <a href="/1_corinthians/12-6.htm">1 Corinthians 12:6</a>, "It is the same God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> who worketh all in all" (referring to the charismata) - which passage shows that "<span class="accented">powers</span>' (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are not "<span class="accented">miracles"</span> themselves as in <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a> and Matthew 11:20, and often, but power to work miracles, the plural number pointing to the various forms of its manifestation, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>. The apostle <span class="accented">uses</span> the present participles <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> as describing an agency which the Almighty was continually putting forth among believers in general, including the Galatian Churches themselves<span class="cmt_word">. Doeth he it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>;) <span class="accented">in consequence of works of the Law or of the hearing of faith</span>? With the sparingness of words above noted, the apostle barely jots down, so to speak, the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the interrogative dilemma, without filling in the <span class="accented">form</span> of the question. The suppletion would naturally be that of our version, "doeth he it." The substance of the argument apparently required no more than, as before, the question - Was it in consequence of works of the Law or of the hearing of faith that the Spirit and his wonder-working powers were received? But instead of putting it so, St. Paul interposes the personality of the great God himself as imparting these great gifts, making his sentence thereby the more stately and impressive: it is with God in the might of his working that these corrupters of the gospel have to reckon. The impartation of the Spirit and the charisms evidenced God's complacency in the recipients. On what was that complacency founded? on their earning it by ceremonial performances, or on their simply opening their hearts to receive his love? It was a question which the Galatian Churchmen might, if they would, see the answer to in experiences of their own. Among themselves these powers had appeared, and no doubt were still operative. "Well, then," says the apostle, "look and see: are they not operative in those only of you who had received them upon the mere acceptance of righteousness offered them through faith in Christ simply, without having given any heed to Mosaic ceremonialism? Have any of you received them after taking up with such ceremonialism?" The apostle, it will be observed - and the remark is one of no small importance - makes an appeal to simple matters of fact, founded upon his and their own familiar acquaintance with the facts, and defying contradiction. We may be sure, therefore, that the facts were as he indicates, however small the extent may be to which we, with our imperfect knowledge of the circumstances, are ourselves able to verify his statement. In some degree, however, we can. Besides the striking illustration afforded by what occurred in the house of Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>), we see that such charismata were bestowed, and in some instances, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> at Corinth, in exceeding great profusion, in the train of St. Paul's evangelizing ministrations; and how remote those ministrations were from the inculcation, or even the admission, among Gentile converts of Mosaic ceremonialism we know perfectly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Does} [God]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
