In the context of Galatians, "faith" signifies the faith in Christ that brings justification. The Old Testament era was characterized by adherence to the Mosaic Law, which served as a guardian until the coming of Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). This anticipates the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which speaks of a new covenant.<p><b>we were held in custody under the law</b><br>The law acted as a custodian or guardian, highlighting humanity's sinfulness and need for a savior. The Greek term used here can imply being kept under guard, suggesting a protective yet restrictive role. The law was not intended to provide salvation but to point towards the need for redemption through Christ (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). This reflects the historical context of the Jewish people who were bound by the law's requirements and rituals.<p><b>locked up until faith should be revealed</b><br>This imagery of being "locked up" suggests confinement and the inability to attain freedom or righteousness through the law alone. The "faith" that is revealed is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which offers liberation from the constraints of the law (<a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>). The revelation of faith in Christ marks the transition from the old covenant to the new, fulfilling the law's purpose and opening the way for all, Jew and Gentile alike, to become children of God through faith (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the

The "but" is an-tithetic to the closing clause of ver. 22, from which is taken up afresh the notion of faith, there spoken of as of old destined to become at the proper time the qualifier for the receiving of the promise. "Faith" denotes, not objectively, "the faith," that is, the gospel, as <a href="/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, a sense in which it is seldom used, and which is repelled here by the whole context; but subjectively, the principle of belief in One who gives of mere grace. This, by a bold and surely jubilant figure of speech, is personified as "coming" for men's deliverance, while the "Law" is also personified as the stern custodian under whose charge till then men were detained. Compare the frequent references in the Psalms to "light," "truth," "righteousness," "word," etc., being" sent," "commanded," by the Lord, as in angels, despatched for the help of his saints (<a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">We were kept under the Law, shut up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Revised Text; so, according to Scrivener, L.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, keep carefully guarded, is used with a prominent notion of protection in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; whilst in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>, as here, the more prominent idea is that of preventing egress. Comp. <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>, "The Law wherein we were holden (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>)." So Wisd. 17:16, of Egyptians, in the plague of miraculous darkness, as it were imprisoned, unable to move, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, "Was kept ill ward, having been shut up into the prison which had no iron bars." The reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, although highly witnessed to by uncial manuscripts, appears to be accounted for by the reading in B, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (very probably a clerical blunder for <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), which may have given it vogue. The perfect participle seems alone suitable to the passage, <span class="accented">q.d.</span> shut up for good and all. The present participle would require to be understood of the repression of a constantly repeated endeavour to escape (or, what?). As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the preceding verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> takes the shade of meaning, "shut up as I said." <span class="cmt_word">Unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). "Unto;" with reference to, with an eye to, the coming economy of free grace, to which they were then to be transferred. The same preposition (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) is used in the same manner in the next verse," unto Christ." In the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, we have the same form of sentence as in <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "For the glory which shall hereafter be revealed." In both cases, the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> appears to indicate, not merely that the manifestation was future, but that the future would be sure to bring it; the predetermining purpose of God made it certain. "Revealed:" the principle of faith as accepting a gift bestowed of free grace, though not unknown to the pious of former ages (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>) - for how in any age could one con-scions of sin look for any gift at the hands of the Almighty except thus? - was destined, under the "gospel of the grace of God," to come forth into conspicuous prominence as the one supremely commanding element of religious sentiment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Before</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Pro)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4253.htm">Strong's 4253: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; 'fore', i.e. In front of, prior to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[this]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
