In biblical literature, allegory is often used to reveal hidden meanings. The Apostle Paul uses the story of Hagar and Sarah to illustrate the difference between living under the law and living under grace. This method of teaching was common in Jewish rabbinical tradition, where historical events were used to explain spiritual principles.<p><b>for the women represent two covenants</b><br>The two women, Hagar and Sarah, symbolize two distinct covenants. Hagar represents the Old Covenant, which is based on the Mosaic Law given at Mount Sinai. Sarah represents the New Covenant, which is based on the promise of grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This distinction is crucial in understanding the transition from the law to grace, a central theme in Paul's letters. The concept of covenants is foundational in Scripture, with the Old Covenant focusing on adherence to the law and the New Covenant emphasizing faith and grace.<p><b>One covenant is from Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai is the geographical location where God gave the Law to Moses, establishing the Old Covenant with the Israelites. This covenant required strict adherence to the law and was characterized by a system of sacrifices and rituals. The giving of the law at Sinai is a pivotal event in Jewish history, marking the formal establishment of Israel as God's chosen people. The law served as a tutor to lead people to Christ, highlighting the need for a savior due to humanity's inability to fully keep the law.<p><b>and bears children into slavery</b><br>This phrase refers to the spiritual bondage that results from trying to achieve righteousness through the law. Just as Hagar's son, Ishmael, was born into slavery, those who rely on the law for salvation are bound by its demands and penalties. The law reveals sin but does not provide the power to overcome it, leading to a cycle of guilt and condemnation. This contrasts with the freedom found in the New Covenant, where believers are adopted as children of God through faith in Christ.<p><b>This is Hagar</b><br>Hagar, the Egyptian maidservant of Sarah, becomes a symbol of the Old Covenant. Her story, found in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16 and 21</a>, illustrates the consequences of human efforts to fulfill God's promises through fleshly means. Hagar's relationship with Abraham and Sarah highlights the tension between human initiative and divine promise. In the allegory, Hagar's status as a slave and her son Ishmael's birth represent the limitations and bondage of the law, contrasting with the freedom and promise associated with Sarah and Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarah, Abraham's wife, who bore Abraham's first son, Ishmael.

When we open the Old Testament, we are meant to see more than ancient biography&#8212;we see God&#8217;s intentional foreshadowing of the gospel (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the women represent two covenants</b><p>&#8226; Hagar and Sarah stand for two very different ways of relating to God.<p>&#8226; Hagar embodies the covenant of law; Sarah embodies the covenant of promise (<a href="/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The Old Covenant demands obedience first (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;8</a>); the New Covenant provides new hearts so we can obey (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31&#8211;34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6&#8211;13</a>).<p>By placing the spotlight on these two mothers, Paul drives home that everyone is spiritually born into one covenant or the other.

God&#8217;s law is holy, righteous, and good (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), yet it was never given to save; it was given to expose sin (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). Sinai thus marks a covenant characterized by external commands and earthly sanctuary (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1</a>), a contrast to the heavenly, Spirit-filled life found in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bears children into slavery</b><p>The law cannot free from sin; it magnifies it (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7&#8211;13</a>).

Her union with Abraham produced Ishmael &#8220;according to the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-23.htm">Galatians 4:23</a>). In the allegory, she pictures:<p>&#8226; Bondage rather than inheritance (<a href="/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Flesh-born effort rather than Spirit-born promise (<a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>).<p>Hagar&#8217;s name thus becomes shorthand for any path that bypasses faith in God&#8217;s promise and depends on human strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/4-24.htm">Galatians 4:24</a> teaches that the true historical account of Hagar and Sarah doubles as a Spirit-given illustration of two covenants. Hagar represents the Sinai covenant of law, which can only produce bondage for those who rely on it. Sarah (though unmentioned in this single verse) points to the New Covenant of promise and freedom in Christ. Paul&#8217;s purpose is clear: abandon self-reliance, embrace the promise, and live as free heirs rather than slaves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Which things are an allegory.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Which things are allegorised</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> spoken in double sense,--<p>"Where more is meant than meets the ear."<p>The allegorical sense does not exclude the literal sense. but is added to it. In like manner St. Paul speaks of the events which happened to the Israelites in their wanderings in the wilderness as happening "for our ensamples," or, more correctly, "by way of types or figures" (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1Corinthians 10:11</a>): though elsewhere a distinction is drawn between "type" and "allegory," the first implying that the narrative on which it is based is true, the second that it is fictitious. St. Paul does not use the word here in this strict sense. The justification for the allegorical treatment of the patriarchal history may be expressed in the words of Calvin: "As the house of Abraham was at that time the true Church, so there can be no doubt that the chief and most memorable events which happened in it are so many types for us." At the same time, the argumentative force of the passage evidently rests upon the apostolic assertion of Christian liberty, not upon the logical cogency of the inference from the details of the type to the thing typified.<p><span class= "bld">These are the two covenants.</span>--"These," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>these women, Hagar and Sarah. "Are," in the sense of stand, for," "typically represent," as in the interpretation of the parable of the tares: "The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest <span class= "ital">is</span> the end of the world" (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39</a>); or, in the words of the institution of the Lord's Supper: "this <span class= "ital">is</span> my body . . . this <span class= "ital">is</span> my blood" (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), where the meaning is really as little doubtful as here. "The two covenants" should be simply "two covenants." <span class= "ital">What</span> covenants the Apostle goes on to explain. So, too, "the one" in the next clause should be rather <span class= "ital">one.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which things are an allegory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">which things are written</span> (or, <span class="accented">expounded</span>) <span class="accented">with a further meaning.</span> The relative <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f05;</span>, probably means "which facts, being of this description, are," etc., or, "things, which are of such a sort that they are," etc. (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a> in the Greek). The apostle, perhaps, intimates that the particulars just recited by him belong to a class of objects distinguished among other objects presented to us in the Old Testament by having a further sense than the literal historical one; the literal historical sense, however, by no means being thereby superseded. Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, "Now these things happened unto them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as figures [or, 'by way of figure ']." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is shown by lexicons, Liddell and Scott's and others, to mean, either to <span class="accented">speak</span> a thing allegorically or to <span class="accented">expound</span> a thing as allegorical. Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot furnish passages illustrative of both meanings, particularly of the second; and the latter adds the observation that it is possible that the apostle uses the verb here in the sense of being allegorically expounded, "referring to some recognized mode of interpretation." St. Paul did at times refer to authority extrinsical to his own (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-16.htm">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>). But whichever of the two possible senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was the one here intended by the apostle, there is no improbability in the supposition that not now for the first time was the narrative of Hagar and Ishmael thus applied: it is quite supposable, for instance, that it had been so applied at Antioch, in the animated discussions in which Paul, Barnabas, and Silas encountered the Judaists in that Church. At all events, it is not merely supposable, but in a high degree probable, that at least <span class="accented">some</span> of the historical personages, institutions, and events of the Old Testament Scriptures were wont to be allegorically treated by leaders of Christian thought of the highest authority. We cannot acquiesce in the position adopted by some critics, that such allegorizing is to be relegated to the region of mere Jewish rabbinism, now to be regarded as exploded. And we need not here insist upon the consideration that a rabbinical origin would constitute no valid objection to our acceptance of such allegorizing treatment of Scripture, because that the results of rabbinical exegesis and of rabbinical investigations in theology were in many cases of the highest value - a fact which those who are acquainted, for example, with Professor Reuss's 'Histoire de la Theologie Cbretienne' will not be disposed to question. For we resist the attempt to thrust us back upon the schools of the rabbins, as if it were from them only that St. Paul derived this allegorical method of Scripture exposition. Those schools may have made him acquainted with it, it is true; but altogether independently of rabbinical instruction, the leading teachers of the Church, even before Paul's conversion, "unlearned men," <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as the rabbinists regarded them, had, as we cannot doubt, learnt thus to apply Scripture in the school of Jesus. Christ himself, not only before his passion, but also, and we may believe with greater definiteness and particularity, after his resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 45</a>; <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), had imparted to his apostles and other disciples <span class="accented">some</span> expositions of historical facts of the Old Testament, which must have been of this description, and which would suggest the legitimate application of the same method in other analogous instances. And those men were not only disciples, pupils of Jesus, but were likewise especial, though not the exclusive, organs of the Holy Spirit's teaching in the Church (<a href="/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Particular allegorical expositions, therefore, received amongst those apostles and prophets of Christ, came clothed with the highest authority, emanating as they well might have done from Christ's own oral teaching, or from an immediate special leading of his Spirit. And, further, we feel ourselves entitled to believe that the supreme Revealer of spiritual truth to mankind might well think fit to appoint, not only words or ceremonial institutions as means of imparting religious instruction or of prophetical indication, but historical incidents as well; not merely so ordering the manner in which his inspired organs framed their <span class="accented">narratives</span> of certain occurrences as to make those narratives prophetical, but also in his disposal of human affairs so ordering the occurrences themselves as that <span class="accented">they</span> should be prophetical; furnishing (so to speak) <span class="accented">tableaux vivants</span>, in which the faith of his servants should read, ff not spiritual facts which were as yet future, at least spiritual facts after they had come to <span class="accented">pass</span>, the prophetical adumbration of which, now recognized by them, would serve to confirm their belief in them and their comprehension of them. The fact that Christ repeatedly and most pointedly referred to the strange experiences of Jonah as prophetical of his own passion and resurrection proves to a certainty that events might be predictive as well as utterances of prophets. Our Lord's use of the story of the brazen serpent, of the gift of manna, and of the Passover (<a href="/luke/22-16.htm">Luke 22:16</a>) points in the same direction. We have also apostolical guidance in construing the Passover, the Exodus, the story of Melehiscdec, Abraham's offering up of his son, the yearly Fast of the Atonement, as legitimately subject to similar treatment. Since the old economy with its histories and its ordinances originated from the same Divine Author as the new, it is no unreasonable belief that in the things of preparatory dispensations he had set foreshadowings, and in no scant number, of those great things in the spiritual economy which from "eternal ages" had been his thoughts towards us, and in which the whole progress of human history was to find its consummation. In the apostle's discussion of his subject there are in part distinctly specified, in part merely indicated, a great variety of contrasts; these the reader will find presented by Bengel in his 'Gnomon' in a tabulated form with great distinctness. For these are the two covenants; or, <span class="accented">testaments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for these women are two covenants.</span> The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. but the article is expunged by all recent editors. What the apostle means is this: the circumstance that Abraham had two wives pointed to the fact that there were to be, not one covenant only, but two. He has previously (<a href="/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15, 17</a>) spoken of "<span class="accented">the</span> promise" as a covenant; while also this term was already a familiar designation of the economy which God appointed to the natural "seed of Abraham." Compare also Jeremiah's mention of these two "<span class="accented">covenants"</span> (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>). For the use of the verb "<span class="accented">are</span>," <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="/matthew/13-37.htm">Matthew 13:37-39</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>.

The apostle assumes it to be a manifest fact, having before repeatedly asserted it, that those under the Law are in a condition of servitude. <span class="cmt_word">Which is Hagar</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>); <span class="accented">which is Hagar.</span> The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here is, "which being such in character as it is, is Hagar." This covenant, with its children, being wrapped in an element of slavery, is kindred in character with Hagar and her offspring. It is objected that Ishmael was not, in fact, a slave. But as Hagar does not appear to have been a recognized concubine of Abraham, in the same way as Bilhah and Zilpah were concubines of Jacob, but still continued to be Sarah's handmaid ("thy maid," <a href="/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>), her child was, of course, born into the same condition. With Sarah's consent, it is true, Abraham might, if he had thought fit, have <span class="accented">adopted</span> him as a child of his own; but this does not appear to have been done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These [things]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#940;</span> <span class="translit">(hatina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">serve as illustrations,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#275;goroumena)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_238.htm">Strong's 238: </a> </span><span class="str2">To speak allegorically.
