The Galatians were being influenced by Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation. Paul&#8217;s direct approach underscores the urgency and seriousness of the matter. This phrase reflects Paul's pastoral concern and his desire to correct their theological error.<p><b>Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law,</b><br>The reception of the Holy Spirit is a key theme in the New Testament, marking the believer's entry into the new covenant community. In <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, the Spirit is given at Pentecost, signifying the fulfillment of Jesus' promise and the empowerment of the church. The "works of the law" refers to the Jewish legal system, including circumcision, dietary laws, and ceremonial practices. Paul contrasts the Spirit's reception with these works, highlighting that the Spirit is a gift of grace, not a result of human effort or adherence to the law.<p><b>or by hearing with faith?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the means by which the Galatians received the Spirit: through faith, not by legalistic observance. "Hearing with faith" echoes <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the message of Christ. This reflects the broader biblical narrative that salvation and the accompanying gift of the Spirit are accessed through faith, as seen in the example of Abraham, who believed God and was counted as righteous (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). This faith-based reception aligns with the new covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people, indicating an internal transformation rather than external compliance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia with concerns about their understanding of the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by Judaizers to follow Jewish law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision, to be true Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, whose reception by believers is central to Paul's argument about faith versus works.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/law.htm">Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which some were teaching was necessary for salvation alongside faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_vs._works.htm">Faith vs. Works</a></b><br>Paul challenges the Galatians to consider how they received the Spirit, emphasizing that it was through faith, not adherence to the law.

Paul&#8217;s single, probing question exposes the folly of adding works to grace and reaffirms that life in Christ begins and continues by faith alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">This only.</span>--The Apostle considers a single argument enough. He will only place the present conduct of the Galatians in contrast with their past, and ask how they can possibly reconcile the two.<p><span class= "bld">Received ye the Spirit.</span>--The reference is to those spiritual gifts, described more fully in 1 Corinthians 12, 14--the gift of prophecy, the gift of tongues, the interpretation of tongues, the discerning of spirits, gifts of healing, &c.--which attended the first preaching of the gospel, and were poured out upon the first converts in a manner and degree since unknown. The Galatians, it seems, had had a share in this outpouring, like the other churches, though their fickleness prevented them from reaping the full benefit from it. But a spiritual effect, such as this outpouring was, could only have a spiritual cause; it could not come from a mechanical performance of legal obligations.<p><span class= "bld">By the works of the law.</span>--By works done in obedience to the Law. There is a certain emphasis on both words, for the main point in the contrast which the Apostle is drawing is between the Law, on the one hand, and faith, on the other. Still, faith is as much opposed to works (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a spirit of literal and mechanical obedience) as it is to Law, and excludes both at once. It is to be noted, however, that the works here meant are those done, in a Judaising sense, as themselves the direct means of salvation--not Christian works, the natural product and outcome of faith.<p><span class= "bld">By the hearing of faith.</span>--These words correspond very nearly to a phrase which we should perhaps use more naturally: <span class= "ital">by the preaching of faith</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by that preaching or hearing (hearing on the part of the recipients, preaching on that of the missionary Apostles) which has for its subject faith. What the Apostle had taught the Galatians on his first coming among them was not any system of laborious observances, but the duty of faith. They at first responded to his teaching: and in answer to their enthusiastic impulse of adhesion to Christ the gifts of the Spirit were abundantly shed upon them. Now all this had ceased. For the use of the word translated "hearing," see the Note on <a href="/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

The last appears more suitable here than the first taken (as some take it) as describing the doctrine or message which they heard respecting faith; standing as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> does in contrast to "works" which would have been an acting of theirs, this likewise was most probably meant by the apostle subjectively of something appearing on their own part. "Were you not at once received into the kingdom of God and filled with joy in the Holy Spirit, immediately upon your believing acceptance of the gospel message?" With exquisite propriety, as Bengel observes, is hereby marked the nature of faith, not working, but receiving. This agrees also best with the illustration which in ver. 6 the apostle gives of the phrase as introduced by him again in ver. 5. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I would like</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(thel&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to learn</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(mathein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3129.htm">Strong's 3129: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prolongation from a primary verb, another form of which, matheo, is used as an alternate in certain tenses; to learn.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">just</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(monon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3440.htm">Strong's 3440: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alone, but, only.
