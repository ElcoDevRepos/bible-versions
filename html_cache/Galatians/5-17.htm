This sinful nature is in direct opposition to the "Spirit," which refers to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, who indwells believers. The flesh's cravings are desires that lead away from God's will, often manifesting in behaviors and attitudes that are self-centered and sinful. This internal conflict is a common theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-25</a>, where he describes the struggle between the sinful nature and the desire to follow God's law. The Spirit, on the other hand, leads believers towards righteousness and holiness, aligning with God's will and purposes.<p><b>and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh</b><br>The Holy Spirit actively works within believers to produce fruit that is in stark contrast to the works of the flesh. This is further elaborated in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit is listed, including love, joy, peace, and self-control. The Spirit's role is to sanctify believers, transforming them into the likeness of Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. This transformation is a process that involves resisting the flesh's desires and submitting to the Spirit's leading. The Spirit empowers believers to overcome the flesh, as promised in <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, where living by the Spirit enables one to put to death the deeds of the body.<p><b>They are opposed to each other</b><br>This opposition is a fundamental aspect of the Christian life, highlighting the ongoing spiritual warfare that believers face. The Greek word used here for "opposed" suggests a strong, active resistance, indicating that the flesh and the Spirit are in constant conflict. This battle is not merely a passive struggle but an active engagement that requires vigilance and reliance on God's power. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> reminds believers that their struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces, emphasizing the need for spiritual armor and dependence on God.<p><b>so that you do not do what you want</b><br>This phrase reflects the tension between the believer's desires and the reality of living in a fallen world. Even with the indwelling Spirit, believers experience moments of failure and sin, as the flesh can sometimes overpower the Spirit's influence. This struggle is echoed in <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15-20</a>, where Paul expresses his frustration with doing what he hates instead of what he desires to do. However, this tension also serves as a reminder of the need for grace and the importance of continual reliance on Christ's strength, as stated in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>. The ultimate victory over the flesh is assured through Christ, as believers are promised transformation and glorification in the life to come, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50-57</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the conflict between living by the flesh and living by the Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of the letter resided.

It does not amount to dualism, for the body, as such, is not regarded as evil. There is nothing to show that St. Paul considered matter <span class= "ital">in itself</span> evil. But the body <span class= "ital">becomes the seat</span> of evil; from it arise those carnal impulses which are the origin of sin. And it is the body, looked at in this light, which is designated as "the flesh." The flesh is the body, as animated by an evil principle.

Then the apostle adds, "<span class="accented">but</span> the Spirit <span class="accented">likewise</span> [or, ' <span class="accented">hath desires</span> ] against the flesh;" intimating that, although the flesh was still at work within, prompting desires tending away from holiness, <span class="accented">that</span> nevertheless was no reason for their giving way to such evil inclinations; for the Spirit was with them as well, originating desires after what was holy and good; and he would help them against those other inclinations towards evil, if only they would surrender themselves to his guidance. That this is the proper way of construing these two passages seems betokened by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. If the apostle had just here meant to say, "There are two mutually opposing principles at work within you" for the purpose of justifying by explicit statement the tone of ver. 16 which <span class="accented">implies</span> this fact, he would have written, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: or, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> etc.; "For both hath the flesh desires against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh; or, "for on the one hand the flesh hath desires... and on the other," etc. But the adversative <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> standing alone tends to disjoin the two clauses rather than to conjoin them so closely together as the Authorized Version leads us to suppose. We need supply no ether verb than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "hath desires," with the words, "but the Spirit;" for this verb is used in a good sense as well as in a bad; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "with desire did I desire;" <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>, "the angels desire (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) to look into;" <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>.

The apostle having been by two several turns of thought led to state, first that the flesh prompts desires or action in opposition to the Spirit, and then, as a distinct sentence, that the Spirit prompts desires or action in opposition to the flesh, he now conjoins the two several notions in the affirmation of the mutual antagonistic agency of these two principles; "For these oppose themselves the one to the other." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> always denotes opposing action, and not mere contrariety of nature; being used as a participial noun for "adversaries" or "opponents' ' in <a href="/luke/13-17.htm">Luke 13:17</a>; <a href="/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>. i4; and as a verb in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, to denote setting one's self in opposition to. This clause, therefore, describes the continual endeavour of the flesh and of the Spirit to thwart and defeat each other's action in the hearts of the persons spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">So that</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye cannot do the things that ye would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1fb3;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">to the end that what things soever ye fain would do</span>, <span class="accented">those ye shall not</span> do. This last clause describes the <span class="accented">result aimed at</span> by each of those conflicting principles, namely, to thwart each of them the volitions prompted by the other. The words remind us of <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "For not, what thing I fain would,that do I practise;" ibid., 16, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, "What thing I fain would not, that I do;" ibid., 19, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "For not what good thing I fain would, do I do; but what evil thing I fain would not, that I practise." The comparison of the indefinite relative, "what things soever ye fain would do (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)," in the present passage, with the more definite "what thing I fain would do," or "fain would not do (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>)," in the Romans, points to the conclusion that by the clause, "what things soever ye fain would do," is meant, "whichever be the kind of your volitions, whether they be those prompted by the flesh or those prompted by the Spirit." In comparing the two passages, it is important to notice that in the seventh chapter of the Romans the apostle is Concerned exclusively with the frustration of our <span class="accented">good</span> volitions, which, there, are not ascribed to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, but to the prompting of our own moral sense quickened by the voice of the Law's commandment. Such good volitions he represents as overpowered by the controlling influence ("law" ) of the evil principle, "the flesh;" a condition of miserable thraldom, out of which, the apostle (ibid., 25), with triumphant gratitude, alludes to believers in Christ being delivered - delivered by the coming in upon the scene of a new agent, "the Spirit of life:" whereas, in the passage before us, he is describing the condition of believers in Christ, to whom now has been imparted this new power for doing what is good. In these, "the mind" (<a href="/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>), powerless before to overcome the law of sin, is succoured by the presence of a mighty Ally, through whom, he intimates elsewhere, the believer has it within his power to do all things (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). Many expositors, in-eluding Bishop Lightfoot, take <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the present clause us denoting simply the result actually brought about; thus the Authorized Version, "so that ye cannot do the things that ye would." Whether this sense, of result actually produced, can be shown ever to attach to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> followed by the subjunctive, is a question which has been much debated. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4</a>, "Ye are not in darkness that (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) that day should overtake you as a thief," the particle "that" points to the ordering of Divine providence spoken of in the two preceding verses, that they who are in darkness <span class="accented">should</span> be taken by surprise by the coming of the day of the Lord. It is certainly possible so to understand the particle here; the mutually thwarting agency of the flesh and the Spirit may be understood as latently attributed to Divine providence ordering that thus it should be. But this view would hardly seem to harmonize, either with the almightiness of the Divine Agent engaged in the conflict or with the triumphant language of <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>. In actual experience, it does indeed seem to be but too often almost a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> a drawn battle; so greatly is the Spirit's agency dogged and hampered by the weakness of human faith and the inconstancy of human purpose. But it does not need to be so. In the case of St. Paul himself, as we may infer from all that he says of his own career subsequent to his conversion, and in perhaps not a few cases besides, the Spirit has been completely and persistently triumphant. It therefore appears inconvenient to suppose that the apostle means to ascribe such a result to the ordering of Divine providence making it inevitable. Certainly such a construction of the passage is not necessary. We escape from it altogether by ascribing the notion of purpose latent in this <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "to the end that," to the nisus severally of the two agents. Taken so, the passage affirms this: Will whatever you may, whether good or evil, you will be sure to meet with an adverse agency, striving to bar the complete accomplishment of your desire. There appears to be no good reason for limiting the application of this statement, as some propose our doing, to the case of immature Christians, in whom Christ is as yet imperfectly formed (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>). With every Christian, to the very last, the life of holiness can only be a fruit of <span class="accented">conflict</span>; a conflict on the whole, even perhaps persistently, successful; yet a conflict still, maintained by the help of the Spirit against an evil principle, which can never, as long as we live, cease to give occasion for care and watchfulness (see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). Why, it may be asked, is the apostle concerned to refer to this conflict here? Apparently because the Galatians showed by their behaviour that they needed to be stirred up and put upon their guard. They were, as the apostle (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>) told the Corinthian believers <span class="accented">they</span> were, "carnal, walking as men." They had foregone the sense of their adoption; they were worrying one another with contentions. The flesh was in their case manifestly thwarting and defeating the desires of the Spirit. Therefore the apostle here reminds them of the conditions of the Christian life; it is to stimulate them to that earnest endeavour to walk by the Spirit, without which (ver. 24) they could not be Christ' s. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
