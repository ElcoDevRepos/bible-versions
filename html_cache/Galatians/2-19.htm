The law, given through Moses, was intended to reveal sin and lead people to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). Paul, a former Pharisee, understood the law deeply and recognized its role in highlighting human inability to achieve righteousness on their own (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-13</a>). The law serves as a mirror, showing the need for a savior.<p><b>I died to the law</b><br>Paul's statement of dying to the law signifies a fundamental change in his relationship with it. This death is metaphorical, representing a release from the law's demands and penalties. In <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>, Paul explains that believers have died to the law through the body of Christ, allowing them to belong to another, namely Christ. This death to the law is necessary for living a new life in the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>).<p><b>so that I might live to God</b><br>The purpose of dying to the law is to live a life dedicated to God. This new life is characterized by faith and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). Living to God involves a transformation that aligns with the teachings of Jesus, emphasizing love, grace, and obedience to God's will.

The "I" of <a href="/galatians/2-18.htm" title="For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.">Galatians 2:18</a> is really St. Peter or the Judaisers; the "I" of this verse is St. Paul himself. The object of his appeal is to make good his assertion that to restore the dethroned Law to its old position is positively sinful.<p>Once having done with the Law I had done with it for ever. The Law itself had prepared me for this. It was a stage which I could not but pass through, but which was in its very nature temporary. It carried with it the sentence of its own dissolution.<p><span class= "bld">For . . .</span>--This assigns the reason for the use of the word "transgressor" in the verse before. It is a transgression to rebuild the demolished fabric of the Law, because the true Christian has done with the Law once for all.<p><span class= "bld">Through the law am dead to the law.</span>--In what sense can this be said? The Apostle himself had got rid of his obligations to the Law--not, however, by simply evading them from the first, but by passing through a period of subjection to them. The road to freedom from the Law lay through the Law. The Law, on its prophetic side, pointed to Christ. The Law, on its moral side, held up an ideal to which its votaries could not attain. It did not help them to attain to it. It bore the stamp of its own insufficiency. Men broke its precepts, and its weakness seemed to lead up to a dispensation that should supersede its own. St. Paul would not have become a Christian if he had not first sat at the feet of Gamaliel. If we could trace the whole under-current of silent, and perhaps only half-conscious, preparation, which led to the Apostle's conversion, we should see how large a part was played in it by the sense, gradually wrought in him, of the Law's insufficiency. Thus the negative side was given by his own private meditation; the positive side, faith in Christ, was given by the vision on the road to Damascus.<p><span class= "bld">That I might live unto God.</span>--We might not unnaturally expect here "unto Christ," instead of "unto God." But the Christian lives unto Christ <span class= "ital">in</span> <span class= "ital">order that</span> he may live unto God. The ultimate object of the Christian scheme is that he may be presented righteous before God. By the Law he could not obtain this righteousness. It is obtained in Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I through the Law am dead to the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,); <span class="accented">for I</span>, <span class="accented">for my part</span>, <span class="accented">through the Law died unto the Law.</span> This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is not the hypothetical "I" of ver. 18, which in fact recites the personality of St. Peter, but is St. Paul himself in his own concrete historical personality. And the pronoun is in a measure antithetical; as if it were: for whatever may be your feeling, mine is this, that I," etc. The conjunction "for" points back to the whole passage (vers. 15-18), which has described the position to which St. Paul had himself been brought and on which he still now, when writing to the Galatians, is standing; he here justifies that description. "Through the Law;" through the Law's own procuring, through what the Law itself did, I was broken off from all connection with the Law. From the words, "I have been crucified with Christ," in the next verse, and from what we read in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, most especially when taken in connection with the occurrences at Antioch which at any rate led to the present utterance, and with the hankering after Judaical ceremonialism in Galatia which occasioned the writing of this letter, we may with confidence draw the conclusion that St. Paul is thinking of the Law in its ceremonial aspect, that is, viewed as determining ceremonial purity and ceremonial pollution. He is here most immediately dealing with the question, whether Jewish believers could freely associate without defilement in God's sight with Gentile believers who according to the Levitical Law were unclean, and could partake of the like food with them. The notion of becoming dead to the Law through the cross of Christ has other aspects besides this, as is evinced by <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; a fact which is indeed glanced at by the apostle even here; but of the several aspects presented by this one and the same many-faced truth, the one which he here more particularly refers to is that which it bore towards the Law as a ceremonial institute. That which the Law as a ceremonial institute did in relation to Christ was this - it pronounced him as crucified to be in the intensest degree ceremonially accursed and polluting; to be most absolutely <span class="accented">cherem.</span> But Christ in his death and resurrection-life is appointed by God to be the sinner's only and complete salvation. It follows that he who by faith and sacrament is made one with Christ, does, together with the spiritual life which he draws from Christ, partake also in the pollution and accursedness which the Law fastens upon <span class="accented">him</span>; he is by the Law bidden away: he can thenceforth have no connection with it, - the Law itself will have it so. "But (the apostle's feeling is) the Law may curse on as it will: I have life with God and in God nevertheless." This same aspect of the death of Christ as disconnecting believers from the Law viewed as a ceremonial institute, through the pollutedness which the Law attached to most especially that form of death, is referred to in <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-13</a>. The phrase, "I died unto the Law," is similar to that of "being made dead to the Law" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>), and being "discharged [or, 'delivered'] from the Law (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)," which we have <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4, 6</a>; though the particular aspect of the fact that the cross disconnects believers from the Law is not precisely the same in the two passages, since in the Romans the Law is viewed more in its character as a rule of moral and spiritual life (see <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might live unto God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">that I might become alive unto God.</span> It is not likely that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is a future indicative, although we have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and the form <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>; for the future would most probably have been <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11, 12</a>; and <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>. It is more likely to be the subjunctive of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, which, according to the now accepted reading of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, we have in <a href="/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; where, as well as the <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>, it means "become alive." In verbs denoting a <span class="accented">state</span> of being, the aorist frequently (though not necessarily) means coming into that state, as for example, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "became poor" (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a>). "Living unto God" here, as in <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>, does not so much denote any form of moral <span class="accented">action</span> towards God as that spiritual state towards him out of which suitable moral action would subsequently flow. The apostle died to the Law, in order that through Christ he might come into that vital union with God in which he might both serve him and find happiness in him; this service to God and joy in God being the "fruit-bearing" in which the "life" is manifested (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
