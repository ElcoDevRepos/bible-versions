In the context of his ministry, Paul faced opposition from Judaizers who sought to impose Jewish customs on Gentile converts. This question highlights the tension between adhering to human traditions and following God's will. The early church often struggled with this balance, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council. Paul's commitment to God's approval is a theme echoed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, where he states that he speaks not to please men, but God who tests hearts.<p><b>Or am I striving to please men?</b><br>This phrase underscores the potential conflict between pleasing people and serving God. In the Greco-Roman world, social status and honor were highly valued, and leaders often sought public approval. Paul contrasts this cultural norm with the Christian call to prioritize God's will. The apostle's life, marked by persecution and hardship (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>), serves as evidence of his commitment to God's mission over human accolades. This idea is further supported by Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>, where He questions how one can believe if they seek glory from one another rather than from God.<p><b>If I were still trying to please men,</b><br>Paul reflects on his past as a Pharisee, where he once sought the approval of religious leaders (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-6</a>). His transformation on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) marked a shift from seeking human approval to serving Christ. This change illustrates the transformative power of the Gospel and the call to a new identity in Christ. The use of "still" implies a past life that was characterized by a different set of values and priorities, now abandoned for the sake of the Gospel.<p><b>I would not be a servant of Christ.</b><br>Paul concludes with a definitive statement about his allegiance. The term "servant" (Greek: doulos) implies total devotion and submission to Christ, akin to a bondservant's relationship with their master. This servitude is not burdensome but a willing and joyful commitment, as seen in <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, where Paul identifies himself as a servant of Christ Jesus. The concept of servanthood is central to Christian discipleship, reflecting Jesus' own example in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, where He came not to be served, but to serve. This phrase encapsulates the essence of Christian identity and mission, prioritizing God's will above all else.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of legalism and the true gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>- A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of the letter lived.

Jesus used the same stark contrast in <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a> when warning against practicing righteousness &#8220;before men to be seen by them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a> mirrors Paul&#8217;s thinking: &#8220;We speak not to please men, but God, who tests our hearts.&#8221; God alone sees the inner motive, so His approval is all-important.<p>&#8226; This question invites personal reflection: in my choices, conversations, and ministry, do I look first for God&#8217;s smile or people&#8217;s affirmation?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or am I striving to please men?</b><p>Paul repeats the idea to expose how subtle people-pleasing can be.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;striving&#8221; pictures sustained effort. Pleasing people can become a driving ambition, as seen in <a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42-43</a> where many leaders &#8220;loved praise from men more than praise from God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; People-pleasing often disguises itself as kindness or diplomacy, yet Scripture warns that it can dilute truth (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> redirects our striving: &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By asking twice, Paul exposes the tug-of-war inside every believer and urges us to settle the matter decisively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</b><p>Paul closes with an unyielding conclusion: the two pursuits are mutually exclusive.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Still&#8221; points back to his pre-conversion life; that chapter closed on the Damascus Road (<a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14-18</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;servant&#8221; (literally bond-slave) has a single master. Jesus said, &#8220;No one can serve two masters&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Divided loyalties cancel true discipleship.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s life illustrates the cost: beatings, imprisonments, and rejection proved he was not currying favor with people (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel itself offends human pride by insisting on grace alone (<a href="/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>). Remaining faithful to that message will inevitably invite human displeasure&#8212;and divine commendation (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a> sets a clear line in the sand: we live either for the fleeting approval of people or for the eternal approval of God. Paul&#8217;s transformation shows that once Christ becomes Master, the applause of men loses its grip. Our calling is to serve Christ with undivided hearts, confident that His &#8220;Well done&#8221; outweighs every human opinion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) You may take this vehemence of language as my answer to another charge that has been brought against me. I am accused of seeking popularity with men. Well, here at least is plainness of speech. If I seek to win favour with any one it is not with men, but God. The two things are really incompatible. If I were a. favourite with men I should be no true servant of Christ.<p>St. Paul naturally laid himself open to the charge of men-pleasing by the flexibility and largeness of his character. The trifles about which others quarrelled he could look upon with indifference, and his ready power of sympathy led him to enter as much as possible into the point of view of others: "To the Jews he became as a <span class= "ital">Jew,"</span> &c. But where a question of principle was at stake he knew how to take his stand, and he let the Galatians see it in the very unequivocal language he is now using.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Now.</span>--<span class= "ital">In speaking thus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Persuade.</span>--<span class= "ital">Conciliate, seek to win favour with,</span> or <span class= "ital">to make friends of.</span><p><span class= "bld">For.</span>--This word is omitted by all the best MSS. and editors. It is characteristic of the Apostle, especially in animated passages like the present, to omit the connecting particles which are so common in Greek. He has a simple answer to give to the accusation of time-serving, and he states it roundly: "If my present conduct was really that of a man-pleaser I should be something very different from what I am."<p><span class= "bld">Yet.</span>--<span class= "ital">Still; at this late period of my career.</span> The Apostle has cut himself adrift from the current of his age too thoroughly and too long for him to be still floating with the tide.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For do I now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>); <span class="accented">for at this hour.</span> This "for" points back either to the fact of the apostle's having now so solemnly pronounced afresh the awful anathema which at some former time he had uttered; or which, in effect, is nearly the same thing, to the tone of feeling which he in so doing evinced, and to his method of apostolic action which he therein exemplified. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, as used in the New Testament, is distinguished from the more common "now" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), as denoting that space of time which is most closely present. This shade of meaning is conspicuous, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the "Suffer it to be so just now" of <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>, that is, during that brief, quickly vanishing moment in which the Messiah was by Divine appointment to appear subordinate in position to his forerunner. So <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>, "Thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at this very moment send me more than twelve legions of angels?" <a href="/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>, "Ye cannot bear them (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) just now;" in a very short while they would be enabled to bear them. <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, "Just now (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) we see in a mirror, darkly;" words written under a vivid sense of how brief the interval is which separates the present state of things from that of the life to come. <a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>, "On whom, though just now (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) ye see him not " - another outcome of the same feeling. Similarly, in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "until this very hour;" and, on the other side of the point of time indicated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is "from this very hour" in <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="/john/4-42.htm">John 4:42</a>. Many have supposed that the apostle is speaking of certain characteristics of his present course of behaviour as a believer and a servant of Christ, viewed in contrast with the life which he had once lived when an ardent disciple of Judaism. But the narrowly restrictive form of the adverb resists this interpretation, he could hardly with this reference in view have used the phrase "just now," or "at this very hour," of a tenor of life which he had been pursuing for now more than twenty years. Some eminent critics (Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Sanday) take this <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as pointing to the style of language which the apostle is "just now" adopting: "Now, when I use such uncompromising language;" or, "There! is that the language of a man-pleaser? <span class="accented">Now</span> do I," etc. It is an objection to this view that it gives the adverb a somewhat diverse sense to that which it bears in ver. 9; for whereas in ver. 9 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, points to the circumstances of the present hour as prompting the apostle to the utterance of his anathema, according to the view referred to it here points to the present hour as exhibiting the <span class="accented">apostle himself</span> in a certain aspect. It is more obvious, and indeed gives the present use of the adverb more force, to take it in both verses with the like reference. In both the apostle refers to the present hour as a juncture in which he felt that it had become necessary to depart from his customary manner of using a winning style of address. At other times he will persuade and please; <span class="accented">just now</span> he cannot. <span class="cmt_word">Persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men</span>? (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">do I persuade men or God</span>? <span class="accented">or do I seek to please</span> men? Expositors have endeavoured to establish, as one sense of the Greek verb rendered "persuade," that of "making So-and-so one's friend." No doubt it often means to prevail, or endeavour to prevail, upon others, by coaxing, persuasion, bribery, or anyhow, to go along with you in some particular course of thinking or acting indicated by the context; but it can nowhere. be shown to mean, when standing alone, "to win So-and-so's friendship." In <a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>, "Having persuaded Blastus" means "Having got Blastus to concur with them." Similarly, <a href="/matthew/28-14.htm">Matthew 28:14</a>, "We will persuade him," and 2 Macc. 4:45, "With a view to persuade the king." The verb is used here, in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, "Knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men." In that passage the apostle states it to be his practice to make use of all means of persuasion in order to induce men to accept the gospel message (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>, "Working together with him, we intreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain"). He was not content with merely, as an ambassador, delivering the message and there leaving the matter; but made it his anxious concern to gain for the message acceptance, by the use of arguments addressed to the reason, and appeals addressed to the feelings, by putting himself, as it were, by the side of those he was addressing as one who sympathized to a large extent with their ways of thought, for the purpose of conducting them onward to concurrence with more perfect views. Among many examples which might be cited, illustrating his skill in persuasion, it will suffice to refer to the manner in which he dealt with the Athenians, with the Jews when speaking to them from the stairs, with King Agrippa (<a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>; <a href="/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1-21</a>; <a href="/acts/26-2.htm">Acts 26:2, 3, 26, 27</a>), and to his Epistle to Philemon. Another feature, closely connected with the one now mentioned, and here likewise referred to, is the care which the apostle took to "please men;" such a care as produced a manner towards his fellow-men far exceeding the courtesy and shows of respectful consideration which the law of charity ordinarily prescribes. For example, instead of thrusting forward into notice, as the spirit of unsympathetic pride naturally prompts us to do, the points on which he differed from others, and in reference to which he <span class="accented">knew</span> himself to he standing on higher ground than they, he chose rather to make prominent any points of agreement which he could find already subsisting, conciliating their candid interest by thus fraternally putting himself on a level with them. If this did not suffice for the purpose of enlisting their sympathies on behalf of himself and his views, he did not hesitate, in matters morally indifferent, to mortify and snub his own tastes, and forego the dissenting judgments of his. own superior enlightenment, "to buffet his body, as he expresses himself in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, "and bring it into bondage," by following, how ever distasteful to himself, such practices as should get those whose spiritual improvement he was seeking, to feel, so to speak, comfortably at home with himself. In writing to the Corinthians the apostle in one passage (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>) dwells at stone length upon this feature of his ministerial conduct, not ashamed of it, but manifestly glorying in it as a triumph of Christ's grace in his soul. Presently after, at the close of the following chapter, he distinctly propounds himself, as in this respect a Christ-like pattern, for their imitation, "Even [he writes] as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved: be ye imitators of me, even as! also am of Christ." Both of these strongly marked features of his ministerial character were liable to he misunderstood, and by his detractors could be easily misconstrued as grave faults, he was, in fact, accused of speciousness and insincerity, of double faced dealings, of simulation and dissimulation. We can easily understand how readily such accusations would be set on foot, and holy colourable they could be made to appear. That they painfully affected the apostle's mind is evidenced by the frequency of the references he makes to them, and by the earnestness and deep pathos of feeling which not seldom mark those references. It is to such sinister criticism that he alludes, when in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, cited above, after saying, "we persuade men," he adds, "but we are become manifest unto God," meaning that, though he did make a habit of laying himself out to persuade, yet the entire sincerity of his action, however misconstrued by men, was patent to the Divine eye (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>). Now, we have reason to believe that the apostle had been apprised, or at least that he suspected, that in Galatia also such misrepresentation of these characteristics of his ministry was rife. The Epistle supplies at least one token of such having probably been the case, We gather from <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a> that he had been said to be still "preaching circumcision." They who said this did so apparently in the sense that his having hitherto kept back this point of his doctrine in preaching to them was only an artifice of "persuasion;" that, in order to prevail upon them to accept the Christian faith, he had thought it expedient not at first to press upon them the observances of Judaism, while nevertheless he knew them to be necessary and was prepared by-and-by to insist upon their being attended to. St. Paul is conscious, therefore, of the existence on the part of some of the Galatian Churchmen of unfriendly suspicions with regard to his straightforwardness and uprightness. It is this stinging consciousness that occasions both the substance and the sharp abrupt tone of what he here says. The substance of the verse may be paraphrased thus: "I have written decisively and sternly; for at such a critical juncture as the present is it men that I can make it my business to 'persuade,' as they sneeringly but not un-truly say I love to do? or is it God that I care, so to speak, to persuade, to wit of my fidelity to the gospel which he has committed to my trust? They scoffingly say I love to 'please men;' and I thank God I have been wont to 'please men' to the very utmost of my power for their good; but is it my work just now to be pleasing men by ways of sweet tenderness and forbearance? If at this time I were still laying myself out to 'please men,' these men, to wit, who are making havoc of the gospel message, and you who are ignorantly listening to them, - then were I no true servant of Christ." The interrogative form into which the apostle's language suddenly breaks is apparently, here also as in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, due to his that moment bethinking himself of those malicious censurers of him. We have here an example of the form of sentence which the grammarians call zeugma; that is to say, "God" is named in conjunction with "men," as an object to the action of the verb "persuade," whereas this verb, suitable enough with relation to men, can only by a strain upon its proper sense be employed with relation to God. The sentence would possibly have expressed what appears to have been the apostle's real meaning with less ruggedness, but certainly with less intensity, if its second clause had been (perhaps), "or commend myself to God's approval? (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>;)." (For other instances of zeugma, see <a href="/luke/1-64.htm">Luke 1:64</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>.) The addition of the article before <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, while it is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, gives the noun a more grandiose tone, as if it were, "Do I persuade men or GOD?" <span class="cmt_word">For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">if I still were pleasing men</span>, <span class="accented">I were no servant</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">bondserrant</span>) <span class="accented">of Christ's.</span> The received text of the Greek has "For if I still (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>);" but the "for" is omitted by recent editors. It makes no difference in the sense whether we retain it or not, for, retaining the "for," we should have to understand before it, "I trow not," or the like. The word "bondservant" here expresses the official relation of a Christian minister, one especially at his Divine Owner's beck and call. So <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>; <a href="/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>. The apostle means, "I were no servant of Christ in spirit and reality, whatever I might call myself." A good many expositors suppose the "still" to be said with reference to the time before the apostle's conversion: "I were no apostle or Christian at all." But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> there is no indication either in this passage or anywhere that the apostle regarded his life before his conversion as characterized by the desire to please men; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the sense thus given to it, the thought, as Meyer observes, seems excessively tame; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as thus explained, it would not harmonize with the apostle's explicit and repeated declaration that, in the discharge of his high office, he did make a point of pleasing men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Am I} now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#961;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Arti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_737.htm">Strong's 737: </a> </span><span class="str2">Now, just now, at this moment.
