Paul often uses Old Testament scripture to support his arguments, demonstrating the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. This method of argumentation was common in Jewish teaching, where the authority of scripture was paramount.<p><b>&#8220;Rejoice, O barren woman, who bears no children;</b><br>The reference to a barren woman is symbolic, representing those who are spiritually unfruitful or marginalized. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, barrenness was often seen as a curse or a sign of disfavor. However, this passage turns that notion on its head, calling for joy despite the lack of children. This can be seen as a metaphor for the Gentiles, who were once outside the covenant but are now included in God's promises.<p><b>break forth and cry aloud, you who have never travailed;</b><br>The call to "break forth and cry aloud" is an expression of exuberant joy and celebration. In the historical context, childbirth was a significant event, and the absence of labor pains signifies a miraculous birth. This can be connected to the idea of spiritual rebirth and the new covenant, where the Gentiles are brought into the family of God without the traditional "labor" of the law.<p><b>because more are the children of the desolate woman</b><br>This phrase highlights the surprising and abundant growth of the spiritual family of God. The "desolate woman" symbolizes those who were once without hope or promise, yet now they have more children than those who were traditionally seen as blessed. This can be linked to the expansion of the church and the inclusion of the Gentiles, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>).<p><b>than of her who has a husband.&#8221;</b><br>The "woman who has a husband" represents those who were part of the old covenant, specifically the Jewish people who were under the law. The contrast here emphasizes the shift from the old covenant to the new covenant, where faith in Christ, rather than adherence to the law, is the basis for inclusion in God's family. This reflects the prophetic nature of Isaiah's words, pointing to a future where God's people are defined by faith rather than ethnicity or legal adherence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia to correct false teachings and affirm the true gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah_the_prophet.htm">Isaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>The original source of the quotation in <a href="/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a>, found in <a href="/isaiah/54.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>, which speaks to the restoration and blessing of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah_and_hagar.htm">Sarah and Hagar</a></b><br>The allegorical figures Paul uses in <a href="/bsb/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a> to contrast the old covenant of the law (Hagar) with the new covenant of grace (Sarah).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>Represents the spiritual city of God, contrasted with the earthly Jerusalem, symbolizing the new covenant of freedom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatian_churches.htm">Galatian Churches</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_heritage.htm">Understanding Spiritual Heritage</a></b><br>The barren woman represents those who seem spiritually desolate but are promised a greater spiritual heritage through faith in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_christ.htm">Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>Just as Sarah's children are free, believers are called to live in the freedom of the new covenant, not under the bondage of the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_promises.htm">Joy in God's Promises</a></b><br>The call to "rejoice" is a reminder that God's promises bring joy and fulfillment beyond our current circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_works.htm">Faith Over Works</a></b><br>The allegory of Sarah and Hagar emphasizes that righteousness and inheritance come through faith, not through adherence to the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_the_desolate.htm">Hope for the Desolate</a></b><br>Those who feel spiritually barren or unfruitful are encouraged to trust in God's ability to bring about growth and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Galatians_4_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 4:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_4_27_God_s_promise_fulfilled.htm">How does Galatians 4:27 illustrate God's power to fulfill His promises?

Literally, Zion seemed abandoned, yet God promised a miraculous future.<p>&#8226; By placing the verse in <a href="/bsb/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>, Paul links &#8220;barren&#8221; to Sarah (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>; 21:1-7) and to the &#8220;Jerusalem above&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). Like Sarah, she had no natural power to conceive, but God&#8217;s promise prevailed.<p>&#8226; The church, comprising believing Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>), once looked empty of hope, yet receives the same command: rejoice, because God keeps His word exactly.<p>&#8226; Cross-references: <a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>; <a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7-14</a>. In every case God turns literal barrenness into literal blessing, showcasing His grace over human inability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>break forth and cry aloud, you who have never travailed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Break forth&#8221; pictures an outburst of praise (<a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10-11</a>). The woman who &#8220;never travailed&#8221; had no labor pains, underscoring that fruitfulness comes apart from human effort.<p>&#8226; Paul applies this to believers rescued from the law&#8217;s demands (<a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10-14</a>). Salvation is not birthed by our own striving but by God&#8217;s supernatural intervention (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Hannah echoes the same theme, moving from barrenness to song (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1-5</a>).

Like Sarah and Zion, we rejoice because His promise, not our effort, produces true fruit. The barren woman&#8217;s celebration, her unlabored song, and her unexpectedly vast family all testify that the God of Scripture keeps His literal, precise promises&#8212;and our only response is to break forth in confident praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Rejoice, thou barren.</span>--The quotation is from <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>. It has reference, in the first instance, to the restoration of the exiled Jews to Jerusalem and to the coming greatness of the newly-settled city. Though at present it is desolate and in ruins, it shall become greater and more populous than ever it had been in its best days before. The revived theocracy under Zerubbabel is naturally taken as a type of the final theocratic reign of the Messiah. The representation of the theocracy under the figure of marriage is common, both in the prophetic writings and in St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Thou barren that bearest not.</span>--This was originally spoken of the revived condition of Jerusalem, in which for a long time no children had been born. Here it is applied to the despised and persecuted condition of the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">Break forth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> into singing. The phrase is expressed in full in the Authorised version of <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The desolate. . . . she which hath an husband.</span>--In the original, Jerusalem after the exile, opposed to Jerusalem in the time of its prosperity under David and Solomon; in the typical application, Sarah, who had long been barren, as opposed to Hagar, whose marriage had been fruitful; in the anti-typical application, the new dispensation, Christianity, with its small beginnings, as opposed to the old dispensation, with its material possessions and privileges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>). The points indicated in the section of Isaiah (54.) referred to by the quotation which is made of the first verse, and which amply make good what the apostle has been stating and implying, are these: that a new economy was to appear; that by this economy a multitude of servants of God should be called into being; that this multitude should in numbers far surpass those called into being heretofore; that this economy, though newly manifested, had been in existence before, but comparatively unblest with offspring; that it was to be known as an economy of forgiving, adopting love, involving a principle of spiritual life and of spontaneous, no longer constrained and servile, obedience. We need not hesitate in asserting that the last-named features of the new economy were, in the apostle's view, included in the prediction he means to refer to, although not contained in those words of the prophet which he has expressly quoted. For it is one of the characteristics of a Jewish religious teacher's method of citing Scripture, noted by the learned Dr. Biesenthal, himself a Jew, in his 'Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews' ('Einleitung,' p. 54), that he is wont to omit in his express citation more or <span class="accented">less</span> of the passage referred to, leaving it to his hearer or reader to supply the omitted portions from his own knowledge, even when these are most material for the argument; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13, 14</a>, the" oath," fully recorded in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, is not itself contained in the citation made by the writer. The above-named, then, we may assume to have been points which the apostle regarded as contained in the passage he refers to, because they are contained in the section of which the cited words are an integral portion. Whatever may be thought of the applicability, <span class="accented">in a measure</span>, of the prophet's language in the section alluded to, to the case of Israel restored from the Babylonian captivity, yet that such an application furnishes no complete explanation of its import is clear from the circumstance that this jubilant prophesying follows immediately upon the delineation in the preceding chapter of the sufferings of Christ - a delineation which ended with the intimation of the results which should follow in the triumph over mighty powers opposing the Sufferer, and in the work of justification which he would accomplish upon "many" (<a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10-12</a>). That the section was understood by our Lord to refer to the new economy which he was himself to introduce, is evidenced by his citing the words, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord" (ver 13), as pointing to the spiritual illumination which should at the time referred to characterize the people of God universally, so universally that none would be numbered amongst God's true people, that is, amongst the disciples of his Son, who had not "heard from the Father" (<a href="/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). We have, then, in this section of Isaiah a distinctly <span class="accented">predictive</span> description of a condition of spiritual well-being which was to result from Christ's mediation; that is, of the illumination, peace and joyful sense of God's love which then should be the "heritage of the servants of the Lord." This, construed in the apostle's imagery, connecting itself with that of the words which he expressly quotes, is the large multiplication of the children of the freewoman, bringing forth her offspring into a state of freedom and adoption in the great Father's family. The Greek rendering of the passage given by the apostle is identical with that of the Vatican text of the Septuagint. The Alexandrian text varies only in adding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "and be glad," to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "cry." apparently to explain what kind of crying out was intended<span class="cmt_word">.

The Authorized Version as well as the Revised thus renders the Greek here; but in the original passage in Isaiah the former renders, "that didst not bear." the Hebrew having the preterite indicative; and similarly, the "travailest not" in the next clause here is "didst not travail" there.

It points in the present case to the solitary and unhappy condition of a woman "forsaken by her husband" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>). On the other hand, the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, render the one Hebrew word <span class="accented">be'ulah</span>, the passive participle of the verb <span class="accented">ba'al</span>, cohabit with. Compare the use of this verb in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24</a>. I ("married her," Authorized Version; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span>, Septuagint); <a href="/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>, "and be her husband." The words, therefore, denote her that had her husband living with her as such; "hath," as <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>. "The husband" is conceived of as belonging both to her and of right to the "desolate one." Perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> may be rendered "her husband." In the prophet's view, the "woman which had her husband" was the visible Israel, possessing the temple and the other tokens of the Lord's dwelling in her midst; the "desolate one" was the spiritual or the ideal Israel to be manifested in the future; for the present out of sight and seemingly in abeyance; but thereafter to he quickened into fertility by the inhabitation of the Lord (for he in the prophet's vision, ver. 5, is the Husband), revealed in his first suffering then glorified Servant as portrayed in the foregoing prophesying. So exactly do these two images correspond with "the Jerusalem that now is" and "the Jerusalem that is above," of the apostle's imagery, that his use of the prophet's words is plainly no mere accommodation to his purpose of language which was in reality alien to the subject, but is the citation of a passage regarded by him as strictly predictive, and therefore probative of the truth of his representation. The view of this prophecy of Isaiah found in Clemens Romanus, Ep. it., 'Ad Corinthians,' &sect; 2, and in Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' p. 88, which regards it as referring to the Gentile Church as contrasted with the Jewish, is plainly a misconception of its import: the rejoicing mother of the prophet, as well as the supernal Jerusalem of the apostle, knows of no distinction in her believing offspring, between Jew and Gentile, comprising both alike. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
