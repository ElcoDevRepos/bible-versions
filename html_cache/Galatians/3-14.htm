In the context of Galatians, Paul emphasizes that Christ's sacrifice on the cross redeems believers from the curse of the Law (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). This redemption is not just a release from the Law's penalties but a transformation into a new life in Christ. The idea of redemption is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God redeems Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This act of redemption is a type of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ.<p><b>in order that the blessing promised to Abraham</b><br>The blessing promised to Abraham refers to the covenant God made with him, which included the promise that all nations would be blessed through his offspring (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This promise is foundational to understanding the scope of God's plan for salvation, extending beyond the Jewish people to include all nations. The Abrahamic covenant is a key theme in Paul's argument, as he demonstrates that the Law, which came later, does not nullify the promise made to Abraham.<p><b>would come to the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of the Gentiles in the blessing of Abraham is a radical and transformative concept in the early church. Historically, the Jewish people were seen as God's chosen nation, but through Christ, the promise extends to all people, regardless of ethnic background. This inclusion fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The early church struggled with this concept, as seen in the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), where it was affirmed that Gentiles could be part of the church without adhering to the full Mosaic Law.<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b><br>The phrase "in Christ Jesus" signifies the means by which the Gentiles receive the blessing. It is through union with Christ that believers, both Jew and Gentile, become heirs to the promises of God. This union is a central theme in Paul's writings, emphasizing that all spiritual blessings are found in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). The concept of being "in Christ" denotes a profound spiritual reality where believers are identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.<p><b>so that by faith</b><br>Faith is the key mechanism by which individuals receive the promises of God. Paul contrasts faith with the works of the Law, arguing that it is through faith, not adherence to the Law, that one is justified before God (<a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>). This principle of justification by faith alone is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, rooted in the example of Abraham, who believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>we might receive the promise of the Spirit</b><br>The promise of the Spirit refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is given to all believers as a seal of their salvation and a guarantee of their inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>). The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the life of a believer, empowering them to live a life pleasing to God and transforming them into the image of Christ. The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2) marks the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, and signifies the new covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of faith, law, and the role of the Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God made promises, including the blessing that would extend to all nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are included in the promise of salvation through faith in Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>The Messiah through whom the blessings of Abraham are fulfilled and extended to all believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, promised to believers as a result of faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The blessing of Abraham is not limited to the Jewish people but extends to all nations through faith in Christ.

But on the other hand, it may be urged <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, though not as yet actually admitted, yet in the Divine purpose, and in the ordering of the conditions of the case, they might have come in, - the door was open, though the threshold not actually crossed; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that their admissibility may be supposed to have been in the Divine counsels the prerequisite condition of the Holy Spirit being imparted, it not being fitting that the Spirit should be given so long as the Law was, so to speak, standing there, authorized to debar from this, the most essential portion of "Abraham's blessing," any who were partakers of Abraham's blessing. In the three passages referred to as favouring the construing of the two clauses as co-ordinate, we have not as here two different results, but one and the same, only in the second clause more fully described. The second view seems, therefore, the more probable one. <span class="cmt_word">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: so most recent editors read, in place of <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">that upon</span> "<span class="accented">the nations"</span> <span class="accented">might crone the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is illustrated by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "arrive at," or "accrue to," in <a href="/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>; <a href="/acts/25-15.htm">Acts 25:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>. For the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> we may also comp. <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>, "Unto (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) all and upon (<span class="greek">&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) all." By <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as the whole context shows, the apostle means in particular "the Gentiles," the non-Jews, as such. At the same time, the <span class="accented">phrase</span> is evidently used, as found ready at hand in the passage cited by him in ver. 8, "In thee shall all the nations (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) be blessed," which passage also suggested the notion of "the blessing of Abraham." It had therein been foretold that all the nations should, by exercising the faith of Abraham, obtain the same blessing; and (says the apostle) we see now by what method the benefit has been brought to them. "In Christ Jesus;" not merely <span class="accented">by</span> him; the blessing is, so to speak, immanent in Christ. both procured by him and obtained by the nations through their coming by faith into union with him. Comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 7</a>, "His grace which he freely bestowed upon us <span class="accented">in</span> the Beloved; in whom we have our redemption;" <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>, "In him ye are made full;" and the like. "The blessing of Abraham." The expression, being drawn from the passages in Genesis in which the Lord assures Abraham that "he would bless him," and that "in him all nations should be blessed," must be taken to import the Divine good will and whatever benefits would therefrom result. Men arrive at t is "benediction" by being justified; but justification is only the entrance into it, and not the whole blessing itself. It is styled <span class="accented">Abraham's</span> blessing, as having been emphatically declared to have been possessed by the patriarch, "the father" of all who should thereafter receive it<span class="cmt_word">. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). The pronoun "we" points, not to the Israelites as such, nor to Israelite believers in particular, but to those who were viewed as God's covenant people. These had hitherto been Abraham's natural seed only; and had also hitherto been under the Law. But the time had come when they were to receive the full "adoption of sons," and therewith the Spirit of God's Son (<a href="/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5, 6</a>); which, however, could not come to pass until the Law, "the yoke of slavery," had been cleared out of the way, opening the gate to God's benediction to all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. The Law and the Spirit could not coexist. Where the Law had sway, <span class="accented">there</span> was tutor-ship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) and slavery. Such, it is true, was needed, so long as the Spirit was not there; for moral beings, forming a people of God's, must be under <span class="accented">some</span> Law; and, if there was not a law written on the "fleshy tables of the heart" by God's Spirit, there behoved to be one embodied in an outward code of ordinances, which should coerce men's frowardness and keep them under discipline. But when this outward code had been taken out of the way," nailed to Christ's cross," then the people of God could not be left without the Spirit - the Spirit of holiness, as well as, or rather, because also, the Spirit of adoption; which accordingly was forthwith imparted, the sole condition of the bestowment being their living obedient faith, felt and by baptism professed, in Christ and in God. Comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13-18</a>, as containing a full presentment of these facts relative to the introduction of the new covenant, and in the same order of sequence. Thus the apostle has triumphantly returned to the thesis from which he had started in the two first verses of the chapter - Christ crucified, and the receiving of the Spirit without works of the Law. "The promise of the Spirit" is the Spirit which had been promised; the word "promise" here denoting, not as in <a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>, the word assuring a subsequent bestowment, but as in <a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>, the bestowment itself. The apostle points not merely to such passages of the Old Testament as had definitely fore-announced the outpouring of God's Spirit (Joel 2:38; <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; and the like), but the whole "kingdom of God," or "world to come," whose blessedness therewith came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He redeemed us] in order that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
