By using "it is written," Paul underscores the authority and permanence of the Scriptures, a common practice in Jewish teaching and early Christian writings. This phrase connects the New Testament teachings with the Old Testament, showing continuity in God's plan.<p><b>that Abraham had two sons</b><br>Abraham, a central figure in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, is known as the father of faith. His two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, represent two different covenants and paths. Ishmael, born to Hagar, and Isaac, born to Sarah, are pivotal in understanding the fulfillment of God's promises. This reference highlights the historical and theological significance of Abraham's lineage in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>one by the slave woman</b><br>The "slave woman" refers to Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant. In <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>, Sarah, unable to bear children, gives Hagar to Abraham to produce an heir. This act, though culturally acceptable at the time, was outside God's promise to Abraham and Sarah. Hagar's status as a slave emphasizes the theme of bondage and human effort, contrasting with the freedom and divine promise associated with Sarah.<p><b>and the other by the free woman</b><br>The "free woman" is Sarah, Abraham's wife, who bore Isaac. Despite her initial barrenness, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham through Sarah, demonstrating His power and faithfulness. Isaac's birth was miraculous, occurring when both Abraham and Sarah were advanced in age. This highlights the theme of divine intervention and grace, contrasting with the human effort seen in Hagar's story. Isaac, as the child of promise, prefigures the freedom and inheritance believers receive through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch in the Bible, considered the father of faith.

Ishmael, born to a slave through human effort, pictures bondage under law. Isaac, born to a free woman through divine promise, pictures the freedom and inheritance granted by grace through faith.

Attention has been drawn to other sons born of Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1, 2</a>), who both in ancient and in modern days (see Windisch-mann) have been very plausibly interpreted as analogously pointing forward allegorically to those heretical bodies, now vanished, which threatened such danger to the Church in the first centuries. But the apostle's concern here is exclusively with the posture of affairs subsisting at the time of Hagar's and Ishmael's expulsion from the patriarch's family, quoted in ver. 30 from <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. Even if he had seen fit by allegorical exposition to apply Scripture to those dire forms of utterly perverted Christianity, which he certainly did look forward to as about to arise, it is very questionable whether he would have conceded to them so venerable a parentage as having Abraham for their forefather. Mosaism in its place was a thing of Divine origin, even as Christianity itself was, both of them "covenants" of God; not so the monstrous forms of Gnostic and Manichean teaching which horrified the primitive Church. In fact, typology, that is to say, the interpretation of Old Testament Scripture as bearing a <span class="accented">designed</span> allegorical sense, requires very cautious handling. The tracing of analogies is an interesting and pleasing exercise of theological ingenuity; but it is one thing to trace a parallelism, and a quite different thing to detect a latent predictive sense intended by the Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">The one by a bondmaid</span> (<span class="greek_word">e%na e)k th = paidi/skh</span>); <span class="accented">one by the handmaid</span>; the expression pointing to the individual mother known from the sacred history. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in classical Greek means a girl either slave or free. In the Septuagint it is generally a slave (not, however, in <a href="/ruth/4-12.htm">Ruth 4:12</a>, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">na'arah</span>); in the New Testament it is always a maidservant. St. Paul borrows the word from the Septuagint of <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>. and 21, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">shiphehah.</span> Hagar was the personal property of Sarah. <span class="cmt_word">The other by a freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and one by the freewoman.</span> The word "freewoman" is never applied to Sarah in the story in Genesis; not even in the passage freely quoted in ver. 30; but it was an obviously true description, and with perfect fairness introduced in antithesis to Hagar. As applied to one holding so princessly a position in the story as Sarah, the idea of a freewoman stands coloured with a deep tincture of dignity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
