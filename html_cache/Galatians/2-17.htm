Justification refers to being declared righteous before God, not by works of the law but through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>). The context here is Paul's argument against the Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile Christians must follow Jewish law to be justified. This pursuit of justification in Christ alone is foundational to the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>we ourselves are found to be sinners,</b><br>Paul acknowledges the reality of sin even among believers. This reflects the ongoing struggle with sin that Christians face, despite being justified (<a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14-25</a>). The acknowledgment of sin does not negate the believer's justified status but highlights the need for continual reliance on Christ's righteousness. This also connects to the concept of sanctification, the process of becoming more like Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>does that make Christ a minister of sin?</b><br>Here, Paul anticipates a potential misunderstanding of the gospel of grace. The rhetorical question challenges the notion that Christ promotes sin by justifying sinners. This addresses the accusation that grace might encourage moral laxity (<a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>). The term "minister" implies service or agency, and Paul refutes any suggestion that Christ's work leads to sinfulness.<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul's emphatic rejection of the idea that Christ could be associated with sin underscores the holiness and purity of Jesus. This strong denial aligns with the consistent biblical portrayal of Christ as sinless (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) and the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). The phrase reinforces the transformative power of the gospel, which calls believers to live in righteousness, empowered by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of justification and the role of the law in the life of believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were struggling with the influence of Judaizers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating that Gentile Christians must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision, to be truly saved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the discussion, as Paul emphasizes justification through faith in Christ rather than adherence to the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Cephas)</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter, his actions in Antioch prompted Paul to address the issue of justification and the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justification_by_faith_alone.htm">Justification by Faith Alone</a></b><br>Emphasize that our justification is through faith in Christ, not by works of the law.

The tiny phrase &#8220;But if&#8221; sets up a hypothetical objection: What if, after leaving the law behind and trusting Christ, something goes wrong? It&#8217;s Paul&#8217;s way of stepping into the critic&#8217;s shoes, similar to <a href="/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3&#8211;4</a>, where he entertains a &#8220;what if&#8221; to dismantle it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while we seek to be justified in Christ</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Seek&#8221; indicates a deliberate, ongoing pursuit; our confidence rests in Jesus&#8217; finished work (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Justified in Christ&#8221; means declared righteous solely through His cross, not our performance (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; This is the same gospel Peter affirmed earlier (<a href="/acts/15-11.htm">Acts 15:11</a>), so Paul is not introducing anything novel&#8212;he is defending the heart of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we ourselves are found to be sinners</b><p>&#8226; Even redeemed believers still stumble (<a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8&#8211;9</a>).

But if, with all our seeking, something more was needed: viz., a rigid performance of the Law--that Law which we had abandoned--then there was still something wanting to our justification. We were sinners on a par with the Gentiles, and all that Christianity seemed to have done for us was to lead us deeper into sin. A profane thought!<p><span class= "bld">By Christ.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">in Christ</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by the relation into which we are brought with Him. The reference is here, however, not exactly to the mystical union with Christ, which is regarded by the Apostle rather in connection with sanctification (the actual growth in holiness) than with justification (the judicial absolution from guilt). In the present instance the Apostle is speaking of justification; and when he says that "we are justified in Christ," he means practically through faith in Him, or through that circle of forces within which we are brought by faith.<p><span class= "bld">We ourselves also.</span>--We who were by our birth Jews, as well as the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Are</span> <span class= "bld">found.</span>--Strictly, w<span class= "ital">ere found</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> at a time subsequent to our embracing Christianity, if the only <span class= "ital">result</span> of our Christianity was that we were still sinners.<p><span class= "bld">Sinners.</span>--Sinners actually, through our positive transgressions, and sinners theoretically or judicially (in the eyes of God), through the fact that we have lost the old Jewish justification through the fulfilment of the Law; while, according to this Judaising theory which St. Paul is combating, our new Christian justification is insufficient.<p><span class= "bld">Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</span>--Our English version is probably right in making this a question. It is put ironically, and as a sort of <span class= "ital">reductio ad absurdum</span> of the Judaising position. The Judaisers maintained the necessity of a strict fulfilment of the Mosaic law. They, however, still called themselves Christians; and here St. Paul had a hold upon them. "You call yourselves Christians," he says, "and yet you insist upon the Mosaic law. You say that a man cannot be justified without it: it follows that we, who have exchanged the service of the Law for the service of Christ, are not justified. In other words, our relation to Christ has made us, not better, but worse--a thought which no Christian can entertain."<p>No doubt St. Paul used some such argument as this in his controversy with St. Peter at Antioch, but it would probably be stated in a simpler and less speculative form: "If you still fall back upon the separatist Jewish observances, what is the good of being a Christian?" Here, in writing to the Galatians, the Apostle paraphrases what he had said in language more suited to a theological treatise and to the natural speculative bias of his own mind.<p><span class= "bld">God forbid.</span>--The Judaising theory was quite sufficiently condemned by showing the consequences to which it would lead. It makes Christ Himself a minister of sin--a suggestion which the Apostle puts away with pious horror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">but if while seeking to be justified in Christ.</span> The present participle, "while seeking," that is," while we sought," is referred back to the time indicated in the words, "we believed," of the preceding verse - the time, that is, when, made aware that works of the Law could not justify, they, Cephas and Paul, severally set themselves to find righteousness in Christ. At that time they in heart utterly renounced the notion that "works of the Law" had any effect upon a man's standing before God; they saw that his doing them could not make him righteous, as well as that his not doing them would not make him a sinner (see <a href="/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>). This was an essential feature of their state of mind in seeking righteousness in Christ. They distinguished Levitical purity and pollution from spiritual and real. And the principle was not only embraced in their hearts, but, in course of time, it embodied itself also, as occasion served, in outward deed. They, both Paul and Cephas himself, were bold to "live after the manner of Gentiles" (ver. 14), and with Gentiles to freely associate. If this was wrong, it was most heinously wrong; for it would be nothing short of a presumptuous setting at nought of God's own Law by which they flagrantly proved themselves to be, in a fatal and damning sense, <span class="accented">sinners.</span> But it was by the gospel that they had been led to think thus and to act thus; in other words, by Christ himself. Would it not, then, follow that Christ was a minister to them, not of righteousness, but of sin, of damning guilt? The participle "seeking" does not merely mark the time at which they were found to be sinners, but also and indeed much more, the course of conduct by which they proved themselves such. The words, "in Christ," are not equivalent to "through Christ," though the former idea includes the latter; the preposition is used in the same sense as in the sentences, "In God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>); "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>); "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). It denotes a state of intimate association, union, with Christ, involving justification by necessary consequence. Comp. <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, "That I may be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">We ourselves also are found sinners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">we ourselves also were found sinners.</span> The word "found" hints a certain measure of surprise (comp. <a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>; <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="/romans/7-21.htm">Romans 7:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). Cephas was behaving now as if to his painful surprise he had found himself to have been previously acting m a most guilty manner. The word "sinners" appears to denote more than the state of ceremonial uncleanness incurred by violating the prescriptions of Levitical purity; indeed, it meant more even as used by thorough-going ceremonialists (as in ver. 15); it points to the gross outrage which would in the case supposed have been put upon the majesty of God's Law. In the next verse "transgressor" is used as a convertible term. "Ourselves also" - as truly as any Gentile of them all. There is a touch of sarcasm in the clause, having a covert reference to St. Peter having turned his back upon his Gentile brethren as unfit for him to associate with; he thereby was treating <span class="accented">them</span> as "sinners." <span class="cmt_word">Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">is Christ a minister of sin</span>? <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is found in the New Testament besides only in <a href="/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a> and <a href="/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30</a>, in both which passages it simply propounds a question, without indicating whether the answer is expected to be negative or affirmative. So Soph., ' (Ed. T.,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; The inference here is so shocking that the apostle is unwilling to put it forward except as a question that might fairly be asked <span class="accented">upon such premisses.</span> This gives the sentence a less repulsive tone than the reading, which without an interrogative puts it thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). "Abhorred be the thought!" we both say; but (the apostle means his interlocutor to understand) since it cannot without horrid impiety be said that Christ was a minister to us of sin and not of righteousness, it follows of necessity that we did <span class="accented">not</span> sin against God when we set the works of the Law aside and sought righteousness in Christ alone without any respect had to them. The Greek phrase is one of several renderings which the Septuagint gives to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chali'lah</span>, <span class="accented">ad profana</span>, which is frequently used interjectionally to relegate some thought to the category of what is utterly abhorrent and polluted. The Hebrew word is discussed fully in Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in verb.</span> St. Paul uses the Greek phrase twice again in this Epistle (once absolutely, Galatians 3:21, and once inweaved in a sentence, Galatians 6:14); ten times absolutely in his Epistle to the Romans (3, 4, 6, etc.). It occurs also <a href="/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>. It is impossible to mend the vigorous rendering of our Authorized Version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
