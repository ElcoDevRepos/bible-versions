In the biblical context, it signifies Christ's sacrificial death, which frees believers from the curse and demands of the Mosaic Law. Historically, the Law was given to Israel as a covenant, setting them apart as God's people. However, it also highlighted humanity's inability to achieve righteousness through their own efforts. The Law served as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), showing the need for a savior. Jesus, by fulfilling the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), redeems those who were under its jurisdiction, offering freedom from its penalties and requirements. This redemption is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would bear the iniquities of many.<p><b>that we might receive our adoption as sons</b><br>Adoption in the Roman world, which Paul was familiar with, was a legal act that granted an adopted child the full rights and privileges of a biological child, including inheritance rights. Spiritually, this adoption signifies believers' new identity and relationship with God through Christ. It is not merely a change in status but a transformation into the family of God, with all the associated rights and responsibilities. This adoption is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), and it is echoed in other New Testament passages such as <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>, which speaks of believers receiving the Spirit of sonship. This adoption assures believers of their place in God's family, providing them with a sense of belonging and security, and it is made possible through the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia to correct false teachings and affirm the true gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christian communities in the region of Galatia, struggling with the influence of Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of redemption and adoption, whose sacrificial death and resurrection made it possible for believers to be redeemed from the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites and served as a guardian until Christ came.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoption_as_sons.htm">Adoption as Sons</a></b><br>A key theme in this verse, highlighting the transformation from being under the law to becoming children of God through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_from_the_law.htm">Redemption from the Law</a></b><br>Jesus' mission was to redeem us from the bondage of the law, which we could not fulfill on our own.

But why, in order to effect this object, was it prerequisite, as it is here implied that it was, that he should be himself "brought under the Law"? The directions which the Law in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a> gave with respect to those "hanged on a tree" were apparently held by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 27</a>) to apply also to the case of persons so hanged who were not Israelites. If so, does it not follow (an objector may say) that Jesus, even if not an Israelite under the Law, would, however, by being crucified, have fallen under the curse of the Law, and thereby annihilated the Law for all who by faith should become partakers with him, whether Jews or Gentiles? why, then, should be have been brought under the Law? The objection is met by the consideration that, in order that Christ might abrogate the Law by becoming subject to its curse, it was necessary that he should himself be perfectly acceptable to God, not only as being the eternal "Son of his love," but also in the entire completeness of his life as a man, and, therefore, by perfect obedience to the will of God as declared in the Law, under which it had pleased God to place his people. The Law, whatever the degradation which its ceremonial institute inferred for "the sons of God" subjected to it, was, nevertheless, for the time, God's manifest ordinance, to which all who sought to serve him were bound to submit them&deg; selves. They could not be righteous before him unless they walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless (<a href="/luke/1-6.htm">Luke 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might</span> <span class="cmt_word">receive the adoption of sons</span> (<span class="greek_word">i%na th\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, that our adoptive sonship might be actually and in full measure made over to us. The" we" recites God's people; the same persons as those indicated by the preceding phrase, "those which were under the Law," which phrase was not meant to define one particular class among God's people, but to describe the condition in which God's people had been placed. Their Father had put them under the Law with the view of their being at his appointed time bought off from the Law and admitted to the full enjoyment of their filial privileges. This purpose of their Father, signified beforehand in the promises to Abraham, explains the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: it was the adoptive sonship which had been guaranteed to them.
