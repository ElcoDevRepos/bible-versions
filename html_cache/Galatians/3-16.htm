These promises include land, descendants, and blessings (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:5-7, 17:4-8). The term "seed" (Hebrew: "zera") is significant, as it can mean both a singular and collective noun, indicating both a specific descendant and a multitude. The promises to Abraham are pivotal in understanding the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as they set the stage for the coming of the Messiah and the inclusion of the Gentiles into God's family (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>).<p><b>The Scripture does not say, &#8220;and to seeds,&#8221; meaning many,</b><br>Paul emphasizes the singular form of "seed" to highlight the specificity of the promise. This interpretation aligns with Jewish exegetical methods that pay close attention to the details of the text. The distinction between "seed" and "seeds" underscores the idea that the promise was not just to Abraham's numerous descendants (the nation of Israel) but pointed to a particular individual. This interpretation is crucial for understanding the unity and continuity of God's plan through a single line leading to Christ.<p><b>but &#8220;and to your seed,&#8221; meaning One,</b><br>The singular "seed" is identified as one person, which Paul clarifies as Christ. This interpretation is consistent with the messianic expectations found throughout the Old Testament, where a singular figure is often prophesied to bring about God's ultimate salvation (e.g., <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>). The focus on "One" highlights the centrality of Christ in God's redemptive history, fulfilling the promises made to Abraham and serving as the mediator of the new covenant.<p><b>who is Christ.</b><br>Paul identifies Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham's "seed." This connection is foundational for understanding the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Christ's role as the "seed" signifies the culmination of God's promises, bringing blessings to all nations through His life, death, and resurrection. This interpretation reinforces the unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in God's plan of salvation, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a> and <a href="/luke/3-34.htm">Luke 3:34</a>, which trace Jesus' lineage back to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch in the Bible, to whom God made significant promises, including the promise of a seed through whom all nations would be blessed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The promised "seed" of Abraham, through whom the blessings of God are fulfilled and extended to all nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, explaining the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in Asia Minor where the recipients of Paul's letter lived, dealing with issues of law and grace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise.htm">The Promise</a></b><br>Refers to the covenantal promises God made to Abraham, which are central to understanding the fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_singular_seed.htm">The Singular Seed</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the singular "seed" to highlight that the promise was always intended to be fulfilled in one person, Christ.

He promised Abraham that blessing would come through a single Seed&#8212;Christ. By trusting in Him, we share Abraham&#8217;s promises, enjoy God&#8217;s acceptance, and stand secure in a covenant that can never be broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) A parenthetical explanation of the true object of the promise. That promise was shown by its wording to have reference to the Messiah. It did not speak of "seeds," but of "seed"--not of "descendants," but of "descendant." And the Messiah is, <span class= "ital">par excellence,</span> the "descendant" of Abraham.<p>The object of this parenthesis is to prove a point which the Judaising opponents of the Apostle would not contest--viz., that the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham was reserved for that Messianic dispensation to which they themselves belonged. The Law therefore <span class= "ital">intervened,</span> between the promise and its fulfilment, but, inasmuch as it was itself <span class= "ital">later</span> than the promise, could not alter the terms of its fulfilment. If the promise had been fulfilled <span class= "ital">before</span> the giving of the Law, and if the Messianic dispensation to which the Apostle and his readers belonged was <span class= "ital">not</span> a fulfilment of the promise, then the Law might have had something to do with it: the restrictions of the Law might have come in to limit and contract the promise: the Gentiles might have been saddled with the obligations of the Jews. But it was not so.<p><span class= "bld">To Abraham and his seed were the promises made.</span>--It was expressly stated that the promises were given "to Abraham and his seed." The exact terms are worth noting.<p>The quotation appears to be made from <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm" title="For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.">Genesis 13:15</a>, or <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm" title="And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.">Genesis 17:8</a>. The word "promise" is put in the plural because the promise to Abraham was several times repeated--to Abraham first, and, after him, to the other patriarchs. The object of the promise, as recorded in the Book of Genesis, was, in the first instance, the possession of the land of Canaan; but St. Paul here, as elsewhere, gives it a spiritual application.<p><span class= "bld">He saith not.</span>--The "he" is not expressed. We must supply either "God" or the promise given by God--"it says," as in quotations from an authoritative document.<p><span class= "bld">And to seeds, as of many; but as of one.</span>--The argument of the Apostle turns upon the use, both in the Hebrew and in the LXX., of a singular instead of a plural noun. Both in the Hebrew and in the LXX., however, the noun, though singular, is collective. It meant, in the first instance at least, not any one individual, but the posterity of Abraham as a whole. The Apostle refers it to Christ and the "spiritual Israel" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Church, of which He is the Head), on the same principle on which, throughout the New Testament, the history of the chosen people under the old covenant is taken as a type of the Christian dispensation. We may compare <a href="/matthew/2-15.htm" title="And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.">Matthew 2:15</a>, where an allusion to the exodus of Israel from Egypt is treated as a type of the return of the Holy Family from their flight into Egypt. Such passages are not to be regarded as <span class= "ital">arguments</span> possessing a permanent logical validity (which would be to apply the rigid canons of Western logic to a case for which they are unsuitable), but rather as marked illustrations of the organic unity which the apostolic writers recognised in the pre-Christian and Christian dispensations. Not only had both the same Author, and formed part of the same scheme, but they were actually the counterparts one of the other. The events which characterised the earlier dispensation had their analogies--sometimes spiritual, sometimes literal--in the later. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">now to Abraham were the promises made</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">spoken</span>) <span class="accented">and to his seed.</span> The question now to be determined is, who the parties were that were concerned in the covenant made with Abraham, and with respect to whom the principle just stated must be taken to apply. Of course, God is himself one of the two parties. This the apostle assumes without specific mention in this verse, though he refers to it in the next. On the other side, he discerns "Abraham <span class="accented">and his seed</span>;" for the form of the sentence, we feel, lays emphatic stress upon the latter copartner. He has in view, apparently, in part, the promise recorded in <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>, "All the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever;" perhaps in part the vision related in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, wherein (ver. 18) "the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land," etc.; but most particularly, since on this occasion circumcision was appointed as the "sign of the covenant," the words in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7, 8</a>, "I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee: and I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God." In the present connection the reference is not so obvious to the important promise in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>, on which such stress is laid in <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>. These passages, in their primary and plain obvious sense, point to a covenant established by the Lord between himself on the one hand, and Abraham and Abraham's natural seed on the other; ratified on the persons of Abraham and his offspring by the seal of circumcision, and collating to them the gift of the laud of Canaan. But the apostle teaches us to read these passages mystically: in place of Abraham's natural seed substituting "Christ," a spiritual seed; and in place of the land of Canaan substituting a spiritual inheritance. For "covenant," to which term the apostle reverts in the next verse, we have here "promises;" thus also in <a href="/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a>, Abraham is described as "he that had the promises." <span class="cmt_word">He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, as meaning "of," not found elsewhere in the New Testament, occurs repeatedly in Plato (see Ellicott and Alford, and Winer's 'Gram.,' 47, g). With "many" and "one," we are, of course, to supply "seeds" and "seed." It has been questioned whether such a form of expression as "to thy seeds" would have been possible in the Hebrew. Certainly we do not in the Hebrew Bible find a plural of the noun <span class="accented">zera</span> when used for "offspring," but only when used for a grain of seed. But still, such a plural may not have been unknown to St. Paul in the Hebrew spoken in his time; for it occurs, De Wette tells us, in the Chaldee Paraphrast for "races" in <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>. Such a grammatical cavil to his observation, however, the apostle might well have brushed aside by giving his objector to understand that it was not upon a nicety of lingual criticism that he was taking his stand, but upon a fact which was not to be called in question; namely, that of the many branches of descendants owning Abraham as their progenitor, there was only one contemplated by the Almighty as destined to inherit the promise. This principle of discrimination among several lines of descendants he has himself drawn marked attention to in <a href="/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7, 8</a>, by quoting the words, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," and adding the gloss, "That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed." And so here. Among Abraham's descendants one particular head of a race was beforehand selected in the counsels of God, whose issue alone should inherit. As the principle of discriminative predestination was applied with respect to the inheriting of the promises viewed in their secular meaning, so also was it applied with respect to the inheriting of them spiritually: to only one branch of Abraham's descendants did the Divine Disposer guarantee the promised grant; <span class="accented">that</span> which should originate from Abraham's great Descendant, Christ, and which was to be in him and by his name to be called. Which is Christ (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); that is, which seed is Christ; the gender of the relative pronoun, which logically, as reciting a neuter noun, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, should be neuter, being according to a very common usage of the language made masculine by the attraction of the predicate <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The word "seed" still retains its signification of a collective noun, and does not even here denote a single descendant - a sense which usage would not justify us in assigning to it; for even in <a href="/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a> <span class="accented">zera</span> <span class="accented">acher</span> means "other offspring," and not "another offspring." The word "Christ" is itself employed by the apostle as a collective, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>, "Christ is divided!" or, "Is Christ divided?" <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, "As the body is one, and hath many members... . so also is Christ." It is usual in the Hebrew idiom to apply to a people the very name, unmodified, of the head from which they derive; as "Israel," "Jacob," "Ephraim," "Judah," and a large multitude of instances. It is certain from vers. 27-29 that St. Paul has in view those who are "in Christ" as being in and with him the "seed" to whom the "inheritance" was by that covenant given. Jesus, viewed in his own solitary personality, has no place in the apostle's present argument: <span class="accented">he</span> it was not that was to inherit the blessing, save only with, or rather in, that multitude of human beings for whose sake he is there at all. Perhaps it is on that account that his official title "Christ" is alone named, in preference to "Jesus" his appellation as an individual man. Having thus ascertained as definitely as we may what it is that the apostle here states, we are naturally led to consider on what grounds he is justified in affixing to the passage or passages of the Old Testament which he refers to, the sense that he does; both as to the import of the gift which the covenant guaranteed to Abraham's seed and as to the specific seed itself as being" Christ." The answer to such questioning is, for us, at once in a great measure determined by our belief in the claims which St. Paul makes to be regarded as an inspired teacher. With this belief, we do not wait first to ascertain that his exposition is warranted by linguistic or historical reasoning before we will give it our assent. We accept his exposition as one imparted to himself by heavenly teaching, and as the result of inspired spiritual insight gazing into the oracles of God. We refuse to regard it, as some would fain persuade us to do, as mere <span class="accented">midrash</span> of unscientific rabbinism. Perhaps, indeed, rabbinism itself in its better schools - and in such St. Paul had himself in his earlier years been trained - was often far more profound and scientific in its scriptural exegesis than many who have not been conversant with Jewish commentators are disposed to imagine. His exposition is, therefore, not at once and of course condemned, because, if indeed it be the fact, its <span class="accented">method</span> seems to bear upon it the brand of being rabbinical. Thus much is clear - its <span class="accented">substance</span> was beyond all question <span class="accented">not</span> drawn from rabbinism, but learnt from higher teaching. If at first it arouses in our minds a feeling of surprise, and even a degree of hesitation in accepting it as it lies there before us, we may have good grounds for suspecting that this is owing, not to our superior wisdom, but to the superficiality of the views which we are in the habit of taking of the histories and utterances found in the Old Testament. Fuller and clearer insight into the depths of inspired teaching will perhaps enable us by-and-by to grasp with a firmer hold than now the veritable reasonableness and certainty of this apostolic word, and to discern its coherency with other portions of revealed truth. Meanwhile it may conciliate our judgment to a more unfaltering acceptance at once of what we here read, if we will consider how transcendently great is the glory of the personage whose Name is here attached to Abraham's spiritual seed, and how transcendent too is the corresponding glory of that economy of benediction which that august Being has brought in. The infinite grandeur of "God manifest in the flesh" imparts its magnificence both to the community which he graciously takes into union with him, and to the "kingdom of God" which through him they inherit. The glory of Christ fills the whole Church, which, resplendent therewith, eclipses into utter obscurity all other communities heretofore promised to be recipient of Divine blessing: those, feeble types of her, fade away at her coming, their glory and very being absorbed in hers. We need, then, not hesitate to believe that she with her Lord was from the beginning contemplated by the Almighty in the revelations of future benediction which he accorded to men, certainly with a view ultimately to this crowning dispensation; and that anterior dispensations of benediction were symbolically predictive of this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
