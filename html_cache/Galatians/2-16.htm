In the context of first-century Judaism, the "works of the law" referred to the observance of the Mosaic Law, including rituals, dietary laws, and circumcision. Paul argues that these works cannot justify a person before God. This teaching contrasts with the Judaizers' belief that Gentile Christians must adhere to Jewish law to be saved. The concept of justification by faith alone is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, echoing the teachings of the Old Testament prophets like <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, "the righteous will live by his faith."<p><b>but by faith in Jesus Christ</b><br>Faith in Jesus Christ is presented as the sole means of justification. This faith is not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust and reliance on Christ's atoning work on the cross. The phrase underscores the New Covenant, where Jesus fulfills the law and prophets, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>. This faith aligns with the Abrahamic covenant, where Abraham was justified by faith before the law was given (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus</b><br>Paul includes himself and his fellow Jewish Christians, indicating that even those who were under the law have come to faith in Christ. This belief is a personal and communal act, signifying a shift from reliance on the law to trust in Christ. It reflects the early church's struggle to define the role of the law in light of Christ's fulfillment of it, as discussed in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>that we may be justified by faith in Christ</b><br>The repetition of justification by faith highlights its importance. Justification is a legal term, signifying a declaration of righteousness. In the Greco-Roman world, this would resonate as a courtroom verdict. Paul emphasizes that this justification is available to all who believe, Jew and Gentile alike, breaking down the dividing wall of hostility (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>and not by works of the law</b><br>Paul reiterates the inadequacy of the law for justification. The law's purpose was to reveal sin and point to the need for a savior (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). This statement challenges the prevailing Jewish thought and underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which transcends cultural and religious boundaries.<p><b>because by works of the law no one will be justified</b><br>This conclusion reinforces the universal need for faith in Christ. It echoes <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, where David acknowledges that no one living is righteous before God. The law serves as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), but it is only through Christ's sacrifice that true righteousness is imparted.

This condition could not be produced by works done in obedience to the Law.<p><span class= "bld">But.</span>--The sense of the Greek is not clearly brought out by the Authorised version. A more strict translation would be <span class= "ital">except,</span> which is made to refer only to the word "justified," and not to the previous negation of works, as the cause of justification. "A man is not justified by works (nor is he justified at all), <span class= "ital">except</span> by faith in Christ."<p><span class= "bld">By the faith of Jesus Christ.</span>--The preposition "by" occurs five times in this verse. In every case except the present it is represented by the same word in Greek. There is, however, no substantial difference of meaning; the only difference is that in the other cases stress is laid rather upon the <span class= "ital">cause,</span> here rather upon the <span class= "ital">means.</span> "Faith <span class= "ital">of</span> Jesus Christ" means, as we are more accustomed to say, "faith <span class= "ital">in</span> Jesus Christ."<p><span class= "bld">Even we.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">we too.</span> Jews as we are, in spite of all our privileges.<p><span class= "bld">Have believed.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">believed.</span> This was the great motive of our conversion. We found that the Law could not justify us and that Christ could.<p><span class= "bld">By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span>--This is a quotation for which no exact equivalent is to be found in the Old Testament. The nearest appears to be <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm" title="And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.">Psalm 143:2</a> : "In thy sight shall no man living be justified." This, as written under the dispensation of the Law, naturally applied to that dispensation, so that the Apostle was justified in adding "by the works of the Law." The same quotation, in the same words, is made in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>.<p>The inability of the Law to justify comes out in two ways. (1) The only way in which the Law could justify was through a complete obedience to its provisions. But it was impossible to render a <span class= "ital">complete</span> obedience to it: and to offend in one point was "to be guilty of all;" so that practically, as a matter of fact, no one was justified by it. (2) Nor did it <span class= "ital">help</span> men to justify themselves. It was something dead and lifeless--a mere written letter, possessing none of those "means of grace" which are offered by Christianity.

The variation of the proposition, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> in this clause for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in the preceding clause, we find again in <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, "Not having a righteousness which is mine own, that which is (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) of the Law [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> derived from the Law], but that which is (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) through faith of Christ." That no real difference is here intended in the sense is shown by the use immediately after of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in the clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. For the apostle's present argument it is immaterial whether we are said to gain righteousness <span class="accented">through</span> faith or <span class="accented">from</span> it.

Renouncing all thought of gaining righteous<span class="accented">ness</span> by (or from) doing works of the Law, we fixed our faith upon Christ, in order to gain righteousness by (or from) believing in him. The form of expression does not determine the time when they expected to become righteous; but the whole complexion of the argument points to their justification following immediately upon their believing in Christ. That full recognition of fellow-believers, which is the hinge on which the discussion turns, presupposes their being already righteous through their faith. <span class="cmt_word">And not by the works of the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is added <span class="accented">ex abundanti</span>, to clench more strongly the affirmation that works of the Law have no effect in making men righteous. <span class="cmt_word">For by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> [or rather, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>). This simply repeats the affirmation in the first clause of the verse, with only an intensified positiveness; the future tense, "shall be justified," expressing, not the time at which the act of justification takes place, but the absoluteness of the rule that no human being is to expect ever to be justified by works of the Law. In <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> we have identically the same sentence with the addition of "in his sight." Instead, however, of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, found in that passage, many recent editors here give <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, there being no more difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, than between "because that" and "because." In both passages it looks as if the apostle meant to be understood as citing <span class="accented">a locus probativus</span>; and the addition of the words, "in his sight," in Romans indicates that the authoritative passage referred to is <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, which in the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, added in both, is a comment of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> own, founded as it should seem upon the case of the people of Israel, whom the psalmist manifestly included in his universal statement; those who had the Law yet lacked justification before God, every one; those even of them who more or less were doing its works. This verse, viewed as a statement of the individual experience of the two apostles Peter and Paul themselves, is verified with respect to the latter by the accounts given in the Acts of his conversion. With respect to St. Peter, its verification is supplied to the reflective student of the Gospels by his realizing the process of feeling through which that apostle's mind passed in the several situations thus indicated: "This day thou shalt deny me thrice;" "He went out and wept bitterly;" "Go and tell his disciples and Peter, he goeth before you into Galilee;" "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon;" "Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?" "They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." Further, the highly animated language with which, in their writings, each of these apostles - St. Paul, for instance, in the Romans (5. and 8.) and Ephesians, and St. Peter in several passages of his First Epistle - portrays the peace and exulting joy which Christ's disciples experience through faith in him, is evidently drawn from their own mental history. And this happy experience of theirs was, most palpably, in no degree whatever derived from works of the Law, but solely from the grace of Christ As St. Peter had recently intimated at Jerusalem, their hearts, as truly as the hearts of their fellow-believers of the Gentiles, "God had cleansed" from the sense of guilt and pollutedness before him "by faith" (<a href="/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>). It is necessary here to be quite clear as to the nature of those "works of the Law" which the apostle has now in his view. This is determined by the preceding context. The works of the Law now in question were those, the observance of which characterized a man's "living as do the Jews" and their non-observance a man's "living as do the Gentiles." It was the disregard of these works on the part of the Gentile believers which the Jewish Christians, whom St. Peter would fain stand well with, considered as disqualifying them from free association with themselves. So, again, when St. Peter was "living as do the Gentiles," he was viewed as setting at nought, not the moral precepts of the Law, but its positive ceremonial precepts only. It is the making that distinction between believers living as do the Gentiles and believers living as do the Jews, which Peter and the brethren from James were in effect making, that the apostle here sets himself so sternly to reprobate. It is with this view that he here asserts the principle that through faith in Christ a man is made righteous, and that through faith in Christ only can he be, these works having nothing whatever to do with it. "You Cephas," he says, "and I were living as do the Jews; no unclean sinners of Gentiles were we! And both you and I have been made righteous. And how? Not through those works of the Law, but through believing in Christ Jesus. And these Gentile brethren, from whom you are now shrinking back as if they were not good enough for us to associate with, - they believe in Christ as truly as we do; they are therefore as truly righteous as we are. It is absurd for you to try to thrust upon them those works of the Law; by the works of the Law can neither they be made righteous nor yet we. So neither, on the other hand, by disregarding the works of the Law can either they or we be made sinners." This last position, that the neglect of the works of the Law does not disqualify a fellow-Christian for brotherly recognition, is plainly essential to his present argument. But this is true only of the neglect of the positive Levitical precepts of the Law; the neglect of its moral precepts does disqualify him (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>). Does it not seem a just inference from this course of argument, that no man whom we have reason to believe to be justified by faith in Christ is to be refused either Christian association or Church fellowship? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eidotes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
