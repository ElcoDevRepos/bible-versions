This confidence is rooted in his faith in God's sovereignty and the work of the Holy Spirit among the believers. It reflects a common theme in Paul's letters, where he often places his trust in God's ability to sustain and guide the church (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>that you will take no other view.</b><br>Paul is addressing the Galatians' wavering due to false teachings. He is urging them to remain steadfast in the gospel he preached, which is centered on faith in Christ rather than adherence to the law. This reflects the broader context of the letter, where Paul combats the influence of Judaizers who were advocating for the necessity of following Jewish law for salvation (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>).<p><b>The one who is troubling you</b><br>Here, Paul refers to the agitators within the Galatian church who are causing confusion and leading believers astray. These individuals are likely the Judaizers, who insisted on circumcision and adherence to the Mosaic Law. This phrase highlights the internal conflict within the early church as it grappled with the integration of Gentile believers (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15:1-5</a>).<p><b>will bear the judgment,</b><br>Paul assures the Galatians that those causing division and teaching false doctrine will face divine judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God holds individuals accountable for leading others into error (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>). It underscores the seriousness of distorting the gospel message and the consequences that follow.<p><b>whoever he may be.</b><br>Paul's statement indicates that the identity of the troublemaker is less important than the fact that they will be judged. This emphasizes the impartiality of God's justice, where all are accountable regardless of status or position. It also serves as a warning to the Galatians to be discerning and not swayed by individuals who deviate from the true gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of false teachings and encouraging the believers to remain steadfast in the true gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were promoting a distorted version of the gospel, likely advocating for adherence to Jewish law as necessary for salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, in whom Paul places his confidence regarding the Galatians' faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine consequence that will befall those who lead others astray from the true gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_the_lord.htm">Confidence in the Lord</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereignty and His ability to preserve His people in truth.<br><br>Encourage believers to rely on the Lord's guidance rather than human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_against_false_teachings.htm">Discernment Against False Teachings</a></b><br>Be vigilant in identifying teachings that deviate from the gospel of Christ.<br><br>Equip oneself with scriptural knowledge to discern truth from error.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_and_judgment.htm">Accountability and Judgment</a></b><br>Understand that those who lead others astray will face divine judgment.<br><br>Emphasize the importance of teaching and living out the true gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_true_gospel.htm">Unity in the True Gospel</a></b><br>Foster unity among believers by adhering to the core truths of the faith.<br><br>Avoid divisions caused by false doctrines and focus on the essentials of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Galatians_5_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Galatians 5:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Galatians_5_10_Trust_in_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Galatians 5:10 encourage confidence in the Lord's guidance for believers?

The apostle has himself a vivid remembrance of their warm-hearted acceptance of his message (<a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-15</a>), and of their sufferings in the good cause (<a href="/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>). "Have confidence with respect to you." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in 2 Colossians 8:22, equivalently with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> in 2 <a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; in which last passage ("We have confidence in the Lord touching you" ), as well as in <a href="/philippians/2-24.htm">Philippians 2:24</a> ("I have confidence in the Lord that I myself shall come shortly" ), the phrase, "in the Lord," expresses, not the object of trust, but the sphere of consciousness in which he is able to feel this confidence. So also here, in the realized presence of the Lord Jesus, the apostle feels that his care for his people, and his faithfulness towards these in whom "he has begun a good work" so conspicuously as in their case, warrant him in entertaining a strong assurance that, after all, they would not disappoint his hopes (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>). This expression of confidence implies, of course, a measure of underlying apprehension; while it is also in effect an admonition, couched in an affectionate form, designed to rally them back to their true allegiance. The phrase, "with respect to you," separates their case from that of any who were "troubling them;" kindly implying that, in the main, they were still unperverted. <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye will be none otherwise minded</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti ou)de\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); that is, that your sentiments will continue, or will be found to be, such as I have been setting forth as those inspired by the gospel, and such as you once manifestly entertained. The future tense of the verb seems to point forward to the time when his appeal should have reached them, and have led them to bethink themselves as to what, in spite of perhaps some momentary superficial wavering, their sentiments at bottom really were. (For the sense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, comp. <a href="/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But he that troubleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but he that is troubling</span> you. "But;" indicating that, even if such a person's machinations proved abortive, through their steady adherence to the gospel, that man should receive his deserts none the less. In <a href="/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> we had "There are some that trouble you," Comparing the two expressions, the one in the singular number, the other in the plural, we may conclude, <span class="accented">either</span> that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> designates any one who shall be found falling under the description of a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any one of those referred to in the plural number; <span class="accented">or</span> that it points to one particular individual on whom the apostle had his eye as the prime ringleader of the rest. If we adopt the first view, the clause, "whosoever he be," appears to mark the absoluteness of the resolve expressed by the apostle, while leaving in indefiniteness the individual to whom it would apply. With the second view, the same clause would affirm that no circumstances attaching to the offender, such as (suppose) a mission from leading Churchmen in Jerusalem, or official eminence in a Galatian Church, or any other, should shield him, as he or others might suppose that it would, from the effect of the sentence to be pronounced upon him. The second seems the more probable view; and, in unison with it, it appears supposable that the hypothetical case stated in <a href="/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> ("if we or an angel from heaven" ) had an eye to the eminent position held by the person here alluded to. This individualization of the threatening would make it the more telling when the letter should arrive - a thunder-clap bursting forth upon the head of that arch-troubler. <span class="cmt_word">Shall bear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">judgment, whosoever he be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>).

"Shall bear," as a heavy burden (comp. <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2, 5</a>). The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> a shall be laid upon him, and carry it he shall, whether he will or no. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> judgment, is the "sentence;" the decision of the judge upon his conduct, and the consequent punishment. The apostle threatens that he will bring into exercise the "power" which, as he says in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>, the Lord had given him for the edification of his people, and the use of which would be accompanied by consequences proving that "Christ was speaking in him" (ibid., 2, 3). Instances of its exercise are seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>.
