In the context of Galatians, these individuals are likely the Judaizers, who were advocating for adherence to Jewish customs, such as circumcision, as necessary for salvation. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God emphasizes the importance of the heart over outward appearances, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>are trying to compel you to be circumcised.</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>) and became a central practice in Jewish identity. In the early church, there was significant debate over whether Gentile converts needed to adopt Jewish customs, including circumcision, to be true followers of Christ. The Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> addressed this issue, ultimately deciding that Gentile believers were not required to be circumcised. Paul's letter to the Galatians strongly argues against the necessity of circumcision for salvation, emphasizing faith in Christ alone (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>).<p><b>They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.</b><br>The cross of Christ represents the core of the Christian gospel, emphasizing salvation through faith in Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection. For early Christians, the cross was a symbol of shame and suffering, as crucifixion was a brutal form of Roman execution. By insisting on circumcision, the Judaizers were attempting to align Christianity more closely with Judaism, which was a legally recognized religion in the Roman Empire, thereby avoiding the persecution associated with the distinct and radical message of the cross. This reflects a broader biblical theme of suffering for the sake of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>, which states that all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of legalism and the true gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by Judaizers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group of Jewish Christians who insisted that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision, to be truly saved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cross_of_christ.htm">Cross of Christ</a></b><br>Central to Paul's message, representing the sacrifice of Jesus and the basis of salvation by faith, not by works.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical act required by Jewish law, symbolizing the old covenant, which some were wrongly insisting was necessary for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/outward_appearance_vs._inward_faith.htm">Outward Appearance vs. Inward Faith</a></b><br>The focus on outward religious acts, like circumcision, can detract from the true essence of faith in Christ.

Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>). The object of the Judaisers was by this means to keep in with their countrymen, the Jews, and even to gain favour amongst them by seeming to win over proselytes to the Mosaic law.<p><span class= "bld">Only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span>--What aroused the antagonism of the Jews against the Christians was evidently not so much the confession of the Messiahship of Jesus as the declared abolition of the Law of Moses. By suppressing this side of Christian teaching, the Judaisers could easily obtain toleration for their other tenets. If, on the other hand, they were to emphasise it, the full weight of persecution would fall upon them--its ostensible ground being the doctrine of a crucified Messiah. Accordingly, they persuaded as many of the Galatians as they could to accept circumcision, and made the most of this propagandist zeal to their Jewish neighbours.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">all those who wish to make a fair show in the flesh.</span> In this verse and the next the apostle singles out for especial animadversion certain Christians, Galatian Christians no doubt, who were actuated by the aim of standing fair with the religious world of Judaism. They were Gentile Christians and not Jews; this appears from their not themselves wishing to keep the Law; for if they had been Jews, the external observance of the Law, being natural to them from their infancy, would have been with them a matter of course: St. Paul himself would probably not have urged them to relinquish it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not found by the critics in any earlier Greek writer, though the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, fair-faced, is used of "specious" answers in Herodotus (7:168), and "specious words" conjoined with "fables" in Demosthenes ('De Corinthians,' p. 277). Aristophanes uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ('Nub.,' 362) to "<span class="accented">carry</span> a solemn and worshipful face." The notion of falsity, plainly hinted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, reminds us, Bishop Lightfoot observes, of our Lord's words respecting whited sepulchres, which "outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly," etc. (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, face, in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>, "<span class="accented">glory</span> in <span class="accented">appearance</span>, and not in heart." As the aorist of verbs denoting a certain state frequently expresses an entrance upon such a state (see <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> above, <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a> and note), it probably is intimated that the persons referred to were conscious that their "<span class="accented">outward</span> appearance" was hitherto not acceptable to Jewish minds, but that they now were desirous of making it so. Time had been when they did not care so much about it. "In the flesh." This word "flesh" not unfrequently designates men's condition as unmodified by the Spirit of God; as when the apostle speaks of "<span class="accented">being</span> in the flesh" (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8, 9</a>): thence also circumstances or relations pertaining to this unspiritual condition, as in <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3, 4</a>; where the apostle speaks of "having confidence in the flesh," and goes on, in vers. 5, 6, to enumerate some of those circumstances or relations. Thus, again, in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>, "ye, the Gentiles in the flesh," that is, who in that state of things in which men lived before the spiritual economy intervened, were the "uncircumcision (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)," while the Jews were the "<span class="accented">circumcision."</span> But as the distinction between these two classes was signalized by an external corporeal mark, the apostle in that passage immediately after uses the expression, "in the flesh," in a varied sense, with reference to this latter, "that which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands." With similar variation of meaning the word "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> is used here. The Christians spoken of, losing sight of the cross of Christ and the Spirit's work, were becoming possessed by feelings belonging to the old "<span class="accented">carnal"</span> relations between Jews and Gentiles, and so were making it their ambition to figure with advantage in the eyes of the circumcision, as well as to escape their enmity. And then, as in the passage just referred to (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>), the apostle passes from this sense of the phrase, "in the flesh," to another relating to corporeal flesh; for this he does in the next verse, in the words, "that they may glory in your flesh." <span class="cmt_word">They constrain you to be circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">these compel you to be circumcised.</span> "Compel;" the same verb as was used above (<a href="/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>) of St. Peter's attitude towards the Gentile believers at Antioch. <span class="accented">As here applied</span>, <span class="accented">it means</span> "<span class="accented">advise</span>," "<span class="accented">urge</span>," argue for it as right and necessary for salvation, insist upon it as a condition of friendship. "These;" not, perhaps, meaning "<span class="accented">these</span> only," "<span class="accented">none</span> but these;" it appears enough to suppose that the apostle, from definite information which he had received, was persuaded that some of those who took the lead in urging onward the Judaizing movement were led to join in it by the cowardly motives here described. With indignant scorn, he says," As surely as a man wants to stand well with the world, so surely will he be found with these circumcisers."<span class="cmt_word">Only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">only that they may not by means of the cross of Christ suffer persecution.</span> "Only that;" that is, for no other reason than that. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is thrust out of its proper position in the sentence (which is that assigned to it in the Textus Receptus) by the fervent of the writer's feelings. To himself the cross of Christ seemed the centre of all glory and blessedness; to be connected with it he would be well pleased to suffer martyrdom; but these men could be well content to shelve it out of sight, and, in fact, were doing so; and what for? because the Jews did not like it, and they did not wish to get into trouble by offending <span class="accented">them</span>! A grand disdain prompts the apostle, at the cost of impairing the smooth run of the sentence, to (as it were) balance against each other the "cross of Christ" and "not being persecuted." The construction of the dative to express "by means of," that by which a certain result is brought about, is not very common; but we have it in <a href="/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and ibid., 30, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. Our attention is in this passage again drawn to the manner in which the Jews regarded "the word of the cross" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>), as that "word" was unfolded by St. Paul and received by his disciples among the Gentiles. The great point of offence (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the apostle's teaching respecting it lay in his presenting its pollution in the view of the Law, as inferring the abrogation of the ceremonial institute itself. On this account the Jews could not abide him nor those who attached themselves to him as their teacher, though in a degree able to put up with Christians not anti-Judaists. To the Galatians he had presented "Christ crucified" (<a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>) as <span class="accented">he</span> saw him to be, and they had accepted the doctrine. But now some, at least, of them were beginning to feel uneasy at observing how the Jews in their neighbourhood regarded Paul and those who attached themselves closely to Paul. Had not the Jews (they felt) high claims to consideration? Were they not the original depositaries of the oracles of God? Was not their religion venerable for its antiquity, magnificent in its temple and ritual, and in origin Divine? To these new converts from the gross spiritual darkness and degradation of heathenism, some of them, perhaps, drawn from it originally by the teaching of non-Christian Jews, the adherents to the ancient faith would naturally appear entitled to high respect - respect which they themselves were also not backward in claiming (see <a href="/romans/2-19.htm">Romans 2:19, 20</a>). When the personal influence exercised upon their minds by the holy love and fervour of the apostle had through his absence begun to wane, they also, we may imagine, began to get disheartened, by feeling that their Christian discipleship was viewed with disfavour by their Jewish neighbours, by reason of its Pauline complexion; that on this account the Jews looked upon themselves, though worshippers of the same God, as unworthy of notice; nay, were even disposed to point them out to the surrounding heathens, only too willing to follow up the hint, as proper objects of contempt and ill usage (see for illustration, <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>; <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>; <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>). And herewith we have to bear in mind also that Judaism was in Roman jurisprudence treated as a tolerated religion (<span class="accented">religio licita</span>); and that, as long as Christians were regarded as belonging to a sect or branch of Judaism, they might seem to be entitled, in the eyes of Roman law, to the same toleration as the Jews themselves enjoyed. But if the Jews cast them off or disowned them they might forfeit such immunity, and become liable to be treated, not only by mobs, but by the Roman law itself, as offenders. The persons, then, here censured by the apostle may be supposed to have pursued the course they did with the idea that, by making themselves acceptable to the Jews through the adoption to a limited extent of Jewish ceremonies, and especially through the acceptance in their own person and the urging upon others of circumcision, they would relieve themselves of "the offence of the cross" (ch. 5:4). Without ceasing to be Christians, they would wipe themselves clear of the odium which with the Jews attached to Paul and those who held with Paul. Such seems to be the situation to which St. Paul's words allude. Bishop Lightfoot interprets it somewhat differently. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/6-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Those who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hosoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
