In the cultural context of the time, it was not uncommon for a barren wife to offer her maidservant to her husband to bear children on her behalf. This practice is documented in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>. Ishmael's birth was a result of human effort and impatience, as Sarah and Abraham sought to fulfill God's promise of offspring through their own means rather than waiting for God's timing.<p><b>was born according to the flesh</b><br>The term "according to the flesh" indicates a natural, human way of achieving something, as opposed to divine intervention. Ishmael's birth was a result of human planning and effort, lacking the miraculous element that characterized the birth of Isaac. This phrase highlights the contrast between human initiative and divine promise, a theme that Paul uses to illustrate the difference between living under the law and living by faith.<p><b>but his son by the free woman</b><br>This refers to Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah. Sarah, unlike Hagar, was a free woman, and her status symbolizes the freedom associated with God's promise. Isaac's birth was miraculous, as Sarah was well past childbearing age, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promise through divine intervention rather than human effort. This distinction is crucial in understanding the allegory Paul presents, contrasting the old covenant of the law with the new covenant of grace.<p><b>was born through the promise</b><br>Isaac's birth was the result of God's promise to Abraham that he would have a son through Sarah, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-19</a>. This promise was fulfilled despite natural impossibilities, underscoring the power and faithfulness of God. The birth of Isaac serves as a type of Christ, as both were born through divine promise and intervention.

The apostle has evidently in his eye the analogy presented by the natural birth of the Jewish descendants from Abraham, as contrasted with the birth of Abraham's spiritual seed through faith in the promises of the gospel. This point, however, he is content with merely, in vers. 28, 29, glancing at. His main point is the condition of both mother and child in each case, as being either both free or both in bondage. It is not clear whether the apostle by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> meant "born" or "begotten," the verb being used in both senses: but neither is it material. The perfect tense of the verb either supposes us to be as it were present at the time of Ishmael's expulsion, in which case it would mean, "hath been born," or is used with reference to the record in the history, meaning in this case "appears in the story as having been born." So the perfect tense is used also in <a href="/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, and <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "According to the flesh" does not precisely mean "in the common course of torture;" the word "flesh" rather contrasts the present visible sphere of human life with the invisible spiritual world, in much the same way as "flesh" is so often contrasted with "spirit." Ishmael was born "after the flesh," <span class="accented">because</span> he was born in the common course of nature; Isaac was born (ver. 28) "after the Spirit," because his birth was connected with the invisible spiritual world "through the promise," which on the one A hand was given by God the great Sovereign of the spiritual world, and on the other was laid hold of and made effectual in that same world of spiritual action by Abraham's and Sarah's faith. But he of the freewoman <span class="cmt_word">was by promise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f76;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but the</span> son <span class="accented">by the freewoman through a promise</span> (or, <span class="accented">through the promise</span>).

This promise was the <span class="accented">means</span> of Isaac's being born, calling forth as it did an acting of faith in God, both in Abraham (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-21</a>), and likewise in Sarah (<a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>), in consideration of which the Almighty beyond the course of nature gave them this child. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His [son]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
