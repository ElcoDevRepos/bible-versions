This fear is not for his own safety or reputation but for the spiritual well-being of the Galatians. Historically, Paul had established the churches in Galatia during his missionary journeys, and he had invested significant time and effort in teaching them the gospel. His fear arises from reports that the Galatians are turning away from the true gospel to follow Judaizers, who insisted on adherence to Jewish law for salvation. This concern is similar to his warnings in other letters, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where he fears the Corinthians might be led astray from their pure devotion to Christ.<p><b>that my efforts for you</b><br>Paul's efforts included preaching, teaching, and nurturing the Galatian church. His missionary work was characterized by hardship and perseverance, as seen in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13-14</a>, where he faced opposition and persecution. The term "efforts" underscores the labor and dedication Paul invested in establishing and strengthening the Galatian believers. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual labor, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>, where believers are encouraged to be steadfast in their work for the Lord, knowing it is not in vain.<p><b>may have been in vain</b><br>The possibility that his work might be in vain highlights the seriousness of the Galatians' potential apostasy. In the biblical context, "in vain" suggests a fruitless or ineffective outcome, which is a grave concern for any minister of the gospel. This echoes the sentiment in <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>, where Paul desires to know that he did not run or labor in vain. Theologically, this phrase underscores the importance of perseverance in faith and the danger of turning away from the gospel of grace. It also reflects the biblical principle that true faith results in transformation and obedience, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians.

Paul openly expresses a loving fear that the Galatians, by turning to works-based righteousness, will nullify both the gospel&#8217;s power in their lives and the painstaking labor he has devoted to them. His words remind every believer that drifting from grace endangers not only personal spiritual health but also the faithful efforts of those God uses to nurture us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">I am afraid of you</span>, <span class="accented">lest by any means</span> 1 <span class="accented">have bestowed labour upon you in vain.</span> That is, this behaviour of yours makes me fear whether I may not have bestowed labour upon you fruitlessly. A similar construction of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with an indicative occurs in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "Fearing, whether the tempter may not have tempted you;" followed by the subjunctive, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And lest our labour should [in the as yet future result] prove to be for no good." This passage in the Thessalonians serves to illustrate the nature of the mischief, which, in the present case, the apostle feared might result. For one thing, there was the hurt, the perhaps fatal hurt, which the Galatian believers might themselves receive from that virtual renouncement of their spiritual inheritance which they now seemed to be foolishly making. But there was also the disappointment which would accrue to himself through the failure of his work among them: "For what," as he wrote to the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:19, "is our hope, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?" The same anticipated joy he speaks of in writing to the Philippians, as about to accrue to himself from the steadfastness of his converts: "That I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, neither labour in vain." This anticipation was a joy which he would fain not have wrested from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I fear</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(phoboumai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5399.htm">Strong's 5399: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phobos; to frighten, i.e. to be alarmed; by analogy, to be in awe of, i.e. Revere.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
