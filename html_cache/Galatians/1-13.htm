His "former way of life in Judaism" indicates his deep roots in Jewish tradition and law. Paul was a Pharisee, a sect known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). This background provided him with a thorough understanding of Jewish customs and beliefs, which he later used to argue for the truth of the Gospel. His transformation from a devout Jew to a follower of Christ highlights the power of the Gospel to change lives.<p><b>how severely I persecuted the church of God</b><br>Paul's persecution of the church is documented in <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a> and <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>, where he is described as ravaging the church and imprisoning believers. This persecution was driven by his zeal for Jewish law and his belief that the followers of Jesus were blasphemers. His actions were in line with the Jewish leadership's stance against the early Christian movement, which they saw as a threat to their religious authority and traditions.<p><b>and tried to destroy it</b><br>Paul's intent to destroy the church underscores the intensity of his opposition. The Greek word used here for "destroy" implies a complete and utter annihilation. This reflects the early church's precarious position and the significant challenges it faced from both Jewish and Roman authorities. Paul's later conversion and role as a leading apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>) serve as a powerful testimony to the transformative power of Christ, illustrating that even the most ardent opponent can become a devoted follower.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, who was once a zealous persecutor of Christians before his conversion to Christianity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaism.htm">Judaism</a></b><br>The religious context in which Paul was deeply rooted before his conversion.

The Galatians already knew the facts: Paul, once the most zealous opponent of the church, had received mercy and a commission. By recalling his violent history, Paul proves that the gospel he now proclaims cannot be a human invention; only divine intervention explains such a transformation. The verse therefore challenges readers to trust the unchangeable gospel and celebrate the power of God to redeem even the fiercest enemy into a devoted servant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13, 14) Proof that the doctrine of the Apostle is derived from God and not from man, in that it could not be accounted for by his antecedents and education, all of which told <span class= "ital">against,</span> rather than <span class= "ital">for,</span> a Christian belief of any kind.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Ye have heard.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">ye heard.</span> It was indeed notorious; but the Apostle may be referring to the fact that he himself usually (see <a href="/context/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3-21</a>; <a href="/context/acts/26-4.htm" title="My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;">Acts 26:4-20</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1Corinthians 15:8-10</a>) brought his own career and experiences into his preaching, so that they may have heard it from his own lips.<p><span class= "bld">My conversation . . . in the Jews' religion.</span>--How I behaved in the days of my Judaism.

This "for" introduces the whole statement which follows down to the end of the chapter; for the entire section is written with the view of substantiating the assertion in ver. 12, that he had not received the gospel which he preached from man, but solely through illumination imparted immediately from heaven. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have been told; as <a href="/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a>; <a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>, and often. "I am only stating what ye have already been apprised of, when I tell you of," etc. That the aorist tense of the Greek word does not limit the expression to any one communication, such <span class="accented">e.g. as</span> one made by the apostle himself, is shown by the use of this very aorist in blurt, 5:21, 33, etc.; <a href="/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a>; <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>. The apostle appears to have been himself in the habit of frequently telling the wondrous story of what he once had been and of the change wrought upon him. We have instances of his doing this in fill detail in his speech from the stairs, and in his defence before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1-16</a>; <a href="/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>.), and with less fulness in <a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8, 9</a>. It is therefore quite supposable that he had himself said as much also in Galatia. We observe, however, that the apostle does not say, "heard from me," as he might have done if he had himself been their informant: and, further, that the effect of the words, "ye have heard," does not, in point of construction at least, of necessity extend beyond the fourteenth verse. We are therefore at liberty to surmise that what he here refers to as having been told them relates simply to his life before his conversion; and that the accounts which they had received of it bad come through unfriendly informants. These may have been either unbelieving Jews or Judaizing Christians, who wished by these statements to disparage the apostle's character as one who, if he really was not dishonest, was at all events capable of passing from one extreme of sentiments to their direct opposite with the utmost suddenness and levity, and therefore was not a man entitled to be regarded with confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">of my manner of life formerly in Judaism.</span> "The manner in which I once behaved myself as devoted to Judaism."

"Judaism" means "the religious life of a Jew," which distinctively was Mosaism. It occurs in 2 Macc. 2:21 2Macc. 14:38; 4 Macc. 4:16. Ignatius ('Ad Magn.,' 8) speaks of "not living according to Judaism," as in ibid., 10, he uses the word "Christianism." St. Paul has the verb "Judaize" below, <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>.

The verb properly denotes "devastate," "harry;" and in classical Greek is used with reference to towns, countries, and the like, being applied to persons only in the poetical style (Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament it is used only in relation to Soul's persecution, apparently marking its deadly effectiveness as well as Saul's determination if possible to <span class="accented">extirpate</span> the faith and its adherents. The <span class="accented">expugnabam</span> of the Vulgate would seem a fair equivalent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
