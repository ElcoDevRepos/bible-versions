In the context of Galatians, Paul addresses the Judaizers who insisted that Gentile Christians must adhere to Jewish law. Historically, the Law was given to Israel at Mount Sinai, serving as a covenant between God and His people. However, the Law was never intended as a means of salvation but as a guide to reveal sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The curse refers to the consequences of failing to uphold the entire Law, as no one can perfectly keep it (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). This underscores the need for faith in Christ, who redeems from the curse of the Law (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><b>For it is written:</b><br>Paul often uses this phrase to introduce Old Testament quotations, affirming the authority and continuity of Scripture. By doing so, he connects his teachings to the Jewish Scriptures, which his audience would have respected. This method also demonstrates that the New Testament message is a fulfillment of the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.&#8221;</b><br>This quote is from <a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, part of the blessings and curses pronounced upon Israel. The historical context is the renewal of the covenant as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. The phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the Law; partial obedience is insufficient. Theologically, it points to the impossibility of achieving righteousness through human effort. This curse highlights humanity's need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Law and bore its curse on behalf of believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia about the dangers of relying on the law for justification.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of the letter resided.

The antithesis is: faith--blessing; law--curse. The "curse" was the penalty which the Law itself imposed upon all who failed to keep it. None really kept it, and therefore none escaped this curse.<p><span class= "bld">As many as are of the works of the law.</span>--An expression corresponding to "they which are of faith" in <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-9.htm" title="So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.">Galatians 3:9</a>. The meaning is, "Those who take their character from works done in obedience to law--the cast of whose lives is determined by the principle of legal obedience.<p><span class= "bld">Under the curse.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">are under a curse;</span> subject to a curse.<p><span class= "bld">For it is written.</span>--The Apostle proceeds to quote the clause in the Law by which this curse was entailed. The quotation is from <a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm" title="Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, where it forms the conclusion of the series of curses to be pronounced from Mount Ebal. The Hebrew text is, "Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them." The word "all" is inserted in the Authorised version, probably from this passage. The Hebrew has also simply "he that" for "every one who;" so that the absolute and sweeping nature of the condemnation would seem to be much less marked in the original. It is not, however, clear that this character was first given to it by St. Paul. "Every one" is found in the Peshito Syriac, which <span class= "ital">may</span> have been influenced by the language of St. Paul; "in <span class= "ital">all</span> things" is found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, which certainly was not so influenced. The quotation is made by Justin (<span class= "ital">Trypho,</span> ? 95) in precisely the same words as by St. Paul. Justin, however, is not improbably quoting through the medium of this Epistle. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- For as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">under a curse</span>, or, <span class="accented">under cursing.</span> "For." The apostle is now making the clause in the preceding verse, "they who are of faith," the <span class="accented">limiting</span> description of those who "are blessed with faithful Abraham;" - I say, they who are of faith; for they who are of the works of the Law are in a very different case. In the phrase, "are of the works of the Law," the preposition "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) has the same force as has been already noted in the phrase (ver. 9), "they who are of faith;" it signifies dependence upon, belonging to, taking position from; and it marks a moral posture of mind voluntarily assumed. The apostle in laying down the aphorism of the present passage has doubtless an eye to those of the Galatians who were moving for the adoption of circumcision and the ceremonies of the Levitical Law. Withdrawing from the category of those who were of faith, they were preparing to join those who were of the works of the Law. If their taking up with circumcision, and with these or those of the Levitical ordinances, was not mere childish trifling; if in serious and solemn earnest it meant anything, it meant this - that they looked to gain from these observances acceptableness before God, as performing works commanded by his Law given through Moses; but in that view they were bound to take the Law in its entirety, and do <span class="accented">every</span> work which it prescribed, ceremonial and moral alike; for all of it came invested with the like authority and as a part of that institution was alike binding (see <a href="/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>). Let them now consider well how in such circumstances their case would stand. That the "works of the Law" which stand foremost before the apostle's view in the present discussion are those of a ceremonial character is apparent from the tenor both of vers. 12-19 of the preceding chapter and of vers. 1-10 of the next. There is, indeed, generally tiffs difference observable between the phase of the Law regarded in this Epistle, as compared with that which engages the apostle's thoughts when writing to the Romans: in the Romans the prominent notion of the spiritual condition of those under the Law is that they are in a state of guiltiness, condemnation, spiritual inability, unconquered sin; while in the Galatians the prominent notion of their condition is that they are in a state of slavery, <span class="accented">that</span> the dispensation they are under is spiritually an enslaving one, a yoke of bondage (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1-3, 9, 24, 31</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). In the Romans the moral aspect of the Law is mostly in view; in this Epistle its ceremonial aspect. The consideration of these distinctive features marking this Epistle will perhaps prepare us the more readily to apprehend the particular shade of meaning with which the apostle uses the words, "are under cursing." He means, not precisely that a curse has already been definitely pronounced upon them so that they now stand there condemned, but that the <span class="accented">threatening</span> of a curse is always sounding in their ears, filling them with uneasiness, with constant apprehension that they shall themselves fall under it. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is thus used for malediction, cursing, in <a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9, 10</a>, "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men;... out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>);" <a href="/deuteronomy/27-13.htm">Deuteronomy 27:13</a> (Septuagint), "These shall stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) for the cursing upon Mount Ebal" - that is, for the denouncement of the several curses with which they were to threaten different classes of transgressors. As many, says the apostle, as are of the works of the Law are under a black cloud of malediction, which is ready to flash forth in lightning wrath upon every failure in obedience. And what man of them all can hope not to merit that inexorable lighting down of judgment? Supposing them to be ever so exact and punctual in their observance of those ordinances of the flesh which certain of those Galatian Churchmen are hankering after, how will it fare with them in respect to those other weightier precepts of the Law which require spiritual obedience? For one single example, how will they be able to render unfailing obedience to the commandment, Thou shalt not covet? Beyond question, the apostle writes with the sense which he has so fully developed in his Epistle to the Romans (<a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-20</a>; <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), that no one under the economy of the Law ever did, or ever could, continue in all things which were written in the Law to do them; and that therefore they that forsook the gospel of Christ to look to the Law for acceptance with God would beyond doubt become, nay, taken as they were at any moment had already become, each individual, the specific object of malediction, a child of cursing, a child of wrath (<a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>). Nevertheless, his purpose just here may be presumed to be, not to affirm this, but rather to point to the miserable state of apprehensiveness and fear of instant wrath which they who were of the works of the Law must needs be in bondage to. Most commentators, however, understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning, not "cursing" or uttering general sentences of cursing (<span class="accented">maledictio</span>), but "a curse" (<span class="accented">maledictum</span>), that is, a specific curse incurred already by each individual in consequence of his having of a certainty already sinned against some commandment of the Law; if not against some ceremonial commandment, at any rate against some moral precept. Whichever way we understand it, such (the apostle at all events means) was the condition into which those Judaizing Gentile converts were preparing to precipitate themselves. For it is written, <span class="cmt_word">Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the book of the Law to do them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> without <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which conjunction is according to the Greek usage introduced superfluously] <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>). The Septuagint (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>) has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> [this <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> of doubtful genuineness] <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> [or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew is correctly given in the Authorized Version, "Cursed <span class="accented">be</span> he that confirmeth not <span class="accented">all</span> the words of this Law to do them." The apostle, quoting the Septuagint apparently from memory, gives the general sense rather than the exact words. He that sins against a commandment, as (to use the Septuagint phrase) he does not "continue in" it, but departs from it, so also, he, as far as his action reaches, sets it aside or abrogates it instead of "confirming" it. The word "all," not found in our present Hebrew text, is stated by critics to be in the Samaritan as well as in the Septuagint. This is the last of the twelve several maledictions pronounced from Mount Ebal, and certainly includes in its scope the ceremonial as well as the moral precepts of the Law. But what did this malediction import? Certainly it expressed abhorrence - the Divine Author of the Law, and his ministers and people accepting, pronouncing, and ratifying the denunciation, all join in repudiating the offender, casting him out from among them with loathing: so much is clear. What practical effect was to be given to the malediction, even by men in this life, not to speak of the action of God hereafter in the life to come, is nowhere indicated; but all could see thus much - the offender, if dying unreconciled, would depart hence accursed of both man and God. The notion of guiltiness before God and accursedness incurred by transgression of merely ceremonial precepts has been so greatly effaced from men's consciousness by the teaching, direct and indirect, of Christ's gospel, that we find it hard to realize to our minds that there ever existed a posture of the spirit answering to such a notion, or. if such did exist, that it could be other than the fruit of an uninstructed, ill-trained state of the conscience. But it was not this, so long as the economy of Moses was in force. For these positive laws were laws of God, binding during his pleasure upon the conscience of every Israelite; and in proportion as an Israelite's consciousness of the existence of Jehovah and of his own covenant relation to Jehovah was real and vivid, in that proportion would he be careful, scrupulously careful even, in obeying those positive laws. He had, indeed, to duly estimate the comparative importance and obligation of positive and of moral precepts, especially when in actual practice they came into conflict, according to the principle laid down for example in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; but it was at his peril that he at any time neglected the former, though still less might he dare to neglect the latter. For every Israelite, as long as the Law continued in force, that which was said by Christ was strictly true, and in both clauses meant to be taken in solemn earnest, "These latter ought he to do, and not to leave the other undone" (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). It was, for instance, a matter of conscience for the truly conscientious Israelite to carefully purify himself from pollution incurred by contact with the dead, and to abstain from swine's flesh; he might not neglect such purifications or partake of such meat without breaking a commandment of God's, without therefore incurring God's displeasure; and it behoved him to feel that he could not, and in proportion to the sincerity and depth of his religious sentiment he did feel it. Now, even when Israelites lived in a world of their own, comparatively free from the presence of Gentiles, the observance of the Levitical Law must needs have been at times felt to be an irksome or even anxious obligation; but its irksomeness and anxiety must have been greatly increased when Gentiles were not merely brought into close contact with them, but were even their masters. St. Peter confessed how burdensome it was felt to be, when he pronounced it a yoke which neither they nor their fathers had been able to bear. The feeling of relief must therefore have been inexpressibly great when an Israelite could come to be assured that those positive laws had ceased to be obligatory; that even if from habit or from national or social sentiment he continued to observe them, yet his conscience was quite free to disregard them without fear of displeasing God; that God's covenanted mercy had no longer any reference whatever to such observances, and that he might worship him acceptably, and hold joyful communion with him (say) in the Lord's Supper, though he had just before been handling a corpse without being since purified, or eating "unclean" meats, or working on the sabbath day. This relief the gospel brought; God's servants learnt with joy that they were righteous and accepted before him simply through faith in Christ without those "works of the Law." The curse was reversed. <span class="accented">Now</span> it ran thus: "Anathema be he who doth not wholly trust in Christ crucified for righteousness! Anathema be he who brings dead ordinances of the Law to darken his brethren's joy!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hosoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
