Peter, also known as Cephas, was one of the original twelve apostles and played a crucial role in the early church, particularly among Jewish believers. His apostleship is highlighted in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where he delivers a powerful sermon at Pentecost, leading to the conversion of many Jews. The phrase underscores the divine authority and empowerment behind Peter's ministry, emphasizing that it was not by his own strength but through God's work.<p><b>to the circumcised</b><br>The term "circumcised" refers to the Jewish people, who practiced circumcision as a sign of the covenant with God, as established with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>. In the early church, there was a significant focus on reaching the Jewish population with the message of Jesus as the Messiah. Peter's primary mission field was among the Jews, as seen in his ministry in Jerusalem and his interactions with Jewish leaders. This focus aligns with the cultural and religious context of the time, where the early Christian message was first proclaimed to the Jews before spreading to the Gentiles.<p><b>was also at work in my apostleship</b><br>Here, Paul is speaking of his own calling and mission, which was divinely appointed. Paul's apostleship is well-documented in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Acts and his epistles. His conversion and calling are described in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>, where Jesus appears to him on the road to Damascus. This divine encounter marks the beginning of Paul's mission to spread the gospel. The phrase emphasizes the parallel between Peter's and Paul's ministries, both being empowered by the same God.<p><b>to the Gentiles</b><br>The Gentiles refer to all non-Jewish people. Paul's mission to the Gentiles was revolutionary, as it expanded the reach of the gospel beyond the Jewish community. This mission is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God declares that His salvation will reach the ends of the earth. Paul's work among the Gentiles is chronicled in his missionary journeys, as recorded in Acts, and in his letters to various Gentile churches, such as those in Rome, Corinth, and Ephesus. This outreach reflects the inclusive nature of the gospel and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as articulated in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Cephas)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' original twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his ministry primarily to the Jewish people (the circumcised).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (Apostle to the Gentiles)</a></b><br>Formerly known as Saul, Paul was a Pharisee who converted to Christianity and became a leading figure in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles (non-Jews).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_circumcised.htm">The Circumcised (Jews)</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, who were traditionally circumcised as a sign of their covenant with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gentiles.htm">The Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were often seen as outside the covenant community of Israel but were included in the Gospel message through Paul's ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one.htm">The One (God)</a></b><br>Refers to God, who empowered both Peter and Paul in their respective ministries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>God works through different people in different ways, yet all are part of His unified plan.

God wrought on Peter's behalf for apostleship of the circumcision; that is, towards, in furtherance of, his work as their apostle, by constituting him their apostle, by making his ministry effectual in turning their hearts to Christ, and by miracles wrought by his hands, including the impartation through him of miraculous gifts to his converts; for such were "the signs of the apostle" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">had wrought also on my behalf towards the Gentiles.</span> Comp. <a href="/acts/15-12.htm">Acts 15:12</a>, "They hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) among the Gentiles by them;" where likewise, as here, the aorist tense is used of action they were then looking back upon as past. The absence of Barnabas's name in this verse, though mentioned in the next, is significant.
