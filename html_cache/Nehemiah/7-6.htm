After the Babylonian exile, the Persian Empire allowed the Jews to return to their homeland, which was now a province under Persian control. This return was significant as it marked the beginning of the restoration of the Jewish community and religious practices in their ancestral land.<p><b>who came up from the captivity of the exiles</b><br>The captivity refers to the period of Babylonian exile, which began in 586 BC when Jerusalem was destroyed, and many Jews were taken to Babylon. This exile was a pivotal event in Jewish history, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>. The return from exile was seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>.<p><b>carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar its king</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was the Babylonian king responsible for the conquest of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people. His reign is well-documented both biblically and historically, with archaeological evidence supporting the events described in the Bible. The exile was a result of the Israelites' disobedience to God, as warned by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>They returned to Jerusalem and Judah</b><br>The return to Jerusalem and Judah was a significant event, marking the fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people back to their land. This return was led by figures such as Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and it involved the rebuilding of the temple and the walls of Jerusalem. The returnees faced numerous challenges, including opposition from surrounding peoples, but their efforts were crucial in re-establishing Jewish identity and worship.<p><b>each to his own town</b><br>This phrase indicates that the returning exiles sought to reclaim their ancestral lands and re-establish their communities.

Like <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>, the wording underscores continuity: the same covenant community that once lived under Davidic kings now exists under foreign governors, yet still bears God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/jeremiah/31-36.htm">Jeremiah 31:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who came up from the captivity of the exiles</b><p>The journey &#8220;up&#8221; from Babylon to Judah reflects both geography and spiritual ascent. <a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1</a> pictures that moment as a dream fulfilled&#8212;captives restored.
