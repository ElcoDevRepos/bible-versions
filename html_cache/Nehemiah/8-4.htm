The high wooden platform signifies the importance of the event, allowing Ezra to be seen and heard by the large assembly. This public reading of the Law was a pivotal moment in re-establishing the covenant community. The use of a platform highlights the reverence for God's Word and the need for clear communication.

This arrangement may also symbolize the comprehensive nature of the community's commitment to the Law, involving various tribes and families.
