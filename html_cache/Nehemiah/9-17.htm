Throughout their history, the Israelites often ignored the prophets and leaders sent by God to guide them. This refusal to listen is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24-26</a>, where the people are described as having stubborn hearts and not listening to God's voice.<p><b>and failed to remember the wonders You performed among them.</b><br>The Israelites' forgetfulness of God's miraculous deeds, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna, underscores their lack of faith and gratitude. This forgetfulness is a common human failing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11-16</a>, where the psalmist recounts the wonders God performed and the people's subsequent forgetfulness.<p><b>They stiffened their necks</b><br>This metaphor of a stiff neck is used throughout the Bible to describe obstinacy and resistance to God's will. It evokes the image of an animal that refuses to be guided or directed. In <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, God describes the Israelites as a "stiff-necked people" after they worship the golden calf, illustrating their stubbornness and rebellion.<p><b>and appointed a leader to return them to their bondage in Egypt.</b><br>This refers to the Israelites' desire to return to Egypt during their wilderness journey, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>. Despite the harsh conditions of slavery, they longed for the familiarity of Egypt when faced with challenges. This reflects a lack of trust in God's promise to lead them to the Promised Land and a preference for the known over the unknown.<p><b>But You are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's character, which is central to the biblical narrative. God's forgiveness and grace are evident throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God reveals Himself to Moses as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." This divine nature is a source of hope and redemption for humanity.<p><b>slow to anger and rich in loving devotion,</b><br>God's patience and steadfast love are recurring themes in Scripture. His slowness to anger demonstrates His desire for repentance rather than punishment. This is echoed in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where it is stated that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance. His loving devotion, or "hesed," is a covenantal love that remains faithful despite human unfaithfulness.<p><b>and You did not forsake them.</b><br>Despite the Israelites' repeated failures, God remained faithful to His covenant with them. This faithfulness is a testament to His unchanging nature and commitment to His people. In <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, God promises never to leave nor forsake His people, a promise that is fulfilled throughout the biblical narrative and ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who were delivered from Egypt but often rebelled against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, characterized by forgiveness, grace, compassion, patience, and loving devotion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The leader who is recounting Israel's history and God's faithfulness in this prayer of confession.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders</a></b><br>The miraculous acts performed by God, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_character.htm">God's Unchanging Character</a></b><br>Despite human rebellion, God's nature remains constant.

Several MSS. have <span class="accented">b'Mitzraim</span> for <span class="accented">b'Miryam</span>, which would give the sense "appointed a captain to return to their bondage in Egypt." So the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Appointed a captain</span>. The reference is to <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>, where we are told that the Israelites "said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt." The Levites speak as if the appointment had been made, perhaps regarding the intention as morally equivalent to the act. <span class="cmt_word">A God ready to pardon</span>. Literally, "a God of pardons." The word used is a rare one, occurring only in <a href="/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, besides the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness</span>.
