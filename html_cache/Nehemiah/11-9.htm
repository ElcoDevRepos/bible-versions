The name Joel means "Yahweh is God," which reflects the theocentric culture of the Israelites. Zichri, his father, is a name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, suggesting a lineage that may have been respected or well-known. The role of an officer in this context likely involved administrative or military responsibilities, crucial for maintaining order and governance in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period. This reflects the organizational efforts of Nehemiah to restore and secure the city after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the Second District of the city</b><br>Judah, another leader, is described as the son of Hassenuah. The name Judah, meaning "praise," is significant as it is also the name of the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. Hassenuah is less frequently mentioned, but the inclusion of his name suggests a recognized family or clan. The "Second District of the city" indicates a division within Jerusalem, highlighting the administrative structure Nehemiah implemented. This division was necessary for effective governance and reflects the rebuilding efforts to restore Jerusalem's former glory. The mention of districts also suggests a growing population and the need for organized leadership, aligning with Nehemiah's broader mission to reestablish the Jewish community in their ancestral land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel_son_of_zichri.htm">Joel son of Zichri</a></b><br>Joel is identified as an officer, indicating a position of leadership and responsibility among the people.
