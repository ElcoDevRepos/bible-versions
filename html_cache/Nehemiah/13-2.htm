In <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>, it is recorded that these nations did not provide assistance to the Israelites, which was a customary act of hospitality in the ancient Near East. This lack of hospitality was significant because it demonstrated hostility and a refusal to support God's chosen people. The cultural expectation of providing for travelers was deeply ingrained, and failing to do so was seen as an act of enmity.<p><b>but had hired Balaam to call down a curse against them</b><br>The Moabites and Ammonites went further by hiring Balaam, a prophet, to curse the Israelites, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>. This act of hiring Balaam shows the extent of their opposition to Israel. Balaam's story is a complex one, as he was a prophet who had knowledge of the true God but was swayed by the promise of wealth. This incident highlights the spiritual warfare against Israel and the attempts to thwart God's plans through supernatural means. Balaam's involvement is also a reminder of the spiritual battle that believers face, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>(although our God had turned the curse into a blessing)</b><br>Despite the intentions of the Moabites and Balaam, God intervened and transformed the intended curse into a blessing. This demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to protect and bless His people despite opposition. In <a href="/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>, Balaam ends up blessing Israel instead of cursing them, which underscores the theme of God's providence and faithfulness. This transformation is a type of Christ, who turns curses into blessings for believers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13-14</a>, where Christ redeems us from the curse of the law.
