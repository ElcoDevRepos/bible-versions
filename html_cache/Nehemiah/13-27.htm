Nehemiah, as a leader, is addressing the community with a rhetorical question that underscores the gravity of the situation. The use of "now" suggests that this is a recurring issue, reflecting the ongoing struggle of the Israelites to maintain their covenantal purity. This echoes the earlier reforms Nehemiah had implemented and the promises made by the people in <a href="/nehemiah/10-30.htm">Nehemiah 10:30</a>.<p><b>that you too are doing</b><br>The phrase "you too" implies that the people being addressed are part of a larger group that has previously committed similar transgressions. This highlights the communal nature of sin and the influence of peer behavior. It suggests a pattern of disobedience that Nehemiah is trying to correct, reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated failures to uphold God's laws throughout their history, as seen in Judges and Kings.<p><b>all this terrible evil</b><br>The term "terrible evil" is a strong condemnation of the actions being taken. In the context of the Old Testament, marrying foreign women was seen as a direct violation of God's commands, as it often led to idolatry and the dilution of religious practices. This phrase reflects the severity with which such actions were viewed, aligning with the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a> about the dangers of intermarriage with pagan nations.<p><b>and acting unfaithfully against our God</b><br>"Acting unfaithfully" suggests a breach of trust and covenant with God. The Israelites were chosen to be a holy nation, set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). By marrying foreign women, they were not only disobeying a specific command but also compromising their unique identity and relationship with God. This unfaithfulness is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel's idolatry is often likened to marital infidelity (Hosea 1-3).<p><b>by marrying foreign women?</b><br>Marrying foreign women was explicitly prohibited in the Mosaic Law due to the risk of leading the Israelites away from worshiping Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This prohibition was not based on ethnicity but on religious purity and the potential for syncretism. The historical context includes Solomon's downfall due to his foreign wives leading him into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>). This serves as a warning and a type of Christ, who is the faithful bridegroom to the Church, His bride, emphasizing the call for spiritual purity and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community.

After leading the people in covenant renewal (<a href="/bsb/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>), he returns from Persia only to &#8220;hear&#8221; fresh reports of compromise. Scripture often treats sinful rumors as an alarm bell: &#8220;It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>). The mere fact that the news has reached him signals public scandal, like Eli confronting his sons: &#8220;Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-23.htm">1 Samuel 2:23</a>). Hearing persistent sin after clear teaching shows hearts resisting God&#8217;s word rather than ignorance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you too</b><p>Nehemiah singles out leaders and ordinary people alike&#8212;&#8220;you too&#8221;&#8212;not outsiders. Just as Paul rebukes Jews who &#8220;teach others&#8221; yet fail to obey themselves (<a href="/romans/2-21.htm">Romans 2:21</a>), spiritual insiders are held to the highest standard (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>). Ezra had faced this very failure only years earlier (<a href="/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10&#8211;12</a>). The repetition of sin among the same covenant community intensifies the offense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are doing all this terrible evil</b><p>The phrase stacks words to underline gravity. Scripture never labels disobedience lightly; idolatry and covenant-breaking are called &#8220;evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2</a>). &#8226; Evil is never isolated&#8212;small compromises snowball (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11&#8211;13</a>). &#8226; What the world might view as cultural blending, God calls &#8220;terrible&#8221; when it opposes His revealed will (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and acting unfaithfully against our God</b><p>&#8220;Unfaithfully&#8221; recalls marriage imagery between God and His people. When Judah mixed worship, the prophets cried, &#8220;They have been unfaithful to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>). Malachi, Nehemiah&#8217;s contemporary, echoes: &#8220;Judah has acted treacherously&#8230; marrying the daughter of a foreign god&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>). Faithfulness is personal; sin wounds a relationship, not just a rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by marrying foreign women?</b><p>The issue is spiritual, not racial. God forbade intermarriage with nations that would &#8220;turn your sons away from following Me&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a>). Earlier the people vowed, &#8220;We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the land&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/10-30.htm">Nehemiah 10:30</a>), yet they broke that pledge. &#8226; Solomon&#8217;s downfall (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;4</a>) illustrates the danger. &#8226; Ezra tore his garments for the same sin (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1&#8211;3</a>). &#8226; The principle continues: &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Marrying outside the faith invites divided devotion, threatens family worship, and models disobedience to children.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nehemiah&#8217;s question packs a fivefold punch: How can God&#8217;s own people, who heard the truth, repeat known sin, multiply evil, break covenant, and marry in ways that lure hearts from Him? The verse reminds believers today that public testimony matters, leaders are not exempt, sin is never minor, unfaithfulness grieves a personal God, and marriage must champion shared faith to guard generational loyalty to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall we then hearken unto you?</span> Shall we give way to you, and adopt the practice which you recommend, thus transgressing against God, and provoking him to destroy us?
