As the governor of Jerusalem, Nehemiah was responsible for the city's security and administration. His role was crucial in the restoration of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, reflecting the importance of strong leadership in times of rebuilding and renewal.<p><b>Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot</b><br>This instruction was a security measure. In ancient times, city gates were typically opened at dawn. By delaying the opening until the sun was hot, Nehemiah ensured that the city was more secure from potential early morning attacks. This reflects the vigilance required to protect the community, a theme echoed in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which warns believers to be sober and vigilant.<p><b>While the guards are on duty</b><br>The presence of guards highlights the need for constant vigilance and protection. In the context of Jerusalem's reconstruction, it was essential to have a watchful eye against enemies. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance, as believers are called to guard their hearts and minds (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><b>Keep the doors shut and securely fastened</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of security and preparedness. The securely fastened doors symbolize the need to protect what is valuable, akin to the spiritual armor described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>. It also reflects the idea of safeguarding one's faith and community from external threats.<p><b>And appoint the residents of Jerusalem as guards</b><br>Involving the residents in the city's defense underscores the communal responsibility for security. This participatory approach fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among the people. It parallels the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member has a role to play (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>Some at their posts and some at their own homes</b><br>This strategy ensured comprehensive coverage of the city, with guards stationed at strategic points and others protecting their own homes. It highlights the balance between communal and personal responsibility. Spiritually, it suggests the importance of being vigilant both in the community of faith and in one's personal life, as seen in the call to be watchful in prayer (<a href="/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Jerusalem who led the rebuilding of the city's walls and instituted reforms to restore the community's spiritual and social order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city of the Jewish people, which had been in ruins and was being rebuilt under Nehemiah's leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards.htm">Guards</a></b><br>Individuals appointed by Nehemiah to protect the city by controlling access through the gates and ensuring the safety of its inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates_of_jerusalem.htm">Gates of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The entry points to the city, which were crucial for security and commerce, and needed to be carefully managed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/residents_of_jerusalem.htm">Residents of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The people living in the city who were given responsibilities to guard and protect their community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_spiritual_life.htm">Vigilance in Spiritual Life</a></b><br>Just as Nehemiah instructed the guards to be vigilant, Christians are called to be watchful in their spiritual lives, guarding against sin and temptation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Nehemiah's appointment of residents as guards highlights the importance of each member's role in the community.
