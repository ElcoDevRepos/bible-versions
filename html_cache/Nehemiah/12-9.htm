The Levites were a tribe set apart for religious duties, and their role was crucial in the worship and spiritual life of Israel. Bakbukiah is noted elsewhere in Nehemiah as a leader among the Levites, indicating his significant role in the community. Unni, though less frequently mentioned, shares in this important service. Their inclusion highlights the importance of leadership and service in worship.<p><b>their associates</b><br>The term "associates" refers to other Levites who were involved in the temple services. This collective effort underscores the communal nature of worship and the importance of teamwork in fulfilling religious duties. It reflects the organized structure of Levitical service, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in 1 Chronicles, where the divisions of the Levites are detailed.<p><b>stood across from them</b><br>This phrase suggests a specific arrangement or positioning during the service, possibly indicating a form of antiphonal singing or responsive worship, a practice where groups sing or chant in response to each other. This method of worship is seen in other parts of scripture, such as in the Psalms, and emphasizes the participatory and dynamic nature of worship in ancient Israel.<p><b>in the services</b><br>The services refer to the religious duties and ceremonies conducted by the Levites, which included singing, playing instruments, and other acts of worship. These services were integral to the spiritual life of the community and were conducted according to the instructions given in the Law of Moses. The dedication of the wall was a significant event, symbolizing the restoration and renewal of the community, and the Levites' role in these services was essential in leading the people in worship and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bakbukiah.htm">Bakbukiah</a></b><br>A Levite who played a significant role in the musical and worship services during the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem.

Bakbukiah's position with respect to Mattaniah has been already mentioned (<a href="/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>).

LIST OF THE HIGH PRIESTS FROM JESHUA TO JADDUA (<a href="/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>). That this is the line of descent in the high priestly family of the time sufficiently appears both from the names themselves, and from the position assigned to those who bore them in vers. 22, 23, 26. Whether all of them actually exercised the high priest's office is left uncertain in Scripture, but satisfactorily established by Josephus. The six names cover a space of at least 205 years - from the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, to the submission of Jerusalem to Alexander the Great, <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, which gives very long generations, but still such as are historically possible. Jeshua was certainly high priest from <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 516</span>. He may have been succeeded by his son, Joiakim, about <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>. Joiakim had certainly been succeeded by his son, Eliashib, before <span class="date">B.C. 444</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>); and Eliashib was probably succeeded by Joiada about <span class="date">B.C. 420</span>. Joiada's high priesthood may be assigned to the period between <span class="date">B.C. 420</span> and 380; Jonathan's to that between <span class="date">B.C. 380</span> and 350. Jaddua might then hold the dignity from <span class="date">B.C. 350</span> to 330, or later, and so be brought into contact with Alexander the Great. It is questioned whether in that case Nehemiah can have written the present passage, and certain that he cannot have done so unless he lived to be at least 131 years of age. As this is exceedingly improbable, it is best to suppose, either that the whole list was placed here by Malachi, or at any rate that that prophet added the clause, "and Jonathan begat Jaddua." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Bakbukiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1467;&#1469;&#1511;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;buq&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1229.htm">Strong's 1229: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bakbukiah -- 'emptying of Yah', a Levite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Unni,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;un&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6042.htm">Strong's 6042: </a> </span><span class="str2">Unni -- two Levites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their associates,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[stood] across from them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ne&#7713;&#183;d&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5048.htm">Strong's 5048: </a> </span><span class="str2">A front, part opposite, a counterpart, mate, over against, before</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the services.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;m&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4931.htm">Strong's 4931: </a> </span><span class="str2">A guard, watch, charge, function</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/nehemiah/12-9.htm">Nehemiah 12:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/nehemiah/12-9.htm">OT History: Nehemiah 12:9 Also Bakbukiah and Unno their brothers were (Neh Ne) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/nehemiah/12-8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Nehemiah 12:8"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 12:8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/nehemiah/12-10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Nehemiah 12:10"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 12:10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
