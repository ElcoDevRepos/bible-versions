The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). Tobiah's presence indicates the political and social opposition Nehemiah faced. His position "beside him" suggests he was aligned with Sanballat, another opponent, highlighting the coalition against the Jewish restoration efforts.<p><b>&#8220;If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building,</b><br>The fox is used metaphorically to imply weakness and fragility. In the ancient Near East, foxes were considered small and relatively harmless creatures. Tobiah's mockery suggests that the wall's construction was so feeble that even a light creature like a fox could cause it to collapse. This ridicule was intended to demoralize the builders and undermine their confidence.<p><b>it would break down their wall of stones!&#8221;</b><br>The wall of stones refers to the physical structure Nehemiah and the Israelites were rebuilding. Historically, Jerusalem's walls were significant for protection and identity. Tobiah's scornful comment dismisses the quality and durability of the work, aiming to belittle the efforts and resources of the Jewish people. This reflects a broader theme of opposition faced by God's people throughout scripture, as seen in the persistent challenges during the rebuilding of the temple in Ezra. The wall's eventual completion, despite such taunts, symbolizes perseverance and divine support, prefiguring the spiritual fortification found in Christ, who is described as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tobiah_the_ammonite.htm">Tobiah the Ammonite</a></b><br>Tobiah is an Ammonite official who, along with Sanballat, opposes the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

Earlier we met him when &#8220;it displeased [him] greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>). The label &#8220;Ammonite&#8221; reminds us:<p>&#8226; Ammon had long stood opposed to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Enemies often resurface when God&#8217;s people advance (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>Tobiah embodies the recurring resistance that seeks to discourage every fresh move of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was beside him</b><p>Tobiah isn&#8217;t isolated; he is &#8220;beside&#8221; Sanballat, linking arms in opposition. Scripture warns about the company we keep: &#8220;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked&#8230; or sit in the seat of mockers&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). Their alliance illustrates:<p>&#8226; Evil naturally networks (<a href="/psalms/83-3.htm">Psalm 83:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Partnerships amplify hostility (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p>Standing shoulder-to-shoulder against God&#8217;s work always backfires (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said</b><p>Words matter. &#8220;The tongue has the power of life and death&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).

In reality Nehemiah&#8217;s wall would stand completed in fifty-two days (<a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a>). God turns insults into testimony:<p>&#8226; &#8220;See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone&#8230; the one who believes will be unshaken&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p>Opposition forecasts failure, but God guarantees endurance: &#8220;No weapon formed against you shall prosper&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Tobiah&#8217;s sarcastic jab spotlights a timeless clash: mockers belittle what God&#8217;s people build, yet the Lord Himself secures every stone.
