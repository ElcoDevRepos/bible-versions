This highlights the importance of spiritual discernment, a theme echoed in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits. Nehemiah's realization underscores the need for leaders to be vigilant against false prophets, a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>but that he had uttered this prophecy against me</b><br>The false prophecy was intended to intimidate and discredit Nehemiah. Prophets in Israel were expected to speak God's truth, but false prophets often arose, as seen in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>). This incident reflects the ongoing spiritual battle between truth and deception.<p><b>because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him</b><br>Tobiah and Sanballat were persistent adversaries of Nehemiah, representing external opposition to God's work. Their hiring of a false prophet illustrates the lengths to which enemies of God's people will go to thwart divine plans. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of opposition to God's purposes, as seen in the story of Balaam (Numbers 22-24). The hiring of a prophet for deceitful purposes also highlights the corrupting influence of money, a theme Jesus addresses in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
