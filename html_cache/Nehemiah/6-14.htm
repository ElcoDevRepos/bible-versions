Tobiah and Sanballat were prominent figures opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. Their opposition is documented throughout the book of Nehemiah, highlighting their persistent attempts to thwart Nehemiah's efforts (<a href="/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10, 4</a>:1-3). The invocation to "remember" is a call for divine retribution, a common theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). It reflects the belief that God is the ultimate judge who sees and acts upon the deeds of individuals. This plea for justice aligns with the biblical principle that vengeance belongs to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>).<p><b>and also Noadiah the prophetess</b><br>Noadiah is mentioned here as a prophetess who opposed Nehemiah. The inclusion of a female prophetess in this context is significant, as it shows that opposition came from various quarters, including religious figures. The role of prophetesses in Israel's history is notable, with figures like Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) and Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>) serving as leaders. However, Noadiah's actions contrast with these positive examples, as she is aligned with those trying to intimidate Nehemiah. This highlights the reality that not all who claim prophetic authority are aligned with God's purposes, a theme echoed in warnings against false prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>and the other prophets who tried to intimidate me</b><br>This phrase indicates that Nehemiah faced opposition not only from political leaders but also from religious figures. The mention of "other prophets" suggests a broader conspiracy against him, emphasizing the challenges he faced in his mission. The use of intimidation tactics by these prophets reflects a misuse of spiritual authority, reminiscent of the false prophets who opposed true prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15-17</a>). Nehemiah's discernment in recognizing and resisting these false messages underscores the importance of spiritual vigilance and reliance on God's guidance. This situation foreshadows the New Testament warnings about false teachers and prophets (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
