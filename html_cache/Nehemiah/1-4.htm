This reflects the importance of being attentive to the needs and conditions of God's people. The news he received was about the broken walls and burned gates of Jerusalem, symbolizing vulnerability and disgrace. This moment highlights the significance of being informed and responsive to the spiritual and physical state of the community.<p><b>I sat down and wept</b><br>Nehemiah's response is immediate and emotional, showing his deep compassion and connection to his heritage and God's people. Sitting down to weep indicates a profound sense of grief and empathy. This mirrors the biblical tradition of lament, seen in figures like Jeremiah, who also wept over Jerusalem's destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>). It underscores the importance of allowing oneself to feel and express sorrow over sin and its consequences.<p><b>I mourned for days</b><br>The extended period of mourning signifies the depth of Nehemiah's sorrow and his commitment to seeking God's intervention. Mourning in the ancient Near Eastern context often involved wearing sackcloth and ashes, practices that demonstrated humility and repentance. This aligns with the biblical call to mourn over sin and seek God's mercy, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>.<p><b>fasting and praying</b><br>Fasting and prayer are spiritual disciplines that demonstrate dependence on God and a desire for His guidance and intervention. Fasting is often associated with repentance and seeking God's favor, as seen in the practices of Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>). Prayer is a central theme in Nehemiah, reflecting his reliance on God throughout his mission. This combination of fasting and prayer indicates a holistic approach to seeking divine help.<p><b>before the God of heaven</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and His position as the ruler over all creation. Referring to God as the "God of heaven" emphasizes His power and authority, a common theme in post-exilic literature (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>). It reflects a recognition of God's ability to intervene in earthly matters and aligns with the biblical understanding of God as the ultimate source of help and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is deeply moved by the news of Jerusalem's desolation.

The prayer is a perfect example of the private and individual devotion with which the later Hebrew Scriptures abound. It begins with formal and appropriate invocation (<a href="/context/nehemiah/1-5.htm" title="And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:">Nehemiah 1:5-8</a>), flows into earnest confession (<a href="/context/nehemiah/1-6.htm" title="Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my father's house have sinned.">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a>), pleads the covenant promises (<a href="/context/nehemiah/1-8.htm" title="Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:">Nehemiah 1:8-10</a>), and supplicates a present answer (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.

The extant Scriptures, freely used, are the foundation of all.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Fasted.</span>--Like Daniel, Esther, and Ezra, Nehemiah fasted: fasting appears in later Judaism a prominent part of individual devotion, as it is in the New Testament.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Both I and my father's house have sinned.</span>--The supplication was for the nation; and in such cases of personal intercession the individual assumes the sin of all the past.<p>(8) The spirit of many threatenings and promises is summed up, as in the prayer of Nehemiah 9. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I heard these things, I sat down and wept</span>. The revelation of the actual condition of Jerusalem came upon Nehemiah with a shock. He had perhaps not thought much upon the subject before; he had had no means of exact information; he had supposed the city flourishing under the superintendence of Ezra, whose piety and patriotism were no doubt known to him. It was a bitter grief to him to find that his people were still "a reproach to their neighbours," laughed to scorn by those whose walls had never been destroyed, or who had been allowed to rebuild them. And he may have felt that his city, under the circumstances of the time, was in real danger. As Dean Stanley observes - "In those days rather one may say m those countries of disorder, a city without locked gates and lofty walls was no city at all" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, p. 124). A few years previously Egypt had been in revolt; she might revolt again, and carry her arms into Syria. Arab tribes from the desert might extend their raids into Judaea, and be tempted by the known value of the temple treasures to swoop upon the unwalled town. Such thoughts occurring to an excitable Oriental, produced not grief and anxiety merely, but a flood of tears (comp. <a href="/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fasted</span>. Fasting had become a frequent practice among the Jews during the captivity. Solemn fasts had been introduced on the anniversaries of the taking of Jerusalem, the burning of the temple, and the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). Fasting had also taken a prominent place in the devotions of individuals. Daniel fasted (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>); Esther fasted (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>); Ezra fasted (<a href="/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>); and now Nehemiah fasted. On the grounds of natural piety out of which the practice arises, see the comment on Ezra 10:6. <span class="cmt_word">The God of heaven</span>.
