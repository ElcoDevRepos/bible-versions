Oaths were serious commitments, often involving mutual support and loyalty. In the context of Nehemiah, these oaths could have been politically motivated, as Tobiah, the "him" referred to, was an adversary of Nehemiah. The binding nature of these oaths suggests a divided loyalty among the people of Judah, which posed a challenge to Nehemiah's leadership and the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem.<p><b>since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah</b><br>This indicates a familial connection that Tobiah had with influential families in Judah. Shecaniah, son of Arah, is mentioned here, and the family of Arah is listed among those who returned from exile (<a href="/ezra/2-5.htm">Ezra 2:5</a>). Such connections would have given Tobiah significant influence and access to the inner circles of Judah's society. Marriages were often used to solidify political alliances, and this connection would have strengthened Tobiah's position against Nehemiah's reforms.<p><b>and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah</b><br>This further illustrates the network of alliances through marriage. Meshullam son of Berechiah is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4</a> as one of the builders of the wall, indicating his involvement in the restoration efforts. The marriage between Jehohanan and Meshullam's daughter suggests a complex web of relationships that could complicate loyalties.
