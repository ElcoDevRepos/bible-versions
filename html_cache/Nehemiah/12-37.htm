This gate's proximity to water symbolizes cleansing and renewal, themes prevalent throughout Nehemiah's narrative of restoration. The gate's location underscores the importance of water in both physical sustenance and spiritual purification, reminiscent of Jesus' offer of "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>.<p><b>they went directly up the steps of the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, established by King David. The steps leading up to it highlight the elevation and significance of this area, which was the political and spiritual heart of Israel. This ascent signifies a return to foundational roots and a reclaiming of divine promises associated with David's reign, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7-9</a>.<p><b>on the ascent to the wall</b><br>The ascent to the wall indicates a movement towards protection and security. Walls in biblical times were crucial for a city's defense and identity. Nehemiah's rebuilding of the wall symbolizes the restoration of God's people and their covenant relationship with Him, echoing themes of protection found in <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<p><b>and passed above the house of David</b><br>Passing above the house of David signifies a connection to the Davidic lineage, which holds messianic significance. This lineage is crucial in biblical prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's throne forever, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>.<p><b>to the Water Gate on the east</b><br>The Water Gate's location on the east side of Jerusalem is significant, as the east often symbolizes new beginnings and divine intervention in Scripture. The Water Gate was a place where the Law was read to the people (<a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>), emphasizing the importance of God's Word in guiding and renewing His people. The eastward direction also alludes to the return of Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fountain_gate.htm">Fountain Gate</a></b><br>A significant gate in the wall of Jerusalem, symbolizing a place of cleansing and renewal.
