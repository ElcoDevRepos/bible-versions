Nehemiah had previously led reforms to address these issues, but during his absence, the people reverted to their old ways. This highlights the persistent struggle of the Israelites to maintain their covenant with God, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>I was not in Jerusalem</b><br>Nehemiah's absence from Jerusalem is significant because it underscores the importance of strong leadership in maintaining spiritual and social reforms. His leadership was crucial in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and instituting religious reforms. Without his presence, the people quickly fell back into disobedience, illustrating the need for continual guidance and accountability in spiritual matters.<p><b>because I had returned to Artaxerxes king of Babylon</b><br>Nehemiah had initially been granted permission by King Artaxerxes to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the city. His return to the king indicates his continued loyalty and duty to the Persian empire, which ruled over the region at the time. Artaxerxes is referred to as the king of Babylon, reflecting the historical context where the Persian Empire had absorbed the Babylonian territories. This also shows the geopolitical landscape of the time, where Jerusalem was under foreign rule.<p><b>in the thirty-second year of his reign</b><br>This provides a specific historical timeframe for Nehemiah's return to the Persian court, which is around 433 BC. The precision of this date helps to anchor the events of Nehemiah within the broader historical narrative of the Persian Empire and its interactions with the Jewish people. It also highlights the long duration of Artaxerxes' reign and the stability of his rule, which allowed for such administrative arrangements.<p><b>Some time later I obtained leave from the king</b><br>Nehemiah's ability to obtain leave again from Artaxerxes demonstrates the favor he held with the king and his influential position within the Persian administration. This leave was crucial for Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem and address the issues that had arisen in his absence. It reflects the providence of God in allowing Nehemiah to continue his mission of reform and restoration among the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader and cupbearer to King Artaxerxes, who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/artaxerxes.htm">Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who allowed Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem and later granted him leave again.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Nehemiah led the rebuilding efforts and implemented religious reforms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The location of King Artaxerxes' court, where Nehemiah served before and after his initial mission to Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reforms_in_jerusalem.htm">Reforms in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The context of Nehemiah's absence, during which the people of Jerusalem began to stray from the reforms he had instituted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Importance of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Nehemiah's leadership was crucial for the spiritual and physical restoration of Jerusalem.

Verse 6&#8217;s first phrase reminds us that these compromises took root &#8220;while&#8221; Nehemiah was gone. Spiritual lapses rarely erupt overnight; they grow when vigilance fades. Scripture consistently warns how quickly God&#8217;s people can drift: &#8220;For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart after other gods&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). Paul echoes the danger in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, warning believers not to be &#8220;unequally yoked.&#8221;<p>Key takeaway: Without continual shepherding, even a once-revived community slides into disobedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was not in Jerusalem</b><p>Nehemiah&#8217;s physical absence created a leadership vacuum. <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a> states, &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint&#8221;. We saw the same dynamic when Moses was on Sinai: &#8220;When the people saw that Moses delayed&#8230; they gathered around Aaron&#8221; and built the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>). God raises leaders not simply to start a work but to stay engaged, providing ongoing accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I had returned to Artaxerxes king of Babylon</b><p>Nehemiah had earlier served as cupbearer (<a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>), and he remained under Persian authority. His return shows respect for the ruler God had placed over him. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> affirms, &#8220;There is no authority except from God, and those that exist are appointed by God&#8221;. Daniel likewise served pagan kings faithfully while honoring the Lord (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). Nehemiah models how believers can submit to secular authority without compromising obedience to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the thirty-second year of his reign</b><p>This timestamp equals roughly twelve years after Nehemiah first came to Jerusalem (compare <a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). His long tenure underscores steady faithfulness. <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> urges, &#8220;Let us not grow weary in doing good&#8221;. Even so, ministry seasons may shift; Nehemiah needed to report back, illustrating that obedience includes closing one assignment before beginning the next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some time later I obtained leave from the king</b><p>The phrase &#8220;some time later&#8221; hints at waiting&#8212;perhaps months&#8212;before permission came. Yet <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases&#8221;. God turned Artaxerxes&#8217;s heart again, just as He had in <a href="/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a>, authorizing a fresh mission. Waiting on the Lord&#8217;s timing is never wasted: &#8220;Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a> shows how quickly God&#8217;s people can drift when godly oversight is removed, underscores a leader&#8217;s duty to honor earthly authority, and testifies that God directs pagan rulers to serve His redemptive plan.
