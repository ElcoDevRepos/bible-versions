In the context of rebuilding Jerusalem's walls, Nehemiah needed to assess the situation without interference or opposition. This approach reflects the wisdom seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, where careful planning is emphasized. The officials' ignorance underscores the potential for internal opposition, as seen in other biblical narratives like Joseph's brothers in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>.<p><b>for I had not yet told the Jews or priests or nobles or officials or any other workers</b><br>Nehemiah's decision to withhold information from these groups indicates a strategic approach to leadership. The Jews, priests, nobles, and officials represent various societal and religious hierarchies in Jerusalem. By not revealing his plans prematurely, Nehemiah avoided potential sabotage or discouragement, similar to how Jesus often instructed His disciples to keep certain revelations private until the appropriate time (e.g., <a href="/mark/9-9.htm">Mark 9:9</a>).
