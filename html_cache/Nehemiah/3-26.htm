Their origins trace back to the Gibeonites, who were made servants to the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). They played a crucial role in maintaining the daily operations of the temple, highlighting the importance of service and dedication in worship.<p><b>living on the hill of Ophel</b><br>Ophel refers to a fortified hill or a raised area in Jerusalem, located between the City of David and the Temple Mount. Archaeological findings have confirmed its significance in ancient Jerusalem, serving as a residential area for those involved in temple service. This location underscores the strategic and spiritual importance of proximity to the temple.<p><b>made repairs opposite the Water Gate</b><br>The Water Gate was one of the gates of Jerusalem, likely named for its proximity to the Gihon Spring or its role in water-related activities.

The Garden of Eden was planted in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the entrance to the tabernacle faced east (<a href="/exodus/27-13.htm">Exodus 27:13-16</a>). This orientation may symbolize hope and restoration for Jerusalem.<p><b>and the tower that juts out</b><br>Towers were essential for the defense of ancient cities, providing a vantage point for surveillance and protection. This particular tower's mention highlights the strategic importance of Jerusalem's defenses. In a spiritual sense, it can be seen as a metaphor for God's protection over His people, as seen in Psalms 61:3, where God is described as a strong tower.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_servants.htm">Temple Servants (Nethinim)</a></b><br>These were individuals assigned to assist the Levites in the service of the temple.
