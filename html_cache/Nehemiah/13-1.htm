The process here was that of shutting out heathens who were in the habit of mingling with the people in the services. In Nehemiah 9 it was, as we saw, the people's separation from the practices and spirit of the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On that day</span>.

It is uncertain whether this was a casual reading, like that of Ezra's, recorded in <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a>, or whether it was the prescribed reading (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>) at the time of the feast of tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">Therein was found written</span>. See <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-5</a>. It seems to be implied that the nation at large had no knowledge of the law, except that which they derived from the occasional public reading of the Pentateuch, or portions of it. Copies of the law were extremely scarce; and even if an ordinary Jew possessed one, he would not have been able to understand it (comp. above, <a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
