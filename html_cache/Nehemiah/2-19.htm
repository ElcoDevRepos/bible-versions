Sanballat was a Horonite, likely from Beth-Horon, a town in Samaria, indicating his Samaritan ties. Tobiah, an Ammonite, was connected to the ancient enemies of Israel, the Ammonites, who lived east of the Jordan River. Geshem the Arab represents the nomadic tribes from the Arabian Peninsula. Their opposition highlights the political and ethnic tensions surrounding Jerusalem's restoration. This opposition is reminiscent of the adversaries faced by the Israelites throughout their history, such as during the time of Ezra (<a href="/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>).<p><b>they mocked us and ridiculed us</b><br>Mockery and ridicule were common tactics used by opponents to demoralize and intimidate. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people often face scorn from those who oppose His plans (<a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>). The ridicule here serves to test the resolve and faith of Nehemiah and the Israelites, similar to how Jesus faced mockery during His ministry and crucifixion.<p><b>saying, &#8220;What is this you are doing?</b><br>The question implies disbelief and scorn, challenging the legitimacy and feasibility of Nehemiah's mission. It echoes the skepticism often faced by those undertaking God's work, as seen in the skepticism faced by Moses (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>) and the early church (<a href="/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>).<p><b>Are you rebelling against the king?&#8221;</b><br>This accusation of rebellion is serious, as it suggests treason against the Persian king, Artaxerxes, who had authority over the region. Historically, such accusations could lead to severe consequences, including military intervention. The charge of rebellion is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's people are often accused of defying earthly authorities when following divine directives (<a href="/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a>, <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). This foreshadows the ultimate allegiance to God's kingdom over earthly powers, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who was also accused of claiming kingship (<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat_the_horonite.htm">Sanballat the Horonite</a></b><br>A prominent opponent of Nehemiah, likely a governor of Samaria.

Note that Tobiah is present with Sanballat in Samaria on one occasion (<a href="/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>), and that Geshem and Sanballat propose a joint interview with Nehemiah on another (<a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They laughed us to scorn, and said</span>.
