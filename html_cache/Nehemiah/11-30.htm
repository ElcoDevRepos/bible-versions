Zanoah is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a> as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. Adullam is historically significant as the location of the cave where David sought refuge from King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>). The mention of "their villages" indicates the surrounding smaller settlements that were part of these towns' administrative regions. This reflects the post-exilic community's efforts to repopulate and restore the land of Judah after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>in Lachish and its fields;</b><br>Lachish was a major fortified city in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah. It played a significant role in the defense of the kingdom, as seen in its resistance against the Assyrian king Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-17</a>). Archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence of its destruction and subsequent rebuilding, aligning with biblical accounts. The "fields" of Lachish refer to the agricultural lands surrounding the city, essential for sustaining the population and economy.<p><b>and in Azekah and its villages.</b><br>Azekah was another fortified city in the Shephelah, known for its strategic military importance. It is mentioned in the context of battles, such as the one between the Israelites and the Philistines in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>, where David fought Goliath. The reference to "its villages" again highlights the network of smaller communities that supported the main city, emphasizing the restoration and repopulation efforts during Nehemiah's time.<p><b>So they settled from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom.</b><br>Beersheba, located in the southern part of Judah, was traditionally considered the southern boundary of Israel, often paired with Dan in the north (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). The Valley of Hinnom, near Jerusalem, marked the northern extent of the settled area. This phrase indicates the reestablishment of a continuous Jewish presence throughout the land, from the southernmost to the northernmost parts of Judah. The Valley of Hinnom later became associated with the concept of Gehenna, a place of judgment, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-48</a>). This settlement pattern reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people to their land, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zanoah.htm">Zanoah</a></b><br>A town in the lowlands of Judah, mentioned in the context of the resettlement of the people after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adullam.htm">Adullam</a></b><br>Known for the Cave of Adullam where David hid from King Saul, it is a significant historical and strategic location in Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lachish.htm">Lachish</a></b><br>A major fortified city in Judah, often mentioned in the context of military campaigns and conquests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/azekah.htm">Azekah</a></b><br>A town in the Shephelah region of Judah, known for its role in various battles, including the one where David fought Goliath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beersheba_to_the_valley_of_hinnom.htm">Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom</a></b><br>This phrase describes the geographical extent of the resettlement, from the southernmost part of Judah to the area near Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community_restoration.htm">The Importance of Community Restoration</a></b><br>The resettlement of these towns signifies the restoration of the community of Judah.

Its re-settlement testifies that the same Lord who granted the land to Joshua is restoring it after exile (<a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Adullam, where David once hid in a cave (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), reminds us that God preserves places of past deliverance so they can serve future generations. The villages surrounding these centers ensured agricultural stability, echoing the promise that obedient Israel would &#8220;eat the fruit of the land&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming both towns and their smaller settlements, Scripture underscores that every family and farm matters in God&#8217;s redemption story (<a href="/psalms/147-2.htm">Psalm 147:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Lachish and its fields</b><p>The next clause moves south-west to Lachish, a strategic fortress city (<a href="/joshua/10-31.htm">Joshua 10:31&#8211;32</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Fields accompany the city because security without sustenance is incomplete; God grants both (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Lachish had fallen to Assyria and later to Babylon, yet the returning Judeans plant there again, proving that no devastation can outlast God&#8217;s covenant mercies (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah warned Lachish to repent of idolatry (<a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>). Its inclusion here indicates repentance bore fruit, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise to &#8220;restore your fortunes before your eyes&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/3-20.htm">Zephaniah 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Azekah and its villages</b><p>Azekah, also in the Shephelah, once saw hailstones rain on Canaanite armies (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10&#8211;11</a>) and overlooked the valley where David faced Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Re-settling Azekah ties post-exilic Judah to earlier victories, reinforcing that the same God still fights for His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Villages around Azekah spread the population, securing farmland and trade routes. This mirrors God&#8217;s design for a balanced society&#8212;city, town, and countryside each playing a part (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they settled from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom</b><p>The closing line stretches the map: Beersheba marks the traditional southern border of Israel (<a href="/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>), while the Valley of Hinnom runs along Jerusalem&#8217;s southwestern edge (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows a continuous band of Judean life from the far south to the capital, fulfilling earlier calls to gather &#8220;from Beersheba to Dan&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-5.htm">2 Chronicles 30:5</a>) but now centering on Jerusalem&#8217;s worship.<p>&#8226; Occupying the land this broadly affirms God&#8217;s land-grant promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14&#8211;17</a>).

It had its own king in the time of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), and remained a city of some strength under the Maccabees (2 Macc. 12:38). <span class="cmt_word">Lachish</span> is a place even more celebrated than Adullam.
