Nehemiah's action here is a physical demonstration of the seriousness of the oath being taken. This gesture is similar to the New Testament practice where Jesus instructs His disciples to shake the dust off their feet as a testimony against those who do not receive them (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>). The robe, often a symbol of one's status and authority, underscores Nehemiah's leadership and the gravity of the situation.<p><b>&#8220;May God likewise shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise.</b><br>Nehemiah invokes a divine curse upon those who fail to uphold their commitment. This reflects the covenantal nature of Israel's relationship with God, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The reference to "house and possessions" highlights the comprehensive nature of the potential loss, affecting both personal and familial stability. This echoes the biblical principle that disobedience leads to divine judgment, as seen in the stories of Achan (Joshua 7) and Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5).<p><b>May such a man be shaken out and have nothing!&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of being "shaken out" suggests total expulsion and loss, akin to being cast out from the community. This reflects the severe consequences of breaking a vow, emphasizing the importance of integrity and faithfulness. The concept of having "nothing" aligns with the biblical theme of divine retribution for unfaithfulness, as seen in the parable of the talents where the unfaithful servant loses even what he has (<a href="/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28-29</a>).<p><b>The whole assembly said, &#8220;Amen,&#8221;</b><br>The term "Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," signifying agreement and affirmation. The collective response of the assembly indicates a communal commitment to the covenant and a shared understanding of the seriousness of the vow. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where the people affirm their covenant with God, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>, where the Israelites respond with "Amen" to the pronouncement of curses for disobedience.<p><b>and they praised the LORD.</b><br>Praising the LORD signifies acknowledgment of His sovereignty and righteousness. It reflects a recognition that the resolution of the issue at hand is ultimately an act of divine justice. This response is consistent with the biblical pattern of worship following deliverance or the reaffirmation of covenantal faithfulness, as seen in the songs of Moses (Exodus 15) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>).<p><b>And the people did as they had promised.</b><br>The fulfillment of the promise demonstrates the effectiveness of Nehemiah's leadership and the people's commitment to righteousness. This obedience is a testament to the transformative power of genuine repentance and communal accountability. It aligns with the biblical principle that true faith is evidenced by action, as articulated in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes and later became the governor of Judah.

The action pictures total emptiness&#8212;nothing left hiding inside.<p>&#8226; Similar symbolic gestures appear elsewhere: Paul &#8220;shook out his clothes&#8221; against hostile hearers (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>); Jesus told His disciples to &#8220;shake the dust off your feet&#8221; as a warning to unreceptive towns (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The lesson is plain: when God judges, nothing escapes His notice. Job says He can &#8220;shake the wicked out of it&#8221; when speaking of the earth (<a href="/job/38-13.htm">Job 38:13</a>).

And it is observable that the iniquity thus stopped is not referred to in the subsequent covenant (Nehemiah 10), nor is it one of the offences which the governor found on his second return (Nehemiah 13).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also I shook my lap</span>. Even the taking of the oath did not seem sufficient to the prudent governor. He would strengthen the oath by a malediction, and a malediction accompanied by a symbolical act, to render it the more impressive. Among the nations of antiquity few things were so much dreaded as falling under a curse. The maledictions of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-16.htm">Deuteronomy 28:16-44</a> were the supreme sanction which Moses devised for the Law, whereof he was the promulgator. Curses protected the tombs and inscriptions of the Assyrian and Persian kings, the contracts of the Babylonians, and the treaties of most nations. Nehemiah's curse is an unusual one, but very clear and intelligible. He prays that whosoever departs from his promise given may be cast forth a homeless wanderer, emptied of all his possessions, as empty as the fold in his own dress, which he first gathers into a sort of bag or pocket, and then throws from him and so empties out. To this the assembly responded by a hearty "Amen," and then <span class="cmt_word">praised the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> for the happy ending of the whole affair; in which they piously traced the directing and over-ruling hand of God, "restraining the fierceness of men," and "turning it to his praise" (<a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a> - Prayer-Book version). <p> CHAPTER 5:14-19 GENERAL ACCOUNT OF NEHEMIAH'S GOVERNMENT (vers. 14-19). Having given this account of the internal difficulties which threatened to put a stop to the building of the wall before it was well begun, and been led in the course of it to speak of the poverty and sufferings of the common people, Nehemiah not unnaturally goes on to inform us of the methods by which in his general government he endeavoured to alleviate the distress, or at any rate to avoid adding to the burthens which pressed upon the poorer classes. From the time that he entered upon his office, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, to the time of his writing this portion of his Book, in the thirty-second year of the same king, <span class="date">B.C. 432</span>, he had lived entirely at his own expense, requiring no contributions from the people, either in provisions or money, for the support of himself or his court (ver. 14). This was quite contrary to the previous practice of Jewish governors (ver. 15), and indeed of Oriental governors generally, whether under the Persian system or any other, such persons almost universally taxing their provinces, sometimes very heavily, for their current expenses, and often accumulating princely fortunes by their exactions. Nehemiah had also maintained a noble hospitality, of which he may be excused for being a little proud, during these twelve years of his governorship, entertaining daily at his table 150 of the chief inhabitants of Jerusalem, besides many foreign Jews who from time to time came on visits to the Judaean capital (vers. 17, 18). It is conjectured that he was able to take this course, and spend so largely without receiving any income from his province, because he retained his place of cupbearer, and as such drew a large salary from the Persian court (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 150, E. Tr.). However this may have been, he certainly disbursed large sums of money in Jerusalem, and must have done something to alleviate the general poverty by his lavish expenditure. He takes credit, further, for giving the services of his private attendants to the work of the wall during the whole time that it was in building (ver. 16), and for having abstained from the purchase of any land, when, through the general poverty, it might have been bought at a low price from those who were anxious to part with it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). HIS conduct beyond a doubt stood in the strongest contrast with that of the ordinary Persian satrap, or other governor, and we cannot be surprised that he looked on it with some complacency. He felt that he had done much for his people. He looked, however, for his reward not to them, not to man, but to God; and desired that his reward should be not present gratitude and thanks, not even posthumous fame, but God's approval and remembrance only (ver. 19).
