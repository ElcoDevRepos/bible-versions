In ancient Israel, villages were often agricultural hubs, essential for sustaining the population with food and resources. The mention of fields highlights the agrarian lifestyle of the people, which was central to their economy and daily life. The division of land into villages and fields reflects the tribal allotments given to the Israelites as described in the book of Joshua.<p><b>some of the people of Judah lived</b><br>The tribe of Judah was one of the largest and most prominent tribes of Israel, known for its leadership and strength. The reference to "some of the people" suggests a distribution of the population, with some remaining in Jerusalem while others settled in surrounding areas. This dispersion was necessary for the cultivation of land and maintaining the agricultural economy. It also reflects the post-exilic period's efforts to repopulate and restore the land after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>in Kiriath-arba</b><br>Kiriath-arba is another name for Hebron, one of the oldest cities in the region and a significant site in biblical history. It was associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were buried there. Hebron was a Levitical city and a city of refuge, highlighting its religious and cultural importance. The name "Kiriath-arba" means "City of Arba," referring to Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim, a race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament.<p><b>Dibon</b><br>Dibon, not to be confused with Dibon in Moab, was a town in the territory of Judah. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah. The mention of Dibon reflects the broader settlement patterns of the tribe of Judah and their efforts to reclaim and inhabit their ancestral lands after the exile.<p><b>Jekabzeel</b><br>Jekabzeel, also known as Kabzeel, was a town in the southern part of Judah. It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a> as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. The town's inclusion in this list underscores the comprehensive nature of the resettlement efforts, reaching even the more remote areas of the tribal territory.<p><b>and their villages</b><br>The phrase "and their villages" indicates that these towns were not isolated but were surrounded by smaller settlements. This reflects the typical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where a central town would be surrounded by smaller villages that supported it economically and socially. The mention of villages emphasizes the restoration and rebuilding of community life in the land of Judah, fulfilling the promises of return and restoration found in the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-arba.htm">Kiriath-arba</a></b><br>Also known as Hebron, this is a significant city in the history of Israel, being the burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
