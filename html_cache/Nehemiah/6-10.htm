The genealogy provided emphasizes the importance of lineage in Jewish culture, often used to establish credibility or authority. The mention of Shemaiah's confinement could also imply a sense of isolation, possibly hinting at his involvement in a conspiracy against Nehemiah. This setting underscores the tension and danger Nehemiah faced during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.<p><b>He said: &#8220;Let us meet at the house of God inside the temple.</b><br>The suggestion to meet in the temple is significant, as the temple was considered a sacred and secure place. However, Nehemiah, not being a priest, would have been violating the law by entering the temple's inner sanctum. This proposal tests Nehemiah's integrity and knowledge of the law, as only priests were allowed in certain areas of the temple (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). The temple's mention highlights its central role in Jewish life and worship, serving as a place of refuge and divine presence.<p><b>Let us shut the temple doors because they are coming to kill you&#8212;</b><br>The advice to shut the temple doors implies a sense of immediate threat and urgency. This tactic is meant to instill fear in Nehemiah, pushing him to act against his principles. The temple doors symbolize protection and sanctuary, yet the suggestion to close them for personal safety rather than worship or reverence reveals the manipulative intent behind Shemaiah's counsel. This reflects the broader theme of opposition Nehemiah faced from external and internal enemies during his mission.<p><b>by night they are coming to kill you!&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on an attack "by night" plays on the fear of the unknown and the vulnerability associated with darkness. Nighttime was often associated with danger and evil in biblical literature (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). This warning is designed to create panic and prompt Nehemiah to act irrationally. Nehemiah's discernment in recognizing the deceitful nature of this warning demonstrates his reliance on God for wisdom and protection, aligning with the biblical theme of trusting in God's providence over human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
