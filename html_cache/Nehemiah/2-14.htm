This gate was significant for its proximity to water sources, which were vital for the city's survival. In biblical symbolism, fountains often represent life and cleansing, drawing a parallel to spiritual renewal. The Fountain Gate's mention highlights Nehemiah's strategic inspection of the city's defenses and resources, emphasizing the importance of water in both physical and spiritual sustenance.<p><b>and the King&#8217;s Pool</b><br>The King's Pool is likely another name for the Pool of Siloam, which was an essential water reservoir for Jerusalem. This pool was fed by the Gihon Spring through Hezekiah's Tunnel, a remarkable engineering feat of the time. The pool's association with royalty suggests its importance and possibly its use by the king's household. In the New Testament, the Pool of Siloam is where Jesus healed a man born blind (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>), symbolizing spiritual sight and enlightenment.<p><b>but there was no room for the animal under me to get through;</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of the destruction and debris that Nehemiah encountered. The rubble was so significant that it obstructed his passage, underscoring the challenges he faced in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. This imagery of obstruction can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral decay that needed addressing. Nehemiah's determination to continue despite these obstacles reflects the perseverance required in spiritual leadership and restoration. The mention of the animal also highlights the practical difficulties of the task, emphasizing the need for divine guidance and strength in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is leading the effort to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fountain_gate.htm">Fountain Gate</a></b><br>A gate in the wall of Jerusalem, likely near the Gihon Spring, which was a crucial water source for the city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king's_pool.htm">King&#8217;s Pool</a></b><br>Possibly the Pool of Siloam, an important water reservoir in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God&#8217;s chosen people, which had been destroyed and was in need of restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah's_mount.htm">Nehemiah&#8217;s Mount</a></b><br>The animal Nehemiah was riding, which could not pass through due to the rubble and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_the_face_of_obstacles.htm">Perseverance in the Face of Obstacles</a></b><br>Nehemiah&#8217;s journey was physically blocked, yet he continued his mission.
