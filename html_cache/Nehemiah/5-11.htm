Nehemiah, as governor, is addressing the nobles and officials who have been exploiting their fellow Jews. The immediacy underscores the importance of justice and compassion in the community. This reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and the urgency of rectifying wrongs, as seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>.<p><b>their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses</b><br>These items represent the basic means of livelihood and sustenance for the people. In ancient Israel, land was a critical asset, often tied to family inheritance and identity (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>). The loss of these properties due to debt or exploitation would have severe economic and social implications. The restoration of these assets is a return to the God-given order and provision for each family, as seen in the Jubilee laws (Leviticus 25).<p><b>along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and oil</b><br>This refers to the interest or usury that had been unjustly charged. The Law of Moses prohibited charging interest to fellow Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>), emphasizing community solidarity and care for the poor. The mention of grain, wine, and oil highlights the staples of the ancient Near Eastern diet and economy, underscoring the comprehensive nature of the exploitation.<p><b>that you have been assessing them</b><br>The term "assessing" implies a systematic and perhaps legalistic imposition of burdens. This reflects a broader theme in Scripture where leaders are called to act justly and not oppress the people (<a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>, <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).
