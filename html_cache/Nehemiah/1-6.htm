It echoes Solomon's prayer in <a href="/2_chronicles/6-40.htm">2 Chronicles 6:40</a>, where he asks God to be attentive to the prayers made in the temple. This request for divine attention underscores the belief in a personal God who is actively involved in the lives of His people.<p><b>to hear the prayer that I, Your servant, now pray before You</b><br>Nehemiah identifies himself as God's servant, a term that denotes humility and submission to God's will. This aligns with the biblical tradition of leaders like Moses and David, who also referred to themselves as servants of God. The act of prayer is central to Nehemiah's leadership, demonstrating reliance on divine guidance rather than solely on human wisdom.<p><b>day and night</b><br>The phrase "day and night" indicates the fervency and persistence of Nehemiah's prayer. It reflects the biblical principle of continual prayer found in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, which encourages believers to "pray without ceasing." This persistent prayer life is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of constant communication with God.<p><b>for Your servants, the Israelites</b><br>Nehemiah's intercession for the Israelites highlights his role as a mediator, similar to figures like Moses and Daniel, who also prayed on behalf of their people. This communal aspect of prayer reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the fate of the nation is intertwined with the faithfulness of its leaders and people.<p><b>I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against You</b><br>Confession is a critical component of Nehemiah's prayer, acknowledging the collective sin of the nation. This mirrors the confessions found in <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> and <a href="/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9</a>, where leaders confess the sins of the people as a step toward restoration. It underscores the biblical theme of repentance as a prerequisite for divine forgiveness and blessing.<p><b>Both I and my father&#8217;s house have sinned</b><br>Nehemiah includes himself and his family in the confession, demonstrating personal accountability and humility. This personal acknowledgment of sin is consistent with the biblical understanding that all have sinned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>) and need God's grace. It also reflects the communal nature of sin in the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals and families impact the entire community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is the central figure in this book.

Ewald well observes, "In the prayer of Nehemiah the keynote is struck in the words, 'I and my father's house have sinned'" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 149, note 1). The desolation which he mourns is the result of the people's sins, and in those sins are included his own, and those of his ancestors. His own may not have been very grievous, but those of his fathers weigh upon him as if his own, and oppress his spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">may Your eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1462;&#1450;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
