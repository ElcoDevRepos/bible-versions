The use of choirs in worship is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the communal aspect of praise (e.g., <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). The direction "to the left" suggests a specific route, highlighting the detailed planning involved in the dedication of the wall. This procession is part of a larger celebration of the completion of the wall, a significant achievement for the returned exiles, symbolizing God's faithfulness and protection.<p><b>and I followed it with half the people</b><br>Nehemiah's leadership is evident as he personally participates in the procession, demonstrating humility and solidarity with the people. The division of the people into two groups may symbolize unity and balance, ensuring that the entire community is involved in the celebration. This division also reflects the practical need to manage a large group effectively during the procession. Nehemiah's role as a leader who leads by example is consistent with biblical principles of servant leadership (e.g., <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><b>along the top of the wall</b><br>Walking on top of the wall signifies the strength and stability of the structure, a testament to the successful completion of Nehemiah's project. This act serves as a public declaration of God's provision and protection, as the wall was a crucial defense for the city. The wall's completion fulfilled the prophecy and promise of restoration for Jerusalem (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). The physical act of walking on the wall also symbolizes the spiritual fortification of the community.<p><b>past the Tower of the Ovens</b><br>The Tower of the Ovens is a specific landmark in Jerusalem, likely named for its proximity to the area where bread was baked. This detail provides insight into the daily life and economy of the city, as bread was a staple food. The mention of such landmarks underscores the historical and geographical accuracy of the account. It also highlights the integration of worship with everyday life, as the procession moves through familiar and essential parts of the city.<p><b>to the Broad Wall</b><br>The Broad Wall is an archaeological feature in Jerusalem, identified as a massive fortification built during the reign of King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7-8</a>). Its mention here connects the current celebration with the city's past, reminding the people of God's enduring protection and the continuity of His promises. The Broad Wall's construction was a response to the Assyrian threat, and its inclusion in the procession route symbolizes the enduring strength and resilience of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king who became the governor of Jerusalem.

Two choirs had been appointed (v. 31), not for mere pageantry but to offer literal, audible praise as they encircled Jerusalem. This mirrored earlier moments when God&#8217;s people gave thanks aloud, such as <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>, &#8220;They sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD.&#8221; By arranging two choirs, Nehemiah underlined the completeness of the worship&#8212;praise rising from both directions&#8212;much like the antiphonal songs of <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>. The physical act of thanksgiving validated the covenant promises that had restored the city (<a href="/psalms/147-2.htm">Psalm 147:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Proceeded to the left</b><p>One choir moved right (v. 38&#8217;s counterpart in v. 37), the second &#8220;to the left.&#8221; The route&#8217;s symmetry displayed order and balance in worship, echoing the orderly processions around Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3&#8211;4</a>. Direction here is not incidental; it declares that every part of the wall&#8212;and every resident within&#8212;is claimed for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12&#8211;14</a>). Movement leftward also places the choirs on opposite paths that will ultimately converge at the temple (v. 40), depicting unity out of diversity (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I followed it with half the people</b><p>Nehemiah himself &#8220;followed&#8221; the choir, emphasizing servant leadership. He does not stand aloof; he joins the procession. Half the populace accompanies him, while the other half follows the first choir (v. 38), illustrating shared responsibility. Similar participation is seen in <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, where Moses leads Israel under God&#8217;s banner, and in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>, where shepherds are told to lead by example. The scene highlights how leaders and laity alike must walk in gratitude, side by side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along the top of the wall</b><p>The people walk &#8220;along the top of the wall,&#8221; a decisive rebuttal to their enemies&#8217; ridicule: &#8220;Even if a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their stone wall&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>). Now entire choirs march on that same wall, proving God&#8217;s work stands firm (<a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>). Their footsteps turn former scorn into testimony, echoing <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>: &#8220;The LORD is my fortress&#8230; my stronghold.&#8221; The wall supports them because the Lord Himself supports both wall and worshiper (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Past the Tower of the Ovens</b><p>They pass &#8220;the Tower of the Ovens,&#8221; a landmark mentioned earlier in <a href="/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>. Ovens were where daily bread was baked; passing this spot reminded the worshipers that God not only restores walls but also provides every meal (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). The tower&#8217;s presence in the dedication route connects spiritual celebration with everyday life, much like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a> commands thanksgiving &#8220;when you have eaten and are satisfied.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the Broad Wall</b><p>Their journey ends at &#8220;the Broad Wall,&#8221; a massive western fortification rebuilt after the exile (<a href="/nehemiah/3-8.htm">Nehemiah 3:8</a>). Once breached, it now stands wide and secure, embodying <a href="/isaiah/60-18.htm">Isaiah 60:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;You will call your walls Salvation.&#8221; Walking to this point publicly declares that God&#8217;s salvation is as broad and accessible as the wall itself (<a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>). The route&#8217;s conclusion assures every onlooker that what God rebuilds, He also guards (<a href="/psalms/147-13.htm">Psalm 147:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/12-38.htm">Nehemiah 12:38</a> paints a literal procession of praise: a second choir moves left, Nehemiah and half the people join them, they confidently tread the rebuilt wall, pass practical landmarks, and finish at the Broad Wall. Each detail celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;from restoring leadership and unity, to proving the wall&#8217;s strength, to providing daily bread, to securing the city&#8217;s widest defenses. The verse calls believers today to visible, wholehearted thanksgiving that marches through every part of life, proclaiming that what God has rebuilt in Christ is firm, complete, and worthy of joyful dedication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">The other company.</span>--Comparing the order with Nehemiah 3, the reader will have a clear view of the second company. They had the longer route, proceed. ing to the left, rounding the north "broad wall," passing the sheep-gate, and so meeting the priestly company near the prison-gate. The space where they met had the Temple straight in front, the prison-gate on the right, and the water-gate on the left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38, 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the other company</span>. Nehemiah now proceeds to trace the course of the other choir or procession - the one which he himself accompanied. Starting from the same part of the western wall as the other, its course was northward to the N.W. angle of the city wall, after which it was eastward to the "sheep gate, and then southward to the "prison gate." In this part of his description Nehemiah traces the same portion of the wall as that which had engaged his attention in <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-11</a>, and mentions almost exactly the same features, but <span class="accented">in the reverse order. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For the tower of the furnaces</span> see <a href="/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>; <span class="cmt_word">for the broad wall</span>, ver. 8; <span class="cmt_word">for the old gate</span>, ver. 6; <span class="cmt_word">for the fish gate</span>, ver. 3; <span class="cmt_word">for the tower of Hananeel, the tower of Meah, and the sheep</span> gate, ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">gate of Ephraim</span> is not mentioned in ch. 3.
