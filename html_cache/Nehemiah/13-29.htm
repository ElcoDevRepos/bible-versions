Nehemiah calls upon God to remember the actions of those who have acted against His commands. This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek God's remembrance as a form of divine retribution or blessing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>). The invocation of God&#8217;s memory is significant, as it implies trust in God&#8217;s omniscience and justice. It also echoes the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where God&#8217;s remembrance often leads to action on behalf of His covenant.<p><b>because they have defiled the priesthood</b><br>The defilement of the priesthood refers to the corruption and unfaithfulness of the religious leaders. In the context of Nehemiah, this likely involves the priests' failure to maintain the sanctity and purity required by the Law of Moses. The priesthood was central to Israel's worship and relationship with God, serving as mediators between God and the people (Exodus 28-29). Defilement here could include allowing foreign influences or neglecting temple duties, which Nehemiah sought to reform (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4-9</a>).<p><b>and the covenant of the priesthood</b><br>The covenant of the priesthood refers to the special agreement between God and the descendants of Aaron, the first high priest, and the Levites. This covenant is detailed in passages like <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a> and <a href="/malachi/2-4.htm">Malachi 2:4-8</a>, where God promises a perpetual priesthood in exchange for faithfulness and service. Violating this covenant would have serious spiritual and communal implications, as it undermines the very foundation of Israel's worship system.<p><b>and of the Levites</b><br>The Levites were a tribe set apart for religious duties, assisting the priests and maintaining the temple (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). Their role was crucial in the spiritual life of Israel, and any defilement or neglect of their duties would disrupt the proper worship of God. Nehemiah's concern highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity and holiness of those who serve in God's house. This also points to the broader biblical theme of holiness and the need for God's people to be set apart (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community.

He calls God to remember the offenders, identifies the specific sin&#8212;defiling the priesthood and covenant&#8212;and underscores the communal damage done to the Levites&#8217; ministry.

We look in vain for any distinct "covenant" which the priestly order broke by allying itself with the heathen, or indeed for any special law forbidding the priests to take heathen wives, which was not equally binding upon laymen. But Nehemiah feels that every sin is worse in a priest than in one who is not a priest; that a priest who contracts a pollution "pollutes the priesthood;" and that there is a tacit covenant by which priests and Levites bind themselves to holiness of life more absolutely and definitely than others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/13-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Remember</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
