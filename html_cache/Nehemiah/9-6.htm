In the context of Nehemiah, this declaration comes during a time of national repentance and renewal, as the Israelites return from exile and reaffirm their covenant with God. The exclusivity of God as the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."<p><b>You created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their host,</b><br>This acknowledges God as the Creator of the universe, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, beginning with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. The "highest heavens" refers to the spiritual realm beyond the visible sky, often associated with God's dwelling place. The "host" includes celestial bodies and possibly angelic beings, as seen in <a href="/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2-4</a>, which calls on the heavenly host to praise God.<p><b>the earth and all that is on it,</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty over the physical world, including all living creatures and natural resources. It reflects the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates the earth and everything in it. This also implies stewardship, as humanity is tasked with caring for God's creation (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>).<p><b>the seas and all that is in them.</b><br>The mention of the seas highlights God's dominion over the chaotic and mysterious aspects of creation, often symbolized by the sea in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25-26</a>, which describes the sea as teeming with creatures made by God. The seas also represent God's power to control and calm chaos, as seen in Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.<p><b>You give life to all things,</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's role as the sustainer of life, not just the creator. It reflects the belief that all life is dependent on God's ongoing provision and care, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>, where Paul states that God "gives all men life and breath and everything else." This also points to the spiritual life given through Christ, who is described as the life-giver in <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>.<p><b>and the host of heaven worships You.</b><br>This final phrase depicts the worship of God by the heavenly beings, emphasizing His supreme authority and glory. The "host of heaven" likely refers to angels and other celestial beings, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>, where countless angels surround the throne of God, praising Him. This worship is a model for earthly worship, calling believers to join in the adoration of the Creator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls after the Babylonian exile.
