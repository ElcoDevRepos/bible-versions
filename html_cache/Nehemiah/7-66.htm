The term "assembly" is often used in the Old Testament to describe the gathered people of Israel, emphasizing their unity and shared purpose. This assembly was significant as it represented the remnant of God's chosen people, fulfilling prophecies of return and restoration found in books like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The gathering of the assembly also prefigures the New Testament concept of the church as the body of Christ, a spiritual assembly of believers.<p><b>numbered</b><br>The act of numbering or taking a census was a common practice in ancient Israel, often used to organize the people for military, religious, or administrative purposes. In this context, the numbering signifies the importance of each individual in the community and the careful record-keeping that was necessary for the restoration efforts. It reflects the biblical theme of God's knowledge and care for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>, where God is said to count the stars and call them by name.<p><b>42360</b><br>This specific number highlights the substantial size of the returning group, indicating a significant portion of the Jewish population was committed to rebuilding their homeland. The precision of the number underscores the historical reliability of the account. This figure is also mentioned in <a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>, showing consistency between the two books, which both detail the return from exile. The number 42,360, while large, also suggests that many Israelites remained in Babylon, illustrating the challenges of re-establishing the nation. Theologically, this remnant is a type of the faithful remnant theme found throughout Scripture, pointing to those who remain true to God amidst adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah was instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and reforming the community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and identity, Jerusalem had been in ruins after the Babylonian exile and was being restored under Nehemiah's leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>Refers to the collective group of Israelites who returned from exile to Jerusalem and Judah.

Much like &#8220;the remnant&#8221; in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20&#8211;22</a>, &#8220;the&#8221; signals that what follows is God-selected, not random.<p>- <a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a> shows the LORD stirring &#8220;the&#8221; heads of the families to return; Nehemiah picks up that same thought, reminding us that God is still directing events.<p>- By using &#8220;the,&#8221; Scripture highlights God&#8217;s ownership. <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> says, &#8220;It is He who made us, and we are His.&#8221; The returnees belong to Him; their story is His story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whole assembly</b><p>- God is painting a picture of unity. Like <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>, where &#8220;the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel&#8221; slaughters the Passover lamb together, the exiles now stand as one people.<p>- This unity reaffirms covenant identity after decades in Babylon. <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a> foretold a renewed covenant written on hearts; gathering &#8220;the whole assembly&#8221; previews that promise coming to life.<p>- <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a> echoes the same spirit centuries later: &#8220;All the believers were together and had everything in common.&#8221; The Lord delights in collective obedience, not isolated spirituality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>numbered</b><p>- Counting God&#8217;s people is not mere bureaucracy; it is covenant bookkeeping. <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a> opens with a census &#8220;according to their clans,&#8221; underscoring order and responsibility in God&#8217;s community.<p>- Each person matters. Jesus affirms this principle in <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>: &#8220;Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.&#8221; If God numbers hairs, He certainly knows every exile by name.<p>- Recording the count also testifies to fulfilled prophecy. <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11&#8211;12</a> promised the Lord would &#8220;recover the remnant of His people&#8221; and &#8220;assemble the banished of Israel.&#8221; The tally proves He has done exactly that.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>42,360</b><p>- The figure is literal&#8212;Scripture presents it straightforwardly in both <a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66</a> and the parallel <a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>. God keeps precise track of His promises.<p>- Though sizeable, the number is small compared to Israel&#8217;s earlier census totals (<a href="/bsb/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a> lists 601,730 fighting men). The contrast underlines grace: after judgment, the Lord still preserves a meaningful remnant.<p>- The mix of families, priests, Levites, and temple servants within this total (<a href="/nehemiah/7-67.htm">Nehemiah 7:67&#8211;73</a>) shows a complete yet dependent community. Like <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12&#8211;14</a>, many parts form one body.<p>- The figure also anticipates growth. <a href="/zechariah/8-4.htm">Zechariah 8:4&#8211;5</a> envisions streets filled with boys and girls again&#8212;future increase grounded in this initial remnant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66</a> records more than a headcount. &#8220;The&#8221; marks God&#8217;s ownership, &#8220;whole assembly&#8221; showcases covenant unity, &#8220;numbered&#8221; reflects divine care and order, and &#8220;42,360&#8221; affirms a literal, fulfilled promise&#8212; a small but sufficient remnant through whom God will rebuild both walls and worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore</span>. It makes against the view of Bishop Patrick and others, who regard Ezra's list as made at Babylon, some time before the final departure, and Nehemiah's as made at Jerusalem, after the arrival of the exiles, that the sum total is in each case the same (see <a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>). Bishop Kennicott's theory, that the three lists - that of Ezra, that of Nehemiah, and that in the first of Esdras - had all one original, and that the existing differences proceed entirely from mistakes of the copyists, is the only tenable one. It is especially remarkable that the differences in the numbers of the three lists consist chiefly <span class="accented">in a single unit, a single ten, or a single hundred</span> - or in a five; less often in two units, or two tens, or two hundreds, or in a six - differences probably arising from the obliteration of one or two signs in a notation resembling the Roman or the Egyptian, where there are special signs for a thousand, a hundred, ten, five, and the unit, complex numbers being expressed by repetition of these, as 3438 in Latin inscriptions by MMMCCCCXXXVIII. Any fading of a sign in such a notation as this causes a copyist to diminish the amount by one, five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, etc. A fading of two sigmas may produce a diminution of two thousand, two hundred, twenty, two; or again of eleven hundred, one hundred and ten, one hundred and five, fifteen, eleven, six, and the like. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">assembly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#257;&#183;h&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6951.htm">Strong's 6951: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assembly, convocation, congregation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[numbered]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">42,360 {},</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">OT History: Nehemiah 7:66 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand (Neh Ne) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/nehemiah/7-65.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Nehemiah 7:65"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 7:65" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/nehemiah/7-67.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Nehemiah 7:67"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 7:67" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
