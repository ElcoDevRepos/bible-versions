Jerusalem, the city of David, holds immense historical and spiritual significance as the center of Jewish worship and identity. Nehemiah's journey from Susa, the Persian capital, to Jerusalem was approximately 900 miles, a testament to his dedication and the providence of God in allowing him to undertake such a mission. This journey echoes the return of the exiles under Zerubbabel and Ezra, highlighting the ongoing fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people to their land (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p><b>and had been there three days</b><br>The mention of three days is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a period of preparation or transition. Nehemiah's three-day stay before taking action suggests a time of rest, reflection, and perhaps prayer, aligning with the biblical pattern of seeking God's guidance before undertaking significant tasks (<a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). This period also allowed Nehemiah to acclimate to the city and assess the situation firsthand. The number three is frequently associated with completeness and divine intervention, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day, symbolizing new beginnings and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is the central figure in this passage.

STEPS TAKEN BY NEHEMIAH PRELIMINARY TO HIS BUILDING OF THE WALL, AND FIRST APPEARANCE OF OPPOSITION (<a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12-20</a>). Hitherto Nehemiah had communicated his purpose to no one but the king and queen of Persia. He expected opposition, and resolved to baffle his opponents, as long as possible, by concealing his exact designs. Even when further concealment was on the point of becoming impossible, he made his survey of the wall by night, that it might escape observation. At last, the time for action being come, he was obliged to lay the matter before the head men of the city (ver. 17), whom he easily persuaded when he assured them of Artaxerxes' consent and goodwill Preparations then began to be made; and immediately murmurs of opposition arose. Three opponents are now spoken of - Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arabian, Geshem or Gashmu, not previously mentioned. These persons appear to have sent a formal message to the authorities of Jerualem (ver. 19), taxing them with an intention to rebel Nehemiah made no direct reply to this charge, but boldly stated his resolve to "arise and build," and denied Sanballat's right to interfere with him (ver. 20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After I arrived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
