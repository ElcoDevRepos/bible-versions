The "rest" refers to times when God delivered Israel from their enemies, providing them with peace. This pattern is evident throughout the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly turned away from God after experiencing deliverance and rest (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>). It underscores the human tendency to forget God in times of comfort and security.<p><b>they again did evil in Your sight</b><br>The phrase "did evil in Your sight" indicates a return to sinful behaviors and idolatry, which were common issues for Israel. This evil often involved worshiping foreign gods and neglecting the covenant with Yahweh. The phrase "in Your sight" emphasizes that their actions were not hidden from God, who is omniscient. This cycle of sin is a central theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the need for repentance and the consequences of disobedience (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-6.htm">1 Kings 11:6</a>).<p><b>So You abandoned them to the hands of their enemies</b><br>God's abandonment here is a form of divine judgment, allowing Israel to experience the consequences of their actions. This is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to oppression by foreign nations. Historically, this occurred during various invasions and captivities, such as the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. It serves as a reminder of God's justice and the seriousness of turning away from Him.<p><b>who had dominion over them</b><br>The dominion of enemies over Israel is a fulfillment of the warnings given by the prophets and the Mosaic Law. This dominion often involved harsh oppression and servitude, as seen in the accounts of the Philistines, Moabites, and Babylonians. It reflects the loss of autonomy and blessing that comes from breaking the covenant with God. This dominion is also a type of spiritual bondage that sin brings into the lives of believers.<p><b>When they cried out to You again</b><br>This phrase signifies repentance and a turning back to God in times of distress. The act of crying out is a common response in the Old Testament when Israel recognizes their sin and seeks God's mercy (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>). It highlights God's readiness to listen to His people when they genuinely seek Him, demonstrating His patience and willingness to forgive.<p><b>You heard from heaven</b><br>God's hearing from heaven indicates His attentiveness and readiness to respond to the cries of His people. Heaven is depicted as God's dwelling place, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority. This phrase reassures believers of God's accessibility and His desire to intervene in human affairs when approached with a contrite heart (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><b>and You delivered them many times in Your compassion</b><br>God's deliverance is an act of grace and mercy, underscoring His compassionate nature. Despite Israel's repeated failures, God remains faithful to His covenant promises. This deliverance is seen throughout the history of Israel, from the Exodus to the return from Babylonian exile. It points to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides salvation from sin and eternal life (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who repeatedly turned away from Him, yet cried out for deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The foreign nations that God allowed to rule over the Israelites as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The compassionate and merciful deity who hears the cries of His people and delivers them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The leader who helped rebuild Jerusalem's walls and led the people in spiritual renewal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, from where He hears and responds to the cries of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_sin_and_redemption.htm">The Cycle of Sin and Redemption</a></b><br>Recognize the pattern of sin, consequence, repentance, and deliverance in our own lives.

it means He removes protective favor and lets consequences run their course.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a> foretold, &#8220;My anger will flare against them on that day, and I will forsake them.&#8221;<p>&#8226;
