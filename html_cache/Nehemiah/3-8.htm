Goldsmiths were highly regarded for their craftsmanship and precision, often working with valuable materials. Their involvement in construction highlights the communal effort and the willingness of all societal classes to participate in the restoration of Jerusalem's walls. This reflects the unity and dedication of the people, reminiscent of the body of Christ working together with diverse gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>And next to him, Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs.</b><br>Hananiah, a perfumer, signifies the inclusion of various trades in the rebuilding process. Perfumers were responsible for creating incense and anointing oils, essential for worship and daily life in ancient Israel. Their participation underscores the spiritual significance of the work, as the restoration of the walls was not just a physical task but a spiritual renewal. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings restoration and healing, much like the fragrant offerings in the temple (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>They fortified Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.</b><br>The Broad Wall is an archaeological feature in Jerusalem, believed to have been constructed during the reign of King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7-8</a>) to protect the city from Assyrian invasion. Its mention here indicates the strategic importance of this section of the wall and the thoroughness of Nehemiah's rebuilding efforts. The fortification of Jerusalem symbolizes the protection and security found in God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to His people. This act of rebuilding can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate protection and salvation offered through Jesus Christ, the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziel_son_of_harhaiah.htm">Uzziel son of Harhaiah</a></b><br>A goldsmith involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall.
