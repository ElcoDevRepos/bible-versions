Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah are listed among the Levites who returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel and Jeshua (<a href="/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43</a>). Their return signifies the restoration of proper worship practices in Jerusalem. Jeshua is often associated with the high priest Jeshua, who helped rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). Kadmiel and Binnui are mentioned in <a href="/ezra/3-9.htm">Ezra 3:9</a> as leaders in the rebuilding efforts. Sherebiah is noted for his role in teaching the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>).

The songs of thanksgiving were an integral part of Israel's worship, expressing gratitude for God's deliverance and provision. This practice is seen in the Psalms, which often include themes of thanksgiving (e.g., <a href="/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100</a>). The role of music in worship is further emphasized in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).

Their God-given task included guarding holiness (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>) and facilitating worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). By listing them first, Nehemiah underscores that the restoration of Jerusalem was incomplete without restored worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeshua</b><p>Jeshua (also called Joshua) appears repeatedly as a leading Levite (<a href="/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>; 12:24). Along with Zerubbabel, he had earlier helped rebuild the altar (<a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>).

Each name testifies to steady faithfulness, while their collective role spotlights the priority of organized, heartfelt thanksgiving in Israel&#8217;s communal life.
