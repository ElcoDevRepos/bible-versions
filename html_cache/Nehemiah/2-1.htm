It is the first month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, marking the beginning of spring and the time of Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). This timing is significant as it symbolizes new beginnings and deliverance, paralleling Nehemiah's mission to rebuild Jerusalem.<p><b>in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes</b><br>King Artaxerxes I reigned from 465-424 BC. The twentieth year of his reign would be around 445 BC. Artaxerxes was a Persian king, and his reign is noted for its relative stability and support of the Jewish people, as seen in his authorization of Nehemiah's mission. This historical context highlights the providence of God in using foreign rulers to fulfill His purposes for Israel.<p><b>when wine was set before him</b><br>Wine was a common beverage in the Persian court, often associated with royal banquets and official duties. Nehemiah, as the cupbearer, had the responsibility of ensuring the king's wine was safe, a position of trust and influence. This setting underscores the importance of Nehemiah's role and the risk involved in approaching the king with a personal request.<p><b>I took the wine and gave it to the king</b><br>Nehemiah's role as cupbearer was not just about serving drinks; it was a position of significant trust and intimacy with the king. This access provided Nehemiah with a unique opportunity to influence the king, reflecting how God places His people in strategic positions for His purposes, similar to Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>).<p><b>I had never been sad in his presence</b><br>Displaying sadness before the king was risky, as it could be seen as a sign of disloyalty or dissatisfaction. Nehemiah's emotional state reveals the depth of his concern for Jerusalem and his people. This moment of vulnerability sets the stage for his bold request, demonstrating faith and courage. It also foreshadows the compassion of Christ, who wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian King Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is a key figure in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

As we are still in the twentieth year of the king, the beginning of his reign must be dated before Chisleu.

The fourth month after Chisleu, corresponding nearly to our April. How it came about that Nehemiah did not put the king's favour to the proof until more than three months had gone by we can only conjecture. Perhaps the court had been absent from Susa, passing the winter at Babylon, as it sometimes did, and he had not accompanied it. Perhaps, though present at the court, he had not been called on to discharge his office, his turn not having arrived. Possibly, though performing his duties from time to time, he had found no opportunity of unbosoming himself, the king not having noticed his grief. He. may even have done his best to conceal it, for Persian subjects were expected to be perfectly happy in the presence of their king. He had probably formed no plan, but waited in the confident hope that God's providence would so order events, that some occasion would arise whereof he might take advantage. <span class="cmt_word">In the twentieth year of Artaxerxes</span>. Like Daniel, Zechariah, Haggai, and Ezra, Nehemiah dates events by the regnal year of the existing Persian king. His Artaxerxes is, by common consent, the same as Ezra's, and can scarcely be supposed to be any monarch but Longimanus, who reigned from <span class="date">B.C. 465</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 425</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence</span>.
