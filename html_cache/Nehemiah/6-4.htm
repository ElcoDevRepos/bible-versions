The number four in biblical terms often signifies completeness or universality, suggesting a thorough attempt to disrupt Nehemiah's mission. This persistence can be seen as a tactic of intimidation and distraction, common in ancient Near Eastern political maneuvers. The repeated message underscores the determination of Nehemiah's enemies to halt the rebuilding efforts, reflecting the broader opposition faced by the Israelites during this period of restoration.<p><b>and each time I gave the same reply</b><br>Nehemiah's consistent response demonstrates his steadfastness and commitment to God's work. His refusal to be swayed by repeated attempts at distraction is a testament to his leadership and faith. This consistency can be seen as a model for spiritual resilience, echoing the biblical theme of standing firm against opposition, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, which encourages believers to stand their ground. Nehemiah's unwavering reply also reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4-5</a>, which advises on how to deal with foolishness and deceit. His actions prefigure the steadfastness of Christ, who remained focused on His mission despite repeated temptations and opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is dedicated to rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

Opposition does not always roar; often it grinds, wearing saints down by sheer repetition.<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows persistent foes: Delilah &#8220;pressed him daily with her words&#8221; until Samson&#8217;s soul was &#8220;annoyed to death&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus faced Satan&#8217;s repeated temptations, yet answered each one with unwavering truth (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul warns that we are not ignorant of Satan&#8217;s schemes (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>), reminding us that spiritual resistance can be a long game.<p>&#8226; Peter calls believers to &#8220;be alert and of sober mind&#8221; because the adversary &#8220;prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>The fourfold approach against Nehemiah underscores how enemies probe for a moment of fatigue; perseverance counters that strategy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They sent me the same message</b><p>Sanballat and Geshem proposed a &#8220;meeting&#8221; in Ono&#8212;far from Jerusalem&#8217;s wall-building (<a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2-3</a>). Their invitation advertised diplomacy but hid danger.<p>&#8226; False unity can disguise sabotage; Paul cautions that &#8220;even Satan masquerades as an angel of light&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist notes enemies who &#8220;speak peace with their neighbors while malice is in their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>).<p>&#8226; For Nehemiah, discernment meant testing motives rather than merely hearing words (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>).<p>Their identical message aimed to lull the governor into thinking nothing sinister lurked beneath repetition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And each time</b><p>Repetition tempted Nehemiah to assume new urgency or legitimacy might have entered the request. Instead, he measured every approach against the same calling God had given.<p>&#8226; Elijah showed similar steadiness when he prayed seven times for rain, never shifting the focus from God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus &#8220;resolutely set out for Jerusalem&#8221; despite continual attempts to redirect Him (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>Continual attacks meet continual watchfulness; unwavering purpose absorbs the shock of recurring pressures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I gave the same reply</b><p>Nehemiah answered consistently: &#8220;I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>).

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ Himself modeled fixed obedience: &#8220;It is written, &#8216;You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-8.htm">Luke 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul stayed laser-focused, refusing distractions that would blunt his race (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p>Practical takeaways:<p>&#8211; Keep the mission in view; clarity silences confusion.<p>&#8211; Answer attacks with truth, not new negotiations.<p>&#8211; Consistency disarms manipulation; the same godly reply gains greater power with every repetition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/6-4.htm">Nehemiah 6:4</a> highlights persistent opposition, deceptive invitations, continual testing, and unwavering resolve. Four cycles of pressure met four identical refusals, proving that steady obedience outweighs relentless scheming. By anchoring to God&#8217;s clear assignment, Nehemiah teaches believers to recognize repetitions of temptation, weigh every invitation against divine purpose, and stand firm with the same faithful reply until the enemy&#8217;s persistence breaks, not ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">times</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6471.htm">Strong's 6471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A beat, foot, anvil, occurrence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
