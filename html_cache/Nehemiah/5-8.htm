The practice of redeeming or buying back individuals is rooted in the Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-47.htm">Leviticus 25:47-49</a>), which provided a means for relatives to redeem family members who had fallen into servitude. This reflects the communal responsibility and solidarity among the Israelites. Historically, during the Babylonian exile, many Jews were taken as captives and sold. Nehemiah's actions demonstrate a commitment to restoring the community and upholding the dignity of his people.<p><b>but now you are selling your own brothers,</b><br>Nehemiah confronts the nobles and officials for exploiting their fellow Jews by selling them into slavery. This internal oppression contradicts the covenantal laws that emphasize justice and compassion among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-11</a>). The selling of fellow Jews into slavery was a violation of the spirit of the law, which sought to protect the vulnerable within the community. This phrase underscores the moral and ethical decline among the leaders, who prioritized personal gain over communal welfare.<p><b>that they may be sold back to us!&#8221;</b><br>Nehemiah points out the absurdity and injustice of the situation, where Jews are being sold and then bought back by their own people. This cycle of exploitation and redemption highlights the systemic issues within the community. It reflects a failure to adhere to the principles of justice and mercy outlined in the Mosaic Law. The situation is reminiscent of the broader biblical theme of redemption, where God redeems His people from bondage, as seen in the Exodus narrative.<p><b>But they remained silent,</b><br>The silence of the nobles and officials indicates their guilt and inability to justify their actions. In biblical narratives, silence often signifies acknowledgment of wrongdoing or the weight of conviction (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4-5</a>). This moment of silence can be seen as a turning point, where the leaders are confronted with the moral implications of their actions and the need for repentance and reform.<p><b>for they could find nothing to say.</b><br>The inability to respond suggests that Nehemiah's rebuke was irrefutable. This phrase emphasizes the power of truth and righteousness in confronting injustice. It also reflects the biblical principle that actions contrary to God's law cannot stand against the truth (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>). The leaders' silence serves as an implicit admission of their failure to uphold the covenantal responsibilities, paving the way for potential restitution and reconciliation within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes and later became the governor of Judah.

This tangible, costly obedience mirrors God&#8217;s heart in <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, where the ransomed of the LORD are gathered home.<p>The phrase underlines sacrificial love that restores dignity to fellow believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were sold to foreigners</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a> had already limited Hebrew servitude; selling brethren to strangers defied that clear law.<p>Nehemiah recalls this shameful history so the nobles cannot plead ignorance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but now you are selling your own brothers</b><p>&#8226;

By profiteering off fellow Jews, the nobles imitate the very nations from whom they were redeemed, reversing God&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17-18</a>).<p>Nehemiah exposes hypocrisy: they boast of covenant status while behaving like oppressors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they may be sold back to us!</b><p>&#8226;

Confronted with undeniable hypocrisy, the leaders fall silent, acknowledging guilt. The verse therefore highlights the call to consistent, sacrificial care for fellow believers, refusing to profit from their hardship and instead reflecting the redeeming character of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Will ye even sell your brethren?</span>--The appeal is a strong one.

"We," here, may be either "we Jews of the captivity," in contrast with "you who have long returned from it," or "we of my house and household" (equivalent to the "I, my brethren, and my servants" of ver. 10), in contrast with "you rich Jews not of my household." Nehemiah must appeal to a well-known fact, that he and others had been in the habit of redeeming enslaved Jews among the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye even sell your brethren?</span> An <span class="accented">argumenturn ad verecundiam.</span> Will ye do the exact opposite? Cause your brethren to be sold into slavery? And not to heathen masters, but to men of their own nation, unto us? Roman creditors, if they sold their debtor slaves, were required by law to sell them across the Tiber - to men of a different race. It was felt to add to the indignity of the slave condition that one should have to serve one's own countryman, recently one's equal and (perhaps) acquaintance. <span class="cmt_word">They held their peace, and found nothing to answer</span>. Or, "found never a word. The argument told. It admitted of no reply. The nobles were ashamed, and had not a word to say. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
