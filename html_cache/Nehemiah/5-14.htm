This appointment highlights the favor Nehemiah found with the king, likely due to his position as cupbearer, a role of significant trust. The land of Judah was a province within the Persian Empire, and Nehemiah's governorship was crucial for the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. This reflects God's providence in using foreign rulers to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other instances like Cyrus's decree in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>.<p><b>from his twentieth year until his thirty-second year (twelve years total)</b><br>The twentieth year of Artaxerxes corresponds to 445 BC, marking the beginning of Nehemiah's governorship. The thirty-second year would be 433 BC. This period was significant for the restoration efforts in Jerusalem, including the rebuilding of the walls and reforms among the people. The twelve-year span indicates a sustained commitment to leadership and reform, paralleling the twelve tribes of Israel and symbolizing completeness in biblical numerology.<p><b>neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor</b><br>Nehemiah's refusal to consume the governor's food allowance demonstrates his integrity and selflessness. This act set a standard for leadership, contrasting with the exploitation by previous governors (<a href="/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>). It reflects the biblical principle of servant leadership, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Nehemiah's actions also align with Paul's teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, where he forgoes his rights for the sake of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah was appointed as the governor of Judah by King Artaxerxes.

Yet he sees that authority as ultimately from God (<a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). His position as &#8220;their governor&#8221; makes him responsible for the welfare of Judah, echoing the shepherd imagery of <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>, where leaders are condemned for feeding themselves instead of the flock.

The point is duration: twelve full years of consistent, sacrificial leadership. Like Paul&#8217;s &#8220;three years&#8221; in Ephesus (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>) or Samuel&#8217;s lifelong service (<a href="/1_samuel/12-1.htm">1 Samuel 12:1-5</a>), Nehemiah&#8217;s record shows sustained faithfulness, not a one-time gesture.
