The returnees from Babylon sought to reestablish their heritage and roles, particularly in the priesthood, which required clear lineage from Aaron. This search reflects the importance of maintaining purity and order in religious service, as seen in <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>, where similar efforts are documented. The emphasis on records underscores the value placed on heritage and the continuity of God's covenant people.<p><b>but they could not find them</b><br>The inability to locate their genealogical records suggests a disruption caused by the Babylonian exile, where many records were lost or destroyed. This loss highlights the challenges faced by the returning exiles in reestablishing their community and religious practices. It also serves as a reminder of the fragility of human efforts to preserve history and identity, contrasting with the eternal nature of God's promises.<p><b>and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean</b><br>Exclusion from the priesthood due to lack of verifiable lineage underscores the strict requirements for serving as a priest, as outlined in Leviticus and Numbers. The term "unclean" here does not imply moral impurity but rather a ritual status that disqualified them from priestly duties. This reflects the holiness required in approaching God, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The exclusion also points to the broader biblical narrative of separation and restoration, foreshadowing the ultimate priesthood of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends these requirements, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah who led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and initiated reforms to restore the community's spiritual and social order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple's sanctity.

Scripture treats lineage for priests with utmost seriousness (cf. <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). By narrowing in on real, named individuals, the text reminds us that God&#8217;s dealings are always personal, never abstract. Every servant in God&#8217;s house must be known and called, just as in <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a> Jesus &#8220;calls His own sheep by name.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>searched for their family records</b><p>The search for written genealogies shows respect for the standards God had already set (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10, 38</a>). These men did not simply assume a right to serve; they investigated.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the Bereans who &#8220;examined the Scriptures daily&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underscores the value God places on orderly documentation (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>).<p>The community&#8217;s willingness to open the archives illustrates accountability. In the same way, believers today are called to &#8220;test everything; hold fast what is good&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they could not find them</b><p>When the records turned up missing, the men did not rely on memory or oral tradition alone. Objective evidence mattered, because priestly service was tied to covenant stipulations (<a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inability to verify lineage highlights human limitation. Like Job, they discovered, &#8220;I am unworthy&#8212;how can I reply to You?&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It shows God&#8217;s providence in protecting worship from casual or unauthorized leadership (cf. <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>Rather than bending the rules out of sentimentality, Israel chose fidelity to God&#8217;s revealed order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean</b><p>&#8220;Excluded&#8221; sounds harsh, yet it was an act of obedience, not rejection. Under the Law, anyone whose status was uncertain was treated as ceremonially unclean until clarity came (<a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm">Leviticus 22:2, 5</a>).<p>&#8226; The governor even commanded them not to eat the most holy things &#8220;until a priest with Urim and Thummim could consult the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a>).<p>&#8226; This temporary exclusion guarded the sanctity of worship and underscored <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>&#8217;s principle that purification is essential to draw near to God.<p>The passage therefore teaches that purity in God&#8217;s service is never optional, and safeguarding it sometimes means waiting on further confirmation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/7-64.htm">Nehemiah 7:64</a> reveals four practical truths: God knows individual servants, He values verifiable accountability, He honors honest limitation, and He insists on purity in ministry. By respecting these boundaries, the restored community protected the holiness of worship and modeled humble submission to Scripture&#8212;an enduring call for every believer who desires to serve the living God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/7-64.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These [men]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">searched for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(biq&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their family records,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
