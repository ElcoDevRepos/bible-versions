Sanballat is identified as a Horonite, likely indicating he was from Horonaim, a city in Moab. Tobiah is described as an Ammonite official, suggesting a position of authority among the Ammonites, a group historically in conflict with Israel. The mention of these figures highlights the political and ethnic tensions surrounding the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. Their opposition is rooted in historical enmity, as both Moabites and Ammonites were descendants of Lot and had longstanding hostilities with Israel (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). This opposition is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, where returning exiles faced resistance from surrounding peoples.<p><b>they were deeply disturbed</b><br>The reaction of Sanballat and Tobiah reflects the threat they perceived to their own power and influence. The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls symbolized a resurgence of Jewish identity and autonomy, which could undermine the control these regional leaders had over the area. Their disturbance is not merely political but also spiritual, as the restoration of Jerusalem was seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to His people. This opposition can be seen as part of the broader spiritual warfare against God's plans, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites</b><br>Nehemiah's mission was not just a construction project but a divine mandate to restore the people of God. The phrase "seek the well-being" indicates a concern for the physical, social, and spiritual restoration of the Israelites. This aligns with the covenantal promises God made to Israel, where their prosperity was tied to their faithfulness to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-10</a>). Nehemiah's role as a type of Christ is evident here, as he acts as a mediator and restorer, foreshadowing Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The well-being of the Israelites is central to God's redemptive plan, as they are the chosen people through whom the Messiah would come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat_the_horonite.htm">Sanballat the Horonite</a></b><br>A prominent adversary of Nehemiah, Sanballat was likely a governor of Samaria. His opposition to Nehemiah's mission reflects the political and social tensions between the returning exiles and the surrounding peoples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tobiah_the_ammonite_official.htm">Tobiah the Ammonite Official</a></b><br>Another key opponent of Nehemiah, Tobiah was an Ammonite leader. His title suggests he held a significant position, possibly as a governor or influential figure in the region. His opposition highlights the historical enmity between the Israelites and the Ammonites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_well-being_of_the_israelites.htm">The Well-being of the Israelites</a></b><br>Nehemiah's mission was to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, which symbolized the restoration and protection of the Jewish community.

Sanballat was from one of the Beth-horons, which had been in Ephraim, and were now in the kingdom of Samaria. His name is seemingly Babylonian, while that of Tobiah is Hebrew. The revival of Jerusalem would be a blow to the recent ascendency of Samaria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sanballat</span>. According to Josephus, Sanballat was "satrap of Samaria" under the Persians, and by descent a Cuthaean ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:7, &sect; 2). He was probably included among the governors to whom Nehemiah had brought letters, and learnt the fact that "a man was come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel" by the delivery of the letters to him.

It has been usual to regard Tobiah as a native chief of the Ammonites, who, after having been a page or other servant at the Persian court, had been made head of the nation. But it seems to be quite as likely that he was a servant of Sanballat's, who stood high in his favour, gave him counsel, and was perhaps his secretary (<a href="/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It grieved them exceedingly</span>. From the time that Zerub-babel rejected the co-operation of the Samaritans in the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>), an enmity set in between the two peoples which continued till the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. The two capitals were too near not to be rivals; and the greater (general) prosperity of Jerusalem made Samaria the bitterer adversary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But when Sanballat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(san&#183;&#7687;al&#183;la&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5571.htm">Strong's 5571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sanballat -- a Samaritan leader</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Horonite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;r&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
