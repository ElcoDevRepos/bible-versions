His presence in the temple signifies a breach of the covenant, as Ammonites were not to enter the assembly of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>). The preparation of a room for him indicates a significant compromise in the spiritual integrity of the temple, reflecting the neglect of the reforms Nehemiah had instituted.<p><b>where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the temple articles,</b><br>These items were essential for the temple's daily operations and worship. Grain offerings were part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing dedication to God (Leviticus 2). Frankincense was used in incense offerings, representing prayers ascending to God (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). The temple articles were sacred objects used in worship, emphasizing the holiness required in approaching God. The displacement of these items for Tobiah's use highlights a severe misappropriation of what was consecrated for divine service.<p><b>and the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers,</b><br>Tithes were a crucial part of the support system for the Levites, who had no inheritance of land and relied on these provisions for sustenance (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). The new wine and oil were also part of the offerings that sustained the temple workers, including singers and gatekeepers, who played vital roles in worship and maintaining the temple's sanctity. The neglect of these provisions indicates a breakdown in the community's commitment to God's commands and the support of those dedicated to His service.<p><b>along with the contributions for the priests.</b><br>The priests were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple's spiritual life. Contributions for the priests were necessary for their livelihood and the continuation of temple worship. The failure to provide these contributions suggests a disregard for the priestly role and the covenantal relationship between God and His people.
