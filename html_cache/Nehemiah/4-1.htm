The rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall was a significant threat to his authority and influence in the region. The wall symbolized the restoration of Jerusalem's strength and independence, which could undermine the power of surrounding regions. Historically, the Samaritans and Jews had a contentious relationship, rooted in religious and cultural differences. The rebuilding effort was led by Nehemiah, who had received permission from King Artaxerxes of Persia, highlighting the divine favor and providence in the Jews' return and restoration efforts.<p><b>he was furious and filled with indignation</b><br>Sanballat's anger reflects the broader opposition faced by the Jews from surrounding peoples who felt threatened by the re-establishment of Jerusalem. His indignation can be seen as a reaction to the perceived challenge to his authority and the potential loss of control over the region. This opposition is a recurring theme in the history of Israel, where God's people often faced hostility from neighboring nations. The emotional response of Sanballat underscores the spiritual battle underlying the physical rebuilding, as the enemy often seeks to thwart God's plans for His people.<p><b>He ridiculed the Jews</b><br>Ridicule was a common tactic used to demoralize and discourage those undertaking God's work. By mocking the Jews, Sanballat aimed to sow doubt and fear among the builders, hoping to halt their progress. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's people faced scorn, such as David facing Goliath's taunts or Jesus enduring mockery during His crucifixion. Ridicule can be a powerful weapon, but the faith and perseverance of the Jews, led by Nehemiah, demonstrate the importance of trusting in God's promises and strength in the face of opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat.htm">Sanballat</a></b><br>A prominent adversary of the Jews during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.
