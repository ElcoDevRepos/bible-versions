Their origins trace back to the Gibeonites, who were made servants to the Levites after deceiving Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). They played a crucial role in maintaining the daily operations of the temple, ensuring that the Levites could focus on their priestly duties. This group highlights the importance of service and support roles within the community of faith.<p><b>lived on the hill of Ophel</b><br>Ophel is a significant geographical location in Jerusalem, situated between the City of David and the Temple Mount. Archaeological findings have confirmed its use during the time of Nehemiah, providing evidence of its strategic importance. Living on Ophel allowed the temple servants to be close to the temple, facilitating their duties. This location underscores the centrality of the temple in the life of Jerusalem and the prioritization of worship and service in the community.<p><b>with Ziha and Gishpa over them</b><br>Ziha and Gishpa were leaders or overseers of the temple servants. Their mention indicates an organized structure within the temple service, ensuring that tasks were managed efficiently. Leadership in the biblical context often involved stewardship and accountability, reflecting the broader biblical principle of order and responsibility in service to God. This structure can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament church's organization, where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined for the edification of the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_servants.htm">Temple Servants (Nethinim)</a></b><br>These were individuals dedicated to assisting the Levites in the service of the temple.
