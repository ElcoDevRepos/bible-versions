The Israelites were to dwell in temporary shelters to remember their ancestors' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus. The "whole assembly" indicates a unified participation, emphasizing the communal aspect of worship and obedience to God's commands. The return from exile marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as they were re-establishing their identity and religious practices after the Babylonian captivity. The act of making booths symbolizes a return to covenant faithfulness and a physical reminder of God's provision and protection.<p><b>From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated like this.</b><br>This statement highlights the rarity and significance of the event. Joshua, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land, represents a time of conquest and settlement. The comparison suggests that the observance of the Feast had not been carried out with such enthusiasm or completeness since those early days. This could imply a period of spiritual neglect or forgetfulness among the Israelites. The revival under Nehemiah and Ezra signifies a renewal of faith and commitment to God's laws. It also underscores the importance of leadership in guiding the people back to proper worship.<p><b>And there was great rejoicing.</b><br>The joy experienced by the Israelites reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and the restoration of their relationship with Him. This rejoicing is not merely emotional but is rooted in obedience and the rediscovery of their spiritual heritage. The celebration serves as a foretaste of the ultimate joy found in God's kingdom, pointing to the eschatological hope of eternal fellowship with God. The communal joy also strengthens the unity of the people, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen nation. This rejoicing can be seen as a type of the joy found in Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, bringing ultimate redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the spiritual revival by reading the Law to the people, helping them understand God's Word.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who had returned from Babylonian exile and were now re-establishing their identity and practices in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/booths.htm">Booths (Sukkot)</a></b><br>Temporary shelters made of branches, commemorating the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_son_of_nun.htm">Joshua son of Nun</a></b><br>The leader who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The Grecised form of Jeshua was "Jesus" (see <a href="/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>). When it is said that since the days of Jeshua <span class="cmt_word">had not the children of Israel done so</span>, we must understand, not that there had been no celebration of the feast of tabernacles since that time - not even that there had been no celebration accompanied by "dwelling in booths," but only that there had been <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">such joyous and general</span> celebration of the festival (comp. what is said in <a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a> of the passover kept in Josiah's eighteenth year). It is the very great gladness that is especially insisted upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">assembly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#257;&#183;h&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
