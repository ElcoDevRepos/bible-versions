The timing is crucial as it occurs amidst external threats and internal challenges. Historically, this period is post-exilic, around the mid-5th century BC, when the Jewish community was re-establishing itself in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>there was a great outcry</b><br>The "great outcry" indicates a significant level of distress and dissatisfaction among the people. This is reminiscent of other biblical instances where the oppressed cry out for justice, such as the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). It highlights the social and economic tensions within the community, which were severe enough to disrupt the rebuilding efforts.<p><b>from the people and their wives</b><br>The mention of "the people and their wives" underscores the widespread nature of the grievance, affecting entire families. In the cultural context, women's involvement in the outcry suggests the severity of the situation, as women typically had less public voice. This inclusion emphasizes the communal impact of the injustices being faced.<p><b>against their fellow Jews</b><br>The conflict is internal, "against their fellow Jews," indicating that the issues were not caused by external enemies but by social injustices within the community. This internal strife contrasts with the external opposition Nehemiah faced from surrounding nations. It reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness within the covenant community, as seen in the prophetic calls for social justice (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes.
