This achievement is a testament to Nehemiah's leadership and the people's dedication, despite opposition from surrounding enemies (<a href="/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3, 6</a>:1-14). The wall's completion symbolizes the restoration of Jerusalem's security and the renewal of the Jewish community's identity and faith.<p><b>in fifty-two days,</b><br>The rapid completion of the wall in just fifty-two days is remarkable, considering the size of Jerusalem and the challenges faced. This swift construction underscores the divine favor and protection over the project, as well as the unity and determination of the people. It reflects the miraculous nature of God's provision and strength, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God enabled His people to achieve great feats (e.g., the crossing of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>).<p><b>on the twenty-fifth of Elul.</b><br>Elul is the sixth month in the Hebrew calendar, typically falling around August-September. The completion of the wall during this time is significant as it precedes the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), a period of reflection and renewal. This timing highlights the spiritual renewal accompanying the physical restoration of the wall. The date also aligns with the agricultural cycle, marking a time of harvest and preparation, symbolizing the fruition of God's promises and the readiness for a new beginning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes.

The very wall that once lay in ruin now stands, finished in a breathtaking fifty-two days, stamped with a clear date for all to verify. Opposition melts, faith is strengthened, and the stage is set for renewed worship. The verse assures believers today that when the Lord directs a work, He brings it to full, timely completion&#8212;often faster and fuller than anyone could imagine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) The finishing of the wall is recorded in the implest manner: first, with a formal specification of the date and time; then in its effect upon the enemies, and as redounding to the glory of God.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">In fifty and two days.</span>--The twenty-fifth day of Elul answers to about our September 15th; and, dating back, the wall began in the latter part of July, soon after Nehemiah's arrival. If we bear in mind that the wall was only partially overthrown, that the materials for restoration were at hand, and that the utmost skill had been shown in organising the bands of workmen, the time will not appear too short. There is no need to adopt the suggestion of Josephus, that the rebuilding occupied two years and four months.<p><span class= "bld">They perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</span>--Not miraculously, but under the Divine sanction and help. By this expression Nehemiah at once triumphs over his foes, and gives the glory where it was due. His own heroic part in the work is utterly forgotten.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days</span>. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:5, &sect; 8), the work of restoration occupied two years and four months, or 840 days, instead of fifty-two. And this period has been thought so much more probable than the smaller one, that moderns generally have accepted it, while some have even proposed to alter our present text of Nehemiah by the insertion of <span class="accented">u-shnathayim</span>, "and two years," at the end of this verse (Ewald). But the authority of Josephus on matters of remote history is so small, and the whole account of Nehemiah is so harmonious and consistent with itself, that alteration seems quite unnecessary. Nehemiah leaves Susa in Nisan, probably towards the middle or close of the month, for his preparations must have taken him some time. He would be likely to be nearly three months on his journey, and would thus reach Jerusalem about the middle of July - say July 15. He then rested three days, surveyed the wall, laid his plan before the nobles, arranged the working parties, and set to work. It was his object to hasten matters as much as possible; and he may well have commenced the rebuilding within ten days of his arrival. Fifty-two days from July 25 would bring him to Sept. 15, which corresponds, as nearly as may be, to the 25th of Elul. There is no difficulty in supposing that the wall could have been repaired in this space. The materials were ready at hand; the working parties were numerous; the workmen full of zeal. If we estimate the circumference of the wall at four miles, which is probably beyond the truth, and the working parties at forty-two (Ewald), it will follow that each party had, on the average, to repair 168 yards, or at the rate of between three and four yards a day. There was probably no work done on the sabbaths, and there may have been one or two days of interruption, when attack seemed imminent (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-15</a>); but otherwise the work was carried on without pause from early dawn to dark (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 21). The wall attained to half its height in a very short time (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 6), - there was then a brief interruption, - after which came the main work of completing the entire circuit to its full height. It is possible that the fifty-two days are counted from the "return to work (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the wall</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2346.htm">Strong's 2346: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall of protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was completed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#353;&#183;lam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in fifty-two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2572.htm">Strong's 2572: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the twenty-fifth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Elul.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">The sixth Jewish month</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">OT History: Nehemiah 6:15 So the wall was finished (Neh Ne) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Nehemiah 6:14"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 6:14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/nehemiah/6-16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Nehemiah 6:16"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 6:16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
