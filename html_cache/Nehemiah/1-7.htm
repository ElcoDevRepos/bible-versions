The term "corruptly" suggests a deviation from God's standards, indicating a deep-seated moral and spiritual decay. This confession is part of Nehemiah's prayer, reflecting the biblical principle of repentance as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>. The acknowledgment of sin is crucial for restoration and aligns with the broader biblical narrative of Israel's repeated cycle of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>and have not kept the commandments, statutes, and ordinances</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the specific areas of disobedience. "Commandments, statutes, and ordinances" refer to the comprehensive body of laws given by God. The commandments are often seen as the moral laws, such as the Ten Commandments. Statutes and ordinances include ceremonial and civil laws. This failure to keep God's law is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, leading to consequences such as exile. It underscores the importance of obedience to God's word, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's adherence to God's laws.<p><b>that You gave Your servant Moses</b><br>This phrase connects the current situation back to the covenant established through Moses. Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, serving as the mediator of the Law. The reference to Moses emphasizes the continuity of God's covenantal relationship with Israel. It also serves as a reminder of the historical and spiritual heritage of the Israelites. The giving of the Law at Sinai (Exodus 19-20) was a foundational moment for Israel, establishing them as God's chosen people with a unique identity and purpose. This connection to Moses also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who fulfills the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is the central figure in the book.
