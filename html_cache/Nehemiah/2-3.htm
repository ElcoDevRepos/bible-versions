In the Persian court, addressing the king required careful etiquette. Nehemiah, a cupbearer, held a trusted position, which allowed him direct access to the king. His reply shows wisdom and courage, as he balances respect with honesty about his concerns.<p><b>&#8220;May the king live forever!</b><br>This phrase is a traditional expression of loyalty and respect in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It reflects Nehemiah's genuine respect for the king and his understanding of court protocol. Similar expressions are found in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4 and 6</a>:21, where subjects address their rulers with honor.<p><b>Why should I not be sad</b><br>Nehemiah's question is rhetorical, emphasizing the depth of his sorrow. His sadness is not just personal but is rooted in a deep sense of identity and responsibility for his people. This emotional response is consistent with the biblical theme of lament over Jerusalem, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/137.htm">Psalm 137:1-6</a>.<p><b>when the city where my fathers are buried</b><br>The mention of his ancestors' burial place highlights the importance of Jerusalem not just as a political center but as a spiritual and cultural heart for the Jewish people. Burial sites were significant in ancient cultures, symbolizing heritage and continuity. This connection to his forefathers underscores the personal and communal loss Nehemiah feels.<p><b>lies in ruins,</b><br>The destruction of Jerusalem had occurred during the Babylonian conquest in 586 BC. The city's ruins were a constant reminder of the judgment and exile that had befallen the Jewish people. Nehemiah's concern reflects the prophetic hope for restoration found in books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, which speak of rebuilding and renewal.<p><b>and its gates have been destroyed by fire?&#8221;</b><br>The gates of a city were crucial for defense and commerce. Their destruction symbolized vulnerability and disgrace. The burning of the gates is specifically mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>, during the Babylonian siege.

We see by this that Nehemiah's family must have belonged to the capital. The Persians, like the Jews, had a great respect for the tomb, and regarded its violation with horror. Artaxerxes would naturally sympathise with the wish of his follower to give security to the city where his ancestors were interred. It would seem that the Persians generally at this time (Herod., 1:140), the kings certainly ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 231, second edition), buried their dead. <span class="cmt_word">Lieth waste</span>. Nehemiah's warmth of feeling exaggerates the fact; but he may have been unconscious of the exaggeration.
