This phrase highlights his leadership and the urgency of the situation. Nehemiah's role is reminiscent of other biblical leaders who guided their people through challenging times, such as Moses and Joshua.<p><b>Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem</b><br>This directive underscores the need for unity and protection. By having everyone stay within the city, Nehemiah ensures that the workforce is readily available and protected from external threats. The mention of servants indicates the social structure of the time, where households often included servants or hired workers. This strategy also reflects the communal living seen in other parts of the Bible, such as the early church in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>.<p><b>so that they can stand guard by night</b><br>The need for vigilance is emphasized here, as the rebuilding efforts faced opposition from surrounding enemies like Sanballat and Tobiah. Standing guard was crucial to prevent sabotage and ensure the safety of the workers. This vigilance is a recurring theme in Scripture, where believers are often called to be watchful, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>.<p><b>and work by day</b><br>The dual focus on guarding and working highlights the balance between defense and progress. This mirrors the Christian life, where believers are called to both protect their faith and actively engage in good works. The dedication to work during the day reflects the industrious spirit encouraged throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, which praises the diligence of the ant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes and later became the governor of Jerusalem.
