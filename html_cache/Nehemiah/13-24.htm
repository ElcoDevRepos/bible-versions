Ashdod was one of the major Philistine cities, and its language would have been distinct from Hebrew. The Philistines were long-time adversaries of Israel, and their presence in the region was a constant source of tension. The fact that Jewish children were speaking the language of Ashdod indicates a significant level of cultural assimilation and a departure from their religious and cultural heritage. This situation reflects the broader issue of intermarriage with foreign peoples, which Nehemiah was addressing. The language barrier also symbolizes a spiritual and cultural divide, as language is a key component of identity and religious practice.<p><b>or of the other peoples</b><br>This phrase suggests that the problem was not limited to Ashdod but included other surrounding nations. The Israelites were surrounded by various peoples, such as the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites, each with their own languages and customs. The influence of these cultures posed a threat to the distinct identity of the Jewish people, which was rooted in their covenant with God. The Torah explicitly warned against adopting the practices of surrounding nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>), emphasizing the importance of maintaining a distinct identity. The presence of multiple foreign languages among the children indicates a widespread issue of cultural and religious compromise.<p><b>but could not speak the language of Judah</b><br>The inability to speak the language of Judah, which was Hebrew, signifies a loss of connection to their heritage and religious traditions. Hebrew was not only the language of daily life but also the language of the Scriptures and worship. This loss would have made it difficult for the children to understand the Law of Moses, participate in religious ceremonies, and fully engage with their community's spiritual life. The language of Judah was a unifying factor for the Jewish people, and its erosion threatened their unity and faithfulness to God. This situation underscores the importance of language in preserving cultural and religious identity, as well as the challenges faced by the Jewish community in maintaining their distinctiveness amidst foreign influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community.

A full fifty percent of the next generation born to mixed marriages (noted earlier in <a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>) were being shaped more by foreign influence than by covenant life in Judah. This reminds us of God&#8217;s warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a> that intermarriage with idol-worshiping nations would &#8220;turn your sons away from following Me&#8221;. Ezra had faced the same crisis a generation earlier (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-2</a>). By highlighting &#8220;half,&#8221; Nehemiah shows how quickly faith can erode when homes are divided in spiritual allegiance (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>spoke the language of Ashdod</b><p>Ashdod was a leading Philistine city (<a href="/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>). Its language&#8212;and culture&#8212;carried the memory of Dagon worship (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a>). When children &#8220;spoke the language of Ashdod,&#8221; they were absorbing the worldview that came with that tongue. Language shapes thinking, loyalties, and worship. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> commands parents to impress God&#8217;s words on their children &#8220;when you sit at home and when you walk along the road&#8221;. These families had instead allowed a rival vocabulary to fill daily conversation, dulling their children&#8217;s ears to the voice of the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or of the other peoples</b><p>Nehemiah broadens the concern: some kids spoke &#8220;the language&#8230;of the other peoples.&#8221; Earlier verses mention Ammonite and Moabite marriages (<a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>). Those nations historically opposed Israel (<a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1-6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-8</a>). The children&#8217;s speech revealed divided roots, echoing Israel&#8217;s compromise under Ahab when Baal&#8217;s prophets flourished (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). It also fulfils the pattern warned in <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>&#8212;foreign alliances lead to shared feasts, shared gods, and, eventually, shared language.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but could not speak the language of Judah</b><p>Tragically, these children &#8220;could not speak the language of Judah,&#8221; the tongue in which God&#8217;s Law, worship songs, and covenant history were recorded. Without it, they could not:<p>&#8226; understand public reading of Scripture (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>)<p>&#8226; sing Psalms of Zion (<a href="/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a>)<p>&#8226; participate fully in temple life (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14-18</a>)<p>Failure to speak Judah&#8217;s language meant a break in identity and mission. <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a> urges training a child &#8220;in the way he should go,&#8221; yet these parents had forfeited that calling. Nehemiah reacts by contending with them (<a href="/nehemiah/13-25.htm">Nehemiah 13:25-27</a>), echoing Paul&#8217;s later warning that &#8220;bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/13-24.htm">Nehemiah 13:24</a> exposes how mixed marriages produced a generation fluent in foreign speech but illiterate in the language of God&#8217;s people. Half the children mirrored Ashdod and neighboring nations, signaling a drift from covenant truth. Language here represents allegiance: when Judah&#8217;s tongue is lost, so is Judah&#8217;s heart. The verse therefore calls every believing home to guard the spiritual and cultural nurture of their children, ensuring that God&#8217;s words remain their first and most familiar language.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Half in the speech of</span> <span class= "bld">Ashdod.</span>--A mixture of Philistine and Aramaic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod</span>.
