This reflects a common practice in ancient Near Eastern governance, where local rulers often extracted resources to maintain their own status and fulfill obligations to the empire. The burden on the people would have included both financial and labor demands, contributing to social and economic distress. This context highlights the contrast between Nehemiah's leadership and that of his predecessors.<p><b>taking from them bread and wine plus forty shekels of silver</b><br>The specific mention of bread, wine, and silver indicates the types of tributes or taxes that were common. Bread and wine were staples of the diet, essential for daily sustenance, while silver was a valuable currency. The forty shekels of silver represent a significant financial burden, as a shekel was a standard unit of weight and currency in the ancient world. This practice of taking essential goods and money would have exacerbated the poverty and hardship among the people.<p><b>Their servants also oppressed the people</b><br>The servants of the governors, likely officials or enforcers, contributed to the oppression. This suggests a systemic issue where not only the leaders but also their subordinates exploited their positions for personal gain. This reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament of unjust leadership and the exploitation of the vulnerable, as seen in other prophetic critiques of social injustice (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>, <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>).<p><b>But I did not do this</b><br>Nehemiah distinguishes his leadership by refusing to exploit the people. His decision not to impose the same burdens demonstrates a commitment to justice and compassion. This aligns with biblical principles of righteous leadership, as seen in the examples of leaders like Moses and David, who prioritized the well-being of their people.<p><b>because of my fear of God</b><br>Nehemiah's motivation is rooted in his reverence for God, which guides his ethical and moral decisions. The fear of God, a recurring biblical theme, denotes a deep respect and awe for God's authority and commandments. This fear leads to wisdom and righteous living, as emphasized in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>. Nehemiah's actions reflect a desire to honor God above personal or political gain, aligning with the biblical call to love one's neighbor and act justly (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes and later became the governor of Judah.

The word &#8220;burdened&#8221; is literal: food, money, labor, even dignity were demanded. Compare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a>&#8212;Samuel warns that rulers will &#8220;take your sons and daughters&#8230; your fields&#8230; a tenth of your grain.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>&#8212;Egypt set &#8220;taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;When the wicked rule, the people groan.&#8221;<p>Those prior governors treated authority as entitlement, not stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Taking from them bread and wine plus forty shekels of silver</b><p>Nehemiah specifies the toll: daily provisions and a sizable silver levy (roughly a worker&#8217;s annual wage). This shows:<p>&#8226; Exploitation was routine&#8212;basic food (bread and wine) became taxable luxury. See <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-8</a> where the poor are &#8220;sold for a pair of sandals.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Money grabs were systematic&#8212;<a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a> tells of Jehoiakim taxing &#8220;silver and gold&#8230; from the people of the land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God detests such &#8220;unequal measures&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9-12</a>). Oppression wasn&#8217;t ignorance; it was intentional policy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their servants also oppressed the people</b><p>Corrupt leaders breed corrupt subordinates. When the boss is greedy, the staff feels licensed to gouge even harder. Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>&#8212;Eli&#8217;s sons, temple servants, seized the best meat.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/18-28.htm">Matthew 18:28</a>&#8212;A servant forgiven much throttles a peer over pocket change.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.&#8221;<p>The rot trickles down, multiplying misery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I did not do this</b><p>Nehemiah draws a bold contrast. He held the same title, but chose a different path.

Prior leaders exploited the people through heavy taxes, daily requisitions, and corrupt aides. Nehemiah, gripped by reverence for the Lord, rejected those practices, bore the costs himself, and modeled servant leadership. The verse reminds us that godly fear curbs greed, safeguards the vulnerable, and turns authority into ministry rather than mastery.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Besides forty shekels of silver.</span>--Either <span class= "ital">in bread and wine over forty shekels,</span> or, <span class= "ital">received in</span> <span class= "ital">bread and wine, and beyond that, forty shekels.</span> The latter, on the whole, is to be preferred; it would amount to about four pounds from the entire people daily.<p><span class= "bld">So did not I, because of the tear of God.</span>--Nehemiah contrasts his forbearance with the conduct of former governors; we cannot suppose him to mean Zorubbabel, but some of his successors.

The words of the original are stronger, and should be rendered "had <span class="accented">oppressed</span> the people (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.), "had been heavy upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels</span>. Rather, "had taken from them, <span class="accented">for</span> bread and wine, <span class="accented">above</span> forty shekels." (So Ewald and Bertheau.) Forty shekels <span class="accented">a day</span> from the whole people would seem to be intended - not forty shekels a year from each person, as some explain. <span class="cmt_word">Even their servants bare rule</span>. The oppression exercised by the domestics and other hangers-on of rulers is often worse than their own. This is especially the case in the East, where eunuchs and other domestics have been the most fearful tyrants. Haman under Xerxes, Sejanus under Tiberius, Narcissus under Nero, are examples. <span class="cmt_word">So did not I.</span> I neither exacted money, nor allowed my servants to bear rule. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the fear of God</span>. Because I felt that it would be wrong, either absolutely or under the circumstances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The governors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hap&#183;pa&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
