Their role was crucial in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel, as they were responsible for teaching the Law and leading worship.

Eliashib was a contemporary of Nehemiah and played a role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. The mention of Johanan indicates a specific historical period, likely around the late 5th century BC.

This record-keeping was essential for maintaining genealogies and ensuring the proper succession of priestly duties. It reflects the importance of documentation in preserving the identity and religious practices of the Jewish people.
