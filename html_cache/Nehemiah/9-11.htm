This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and power. The division of the sea is a demonstration of God's sovereignty over creation, fulfilling His promise to deliver Israel from Egyptian bondage. The act of dividing the sea is also a type of baptism, as mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, where Paul describes the Israelites' passage through the sea as a form of baptism into Moses, prefiguring Christian baptism into Christ.<p><b>and they crossed through it on dry ground</b><br>The crossing on dry ground emphasizes the completeness of God's miracle, ensuring the safety and ease of passage for the Israelites. This detail underscores God's provision and care, contrasting with the natural impossibility of such an event. The dry ground signifies a path made by God, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>, where God is described as making a way through the sea. This miraculous provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and His ability to make a way where there seems to be none.<p><b>You hurled their pursuers into the depths</b><br>This phrase highlights God's judgment against the Egyptians, who pursued the Israelites with the intent to enslave them again. The "depths" refer to the waters of the Red Sea returning to their place, as described in <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>. This act of divine retribution serves as a warning against opposing God's purposes and people. It also fulfills God's promise to fight for Israel, as stated in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, and demonstrates His role as a divine warrior who protects His covenant people.<p><b>like a stone into raging waters</b><br>The imagery of a stone sinking into raging waters conveys the sudden and complete destruction of the Egyptian forces. This simile emphasizes the powerlessness of the Egyptians against God's might. The "raging waters" symbolize chaos and judgment, often associated with God's wrath in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14-15</a>. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of all God's enemies, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where evil is cast into the lake of fire. The phrase serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the futility of resisting His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and faithfulness by delivering the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who experienced His miraculous deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The pursuers of the Israelites, who were defeated by God as He closed the sea over them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites during the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, who is recounting God's past faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all creation, including the natural elements.
