This decision underscores the importance of leadership by example, as the leaders' presence in the city would encourage others to follow. Jerusalem, being the political and spiritual center of Israel, required strong leadership to ensure its restoration and protection. The leaders' settlement in Jerusalem also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to reestablish His people in the city, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a>.<p><b>and the rest of the people cast lots</b><br>Casting lots was a common biblical practice used to discern God's will in decision-making (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). It ensured fairness and divine guidance in choosing who would relocate to Jerusalem. This method reflects the Israelites' reliance on God's sovereignty and providence in their communal life. The use of lots can be seen in other biblical contexts, such as the division of the Promised Land among the tribes (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>).<p><b>to bring one out of ten to live in the holy city of Jerusalem</b><br>The decision to bring one out of ten people to live in Jerusalem indicates a tithe-like approach, symbolizing dedication and sacrifice for the sake of the community and the city. Jerusalem is referred to as the "holy city," emphasizing its significance as the center of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence (<a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>). This relocation was crucial for the city's repopulation and revitalization, ensuring that it remained a vibrant and secure hub for the nation.<p><b>while the remaining nine were to dwell in their own towns</b><br>The majority of the people continued to live in their own towns, maintaining the agricultural and economic stability of the surrounding regions. This balance between urban and rural life was essential for the overall well-being of the nation. The arrangement allowed for the support of Jerusalem's inhabitants while preserving the cultural and familial ties of those in the countryside. This distribution reflects the broader biblical theme of community and interdependence among God's people, as seen in the early church's sharing of resources (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_the_people.htm">Leaders of the People</a></b><br>These were the heads or chiefs among the Israelites who took the initiative to settle in Jerusalem, demonstrating leadership and commitment to the restoration of the city.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>Known as the "holy city," Jerusalem was central to Jewish identity and worship.

The Jews had frequent recourse to the lot for the determining of doubtful matters, believing, as they did, that "the whole disposing thereof was of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Divine sanction had been given, in the course of the Jewish history, to the use of the lot for the selection of persons (Joshua 7:16-18 <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19-21</a>), for the distribution of lands (<a href="/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25, 26</a>), and for the determination of the order in which different bodies should execute an office (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>). In the democratic states of Greece it was used widely to determine between candidates for an office. One in ten. Ewald supposes that this was to be the proportion between the population of Jerusalem and the whole population of the country, and ascribes the fixing of the proportion to Zerubbabel ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 159). But there is no statement to this effect in either Ezra or Nehemiah, and the brief narrative of this verse seems to imply the addition of a tenth part of the country population to the previous population of Jerusalem, rather than the establishment of any definite proportion between the two.
