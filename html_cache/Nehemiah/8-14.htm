The Law refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were foundational for Jewish religious and social life. This rediscovery often led to spiritual renewal, as seen in other biblical instances such as King Josiah's reforms (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>).<p><b>which the LORD had commanded through Moses</b><br>This emphasizes the divine origin of the Law, underscoring its authority and the role of Moses as the mediator between God and Israel. The phrase reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God gave the Law to Moses (Exodus 19-24). It also points to the continuity of God's commands and their relevance across generations.<p><b>that the Israelites were to dwell in booths</b><br>This refers to the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), a festival commanded in <a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>. The booths, or temporary shelters, symbolize the Israelites' dependence on God during their wilderness journey after the Exodus. This practice served as a tangible reminder of God's provision and protection.<p><b>during the feast of the seventh month</b><br>The seventh month, Tishri, is significant in the Jewish calendar, hosting several important festivals, including the Feast of Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), and the Feast of Tabernacles. This period is a time of reflection, repentance, and celebration of God's faithfulness.
