The storerooms were crucial for storing tithes, offerings, and supplies necessary for temple worship and the sustenance of the Levites.

The mention of his ancestry suggests a legacy of faithfulness and service, which was vital for maintaining trust and integrity in temple duties.<p><b>because they were considered trustworthy</b><br>Trustworthiness was a critical criterion for those handling temple resources. This reflects the biblical principle that those who are faithful in small things will be entrusted with greater responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). The integrity of these men ensured the proper distribution and use of offerings dedicated to God.<p><b>They were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites</b><br>The distribution of supplies was essential for the sustenance of the Levites, who had no inheritance of land and relied on the tithes and offerings for their livelihood (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>).

Earlier, he had done the same with Hanani and Hananiah because &#8220;he was a faithful man who feared God more than many&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a>). The storerooms had been misused (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4-9</a>), so direct, accountable appointments were crucial. Just as Paul later remarks that &#8220;it is required of stewards that one be found faithful&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>), Nehemiah ensures stewardship is in trustworthy hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shelemiah the priest</b><p>Including a priest guarantees spiritual integrity in handling holy tithes (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-9</a>). Priests were charged to &#8220;preserve knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;instruct many&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>), so appointing Shelemiah binds the work to both ritual purity and doctrinal fidelity. His presence reminds the people that every practical task in God&#8217;s house has a sacred dimension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zadok the scribe</b><p>A scribe brought meticulous record-keeping to the team. Like Ezra who &#8220;had set his heart to study the Law&#8230;and to teach&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>), Zadok safeguards accuracy and transparency. In a reform movement where offerings had been neglected (<a href="/nehemiah/10-32.htm">Nehemiah 10:32-39</a>), written accountability protects both giver and recipient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pedaiah of the Levites</b><p>Levites were supported by the tithes (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>), so a Levite overseeing the storerooms embodies fairness: those who live from the offerings help manage them. Pedaiah&#8217;s inclusion also models service over status, echoing Jesus&#8217; later words that &#8220;whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah</b><p>Hanan rounds out the group, illustrating plurality of leadership. David once appointed Levites &#8220;to minister before the ark&#8230;to give thanks and to praise&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4</a>). Likewise, Hanan&#8217;s addition shares the load and widens accountability, preventing any single individual from monopolizing authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to assist them</b><p>The phrase highlights teamwork. As Ecclesiastes notes, &#8220;Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>). The body of Christ later operates on the same principle&#8212;&#8220;God arranged the members&#8230;as He desired&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Mutual support limits burnout and guards against corruption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they were considered trustworthy</b><p>Character, not charisma, qualifies God&#8217;s servants. Proverbs affirms, &#8220;A faithful man will abound with blessings&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a>), and Jesus teaches, &#8220;He who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). Nehemiah selects men whose track records prove reliability. <a href="/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a> applies the same criterion to elders: they must be &#8220;blameless as God&#8217;s stewards.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites</b><p>The goal is equitable distribution, not hoarding. <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-3</a> mirrors this when seven men oversee daily food for widows so the apostles can focus on prayer and the word. Paul similarly ensures that gifts for Jerusalem are handled &#8220;in the sight of the Lord and of men&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19-21</a>). Proper distribution nurtures unity and sustains worship in the Temple, enabling Levites to devote themselves to their God-given duties.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Nehemiah 13:13</a> shows practical holiness in action. After clearing misuse of God&#8217;s house, Nehemiah appoints a balanced, trustworthy team&#8212;priest, scribe, Levites&#8212;who cooperate to guard and distribute the people&#8217;s offerings. Their integrity protects worship, supports ministry, and models the timeless principle that faithful stewardship under accountable leadership honors God and blesses His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And I made.</span>--The reform was made effectual by organisation. Eliashib had failed in his duty (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:">Nehemiah 13:4</a>); and the appointment of treasurers (<a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm" title="And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.">Nehemiah 12:44</a>) is now confirmed. One of the treasurers was a layman named Hanan (<a href="/nehemiah/10-22.htm" title="Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,">Nehemiah 10:22</a>); but they were all faithful men, and are mentioned in connection with the building of the wall. The majority being priests and Levites, they distributed "to their brethren." Zadok was probably the Zidkijah of <a href="/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, and the secretary of Nehemiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I made treasurers</span>. It was perhaps now for the first time that special treasurers were provided to have the charge of the temple store-chambers, these having hitherto been under the superintendence of the high priest (ver. 4). The appointment mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a> is probably the same with this; and the entire duty of the treasurers is to be learnt by combining that passage with the present. They were to be both the collectors and the dispensers of the tithes. Of the four treasurers, one was a priest, one a Levite, one a layman of rank (see <a href="/nehemiah/10-22.htm">Nehemiah 10:22</a>), and one a professional scribe. This last, <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>, is perhaps to be identified with the "Zidkijah" of <a href="/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, who appears to have been Nehemiah's private secretary (see the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their brethren</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the priests and Levites, brethren of Shelemiah and Pedaiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I appointed as treasurers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7779;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
