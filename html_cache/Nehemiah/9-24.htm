The "descendants" are the Israelites who, under the leadership of Joshua, entered and took possession of the Promised Land after the Exodus from Egypt. This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in a land of their own. The possession of the land is a testament to God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant promises.<p><b>You subdued before them the Canaanites dwelling in the land.</b><br>The subjugation of the Canaanites was a divine act, demonstrating God's sovereignty and power. The Canaanites were the original inhabitants of the land, known for their idolatrous practices and moral corruption (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). God's command to subdue them was both a judgment against their wickedness and a means to protect Israel from spiritual contamination. Archaeological evidence, such as the destruction layers found in cities like Jericho and Hazor, supports the biblical account of the conquest. This subjugation also prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil.<p><b>You delivered into their hands the kings and peoples of the land,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's active role in granting Israel victory over the Canaanite kings and their people. The book of Joshua details numerous battles where God intervened on behalf of Israel, such as the miraculous fall of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the sun standing still at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>). These victories were not due to Israel's military prowess but were acts of divine intervention. The deliverance of these kings and peoples into Israel's hands is a reminder of God's omnipotence and His commitment to His covenant people.<p><b>to do with them as they wished.</b><br>This phrase indicates the complete control and authority that God granted Israel over the conquered peoples. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of the victor determining the fate of the vanquished, often involving subjugation or destruction. In the biblical context, this authority was meant to ensure the purity of Israel's worship and adherence to God's laws, preventing the influence of Canaanite idolatry. This concept of divine judgment and authority foreshadows the ultimate judgment and reign of Christ, who will establish His kingdom in righteousness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_israel.htm">Descendants of Israel</a></b><br>The Israelites, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were led by God to possess the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land of Canaan, whom God subdued before the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, representing God's promise and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_peoples_of_the_land.htm">Kings and Peoples of the Land</a></b><br>The various rulers and inhabitants of Canaan who were delivered into the hands of the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_intervention.htm">God's Intervention</a></b><br>The divine act of subduing the Canaanites and delivering them into the hands of the Israelites, demonstrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God fulfills His promises, as seen in the Israelites' possession of the land.
