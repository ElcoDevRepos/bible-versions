The "evening shadows" indicate the approach of the Sabbath, which begins at sundown on Friday. The gates of Jerusalem were crucial for trade and security, and their closing signified the transition from the workweek to the sacred rest of the Sabbath. This practice aligns with the Jewish tradition of preparing for the Sabbath as outlined in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, emphasizing rest and holiness.<p><b>just before the Sabbath</b><br>The timing here is critical, as it underscores the importance of the Sabbath in Jewish life. The Sabbath is a day of rest commanded by God in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>) and is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). Nehemiah's actions reflect a commitment to uphold the sanctity of the Sabbath, which had been neglected during the exile. This observance is a reminder of God's creation rest (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and a foreshadowing of the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>I ordered that the gates be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath</b><br>Nehemiah's directive to shut the gates demonstrates his leadership and determination to enforce the law. This action was necessary to prevent commerce and ensure the Sabbath was kept holy, as trading on the Sabbath was a violation of the law (<a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>). Nehemiah's reform efforts were part of a broader movement to restore religious practices after the return from Babylonian exile. His leadership parallels that of Moses, who also enforced God's laws among the Israelites.<p><b>I posted some of my servants at the gates</b><br>By stationing his servants at the gates, Nehemiah ensured compliance with his orders. This measure reflects the practical steps taken to uphold religious observance and prevent the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The use of servants indicates the seriousness of the situation and Nehemiah's personal investment in the spiritual welfare of the people. This act of vigilance is reminiscent of the watchmen in <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6-7</a>, who are tasked with maintaining the city's spiritual integrity.<p><b>so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day</b><br>Preventing loads from entering the city on the Sabbath was crucial to maintaining its sanctity. The prohibition of work on the Sabbath is rooted in the creation narrative and the covenantal law given to Israel. This restriction highlights the importance of rest and worship, setting the Israelites apart from other nations. Nehemiah's enforcement of this law serves as a type of Christ, who fulfills the law and offers spiritual rest to believers (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader and governor of Jerusalem who led the rebuilding of the city's walls and instituted religious reforms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city of the Jewish people, where Nehemiah was working to restore both physical and spiritual order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The day of rest and worship, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, as commanded in the Mosaic Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates_of_jerusalem.htm">Gates of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The entry points to the city, which Nehemiah ordered to be closed to prevent commerce on the Sabbath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah's_men.htm">Nehemiah's Men</a></b><br>The individuals Nehemiah stationed at the gates to enforce the Sabbath observance by preventing trade.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_observance.htm">Sabbath Observance</a></b><br>Nehemiah's actions underscore the importance of setting aside time for rest and worship, as commanded by God.
