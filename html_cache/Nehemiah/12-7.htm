Each name is significant in the context of the restoration of Jerusalem and the reestablishment of temple worship. Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah are listed among the priests, indicating their role in maintaining the spiritual life of the community. The mention of these names underscores the continuity of the priestly line, which was crucial for the legitimacy of temple services. The priestly lineage is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the purity and order of worship as prescribed in the Law of Moses.<p><b>These were the leaders of the priests and their associates</b><br>The term "leaders" highlights their authority and responsibility in guiding the religious practices of the people. The priests were not only responsible for performing sacrifices but also for teaching the Law and leading the community in worship. Their associates likely included Levites and other temple workers who assisted in various duties. This structure reflects the organized nature of temple service, which was essential for the spiritual health of the nation. The leadership of the priests is a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament, pointing to the need for spiritual guidance and oversight.<p><b>in the days of Jeshua.</b><br>Jeshua, also known as Joshua, was the high priest during the time of Zerubbabel, who led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem. His leadership was pivotal in the rebuilding of the temple and the reestablishment of worship. The phrase "in the days of Jeshua" situates this passage in a specific historical context, during the early post-exilic period. This was a time of renewal and rebuilding, both physically and spiritually, for the Jewish people. Jeshua's role as high priest is significant, as he is seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest who would come to restore and redeem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sallu.htm">Sallu</a></b><br>A priestly leader mentioned in the context of the return from Babylonian exile.
