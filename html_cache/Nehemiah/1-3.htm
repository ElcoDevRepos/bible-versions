It sets the stage for Nehemiah's response and subsequent actions. The use of "they" indicates a group of people, possibly fellow Jews who had returned from Jerusalem, emphasizing the communal nature of the Jewish people during the exile.<p><b>The remnant who survived the exile</b><br>The term "remnant" refers to the small group of Jews who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. This concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing God's faithfulness in preserving a portion of His people despite judgment. The exile was a pivotal event in Jewish history, marking a period of punishment and purification, as prophesied in books like Jeremiah and Isaiah.<p><b>are there in the province</b><br>The "province" refers to the region of Judah, which was under Persian control at the time. This highlights the geopolitical situation of the Jews, who were living under foreign rule. The term underscores the diminished status of Judah, no longer an independent kingdom but a mere province within the vast Persian Empire.<p><b>in great trouble and disgrace</b><br>This phrase describes the dire situation of the Jewish remnant. "Great trouble" suggests severe hardship, while "disgrace" indicates a loss of honor and respect. This reflects the social and spiritual condition of the people, who were struggling to reestablish their identity and faith amidst external and internal challenges. The disgrace could also be seen as a consequence of their past disobedience to God.<p><b>The wall of Jerusalem is broken down</b><br>The broken wall symbolizes vulnerability and defenselessness. In ancient times, city walls were crucial for protection against enemies. The destruction of Jerusalem's wall, initially by the Babylonians, left the city exposed to further attacks and symbolized the broken state of the nation. This physical ruin also represents spiritual decay, as walls often symbolize separation from sin and protection by God.<p><b>and its gates have been burned with fire</b><br>Burned gates signify complete destruction and loss of security. Gates were not only entry points but also places of commerce and justice. Their destruction indicates a breakdown of social order and governance. The burning of the gates is a vivid image of devastation, echoing the prophecies of judgment found in books like Lamentations and Ezekiel. This destruction sets the stage for Nehemiah's mission to rebuild, which can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work in restoring what is broken.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is deeply concerned about the welfare of Jerusalem and its people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>The Jewish people who survived the Babylonian exile and returned to Jerusalem.

All these expressions are familiar in the prophets; but they are united here in a peculiar and affecting combination. As to the city, the report is that the walls were still "broken down": lying prostrate, with partial exceptions, as Nebuchadnezzar left them a hundred and forty-two years before (<a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.">2Kings 25:10</a>), and, moreover, what had not been recorded, "the gates thereof burned with fire." Though the Temple had been rebuilt, there is no valid reason for supposing that. the walls of the city had been in part restored and again demolished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down</span>. It has been supposed, either that the demolition of the wall here referred to was quite recent, having occurred during the space of twelve years which intervenes between the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, or else that it belonged to a time of depression which followed shortly after the completion of the temple by Zerubbabel (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. pp. 120, 121, and 148, note 3, E. Tr.); but there is really no reason to believe that the demolition effected under the orders of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>) had ever hitherto been repaired, or the restoration of the wall even attempted. The Samaritan accusation in <a href="/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12</a> falls short of a statement that the wall was restored, and, if it asserted the fact, would be insufficient authority for it. The supposition of Ewald, that "as soon as the city was rebuilt, the attempt <span class="accented">would be made</span> to fortify it" (p. 121, note 3), ignores the jealousy of the Persians and their power to step in and prevent a subject town from fortifying itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
