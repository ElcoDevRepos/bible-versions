Asaph's role as the keeper of the king's forest suggests a position of significant responsibility, overseeing resources vital for construction and royal projects. This forest, likely located in Lebanon, was renowned for its quality timber, used in significant building projects, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The request highlights the necessity of securing materials for rebuilding efforts and the strategic planning involved in Nehemiah's mission.<p><b>so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel to the temple,</b><br>The timber was intended for structural purposes, emphasizing the need for strong materials to ensure the durability of the gates. The citadel refers to a fortified area near the temple, crucial for the protection of Jerusalem. This request underscores the importance of security and defense in the restoration of the city. The temple's proximity to the citadel highlights its central role in the spiritual and communal life of the Jewish people, reflecting the priority of worship and religious observance in Nehemiah's plans.<p><b>for the city wall,</b><br>Rebuilding the city wall was essential for the protection and identity of Jerusalem. Walls in ancient cities symbolized strength and security, and their restoration was vital for the city's defense against enemies. The wall's reconstruction also represented a renewal of the community's social and religious life, as it allowed the inhabitants to live without fear of external threats. This effort fulfilled prophecies of restoration and renewal, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>, where the rebuilding of ancient ruins is promised.<p><b>and for the house I will occupy.&#8221;</b><br>Nehemiah's request for timber for his own house indicates the practical needs of leadership. As governor, he required a residence that would serve as a base for his administrative duties. This personal provision also reflects the broader theme of restoration, as Nehemiah's leadership was crucial for the successful rebuilding of Jerusalem. His house would symbolize stability and governance, essential for the community's reestablishment.<p><b>And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me,</b><br>Nehemiah attributes his success to divine favor, recognizing God's sovereignty and providence in the unfolding events. This acknowledgment of God's hand reflects a recurring biblical theme where God's intervention is seen in the lives of His people (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 9</a>). It underscores the belief that human efforts are ultimately dependent on divine blessing and guidance, a principle that encourages faith and reliance on God.<p><b>the king granted my requests.</b><br>The king's approval of Nehemiah's requests demonstrates the influence of God's favor in the hearts of rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). This outcome highlights the interplay between divine providence and human authority, where God uses earthly powers to accomplish His purposes. The king's support was crucial for the success of Nehemiah's mission, illustrating how God can work through secular authorities to fulfill His plans for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia, who is deeply concerned about the welfare of Jerusalem and its people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who grants Nehemiah's request to return to Jerusalem to rebuild its walls.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The keeper of the king&#8217;s forest, responsible for providing the timber needed for Nehemiah&#8217;s construction projects.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_forest.htm">The King&#8217;s Forest</a></b><br>A royal resource managed by Asaph, providing essential materials for the rebuilding efforts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city whose walls Nehemiah is determined to rebuild, symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community and their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor_and_human_initiative.htm">Divine Favor and Human Initiative</a></b><br>Nehemiah&#8217;s success was due to both his initiative and God&#8217;s favor.

Standing before Artaxerxes, Nehemiah asks for written authorization&#8212;an official royal letter&#8212;to Asaph, the overseer of the imperial forest.<p>&#8226; This is not mere formality; in Persia, a written decree carried the full weight of the king (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah models the balance of spiritual dependence and earthly prudence.

It was well planted with trees, as timber was to be supplied from it "for the gates of the palace," rather the <span class= "ital">fortress,</span> which protected "the house," or temple, and was known in Roman times as Antonia; also for the city walls; also "for the house that I shall enter into," that is, Nehemiah's own house, for his being appointed governor is pre-supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's forest</span>. Patrick supposes the forest on Mount Lebanon to be intended; but Nehemiah would scarcely have desired to transport timber for ordinary building purposes from such a distance. Moreover, the word used is one not applicable to a natural forest, but only to a park, or pleasure-ground planted with trees, and surrounded by a fence or wall. The word is <span class="accented">pardes</span>, the Hebrew representative of that Persian term which the Greeks rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whence our "paradise." We must understand a royal park in the vicinity of Jerusalem, of which a Jew, Asaph, was the keeper. <span class="cmt_word">The palace which appertained to the house</span>. The "house" here spoken of is undoubtedly the temple; and the <span class="accented">birah</span>, appertaining to it is, almost certainly, the fortress at the north-west angle of the temple area, which at once commanded and protected it. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:11, &sect; 4) that this fortress was called <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> originally. In Roman times it was known as the "Turris Antonia." <span class="cmt_word">The house that I shall enter into</span>. The governor's residence. Nehemiah assumes that the powers for which he asks involve his being appointed governor of Judaea. The king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. Through God's special favour towards me, the king was induced to grant my request. <p> CHAPTER 2:9-11 NEHEMIAH'S JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM (<a href="/nehemiah/3-9.htm">Nehemiah 3:9-11</a>). On his way to Jerusalem, Nehemiah would pass through the provinces of various Persian satraps and governors. To those beyond the Euphrates he carried letters, which he took care to deliver, though by doing so he aroused the hostility of San-ballat. Being accompanied by an escort of Persian soldiers, he experienced neither difficulty nor danger by the way, but effected his journey in about three months. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And may I have a letter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1441;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ig&#183;ge&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
