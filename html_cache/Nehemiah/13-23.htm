Nehemiah had been appointed as governor of Judah by the Persian king Artaxerxes and had led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. His return marks a time of reform and renewal for the Jewish community.<p><b>I also saw Jews</b><br>Nehemiah, as a leader and reformer, was observant of the community's practices. The term "Jews" here refers to the people of Judah, who were expected to adhere to the laws given to them by God through Moses. Nehemiah's role was to ensure that these laws were being followed.<p><b>who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab</b><br>Intermarriage with foreign nations was a significant issue because it often led to the introduction of foreign gods and practices, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). Ashdod was a Philistine city, while Ammon and Moab were neighboring nations often in conflict with Israel. These marriages threatened the religious purity and cultural identity of the Jewish people. Historically, these nations had been adversaries of Israel, and their influence was seen as a potential source of spiritual corruption. This situation echoes the earlier reforms of Ezra, who also dealt with the issue of intermarriage (Ezra 9-10). The concern was not ethnic but religious, as these unions could lead to idolatry and a departure from the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who served as the governor of Jerusalem.
