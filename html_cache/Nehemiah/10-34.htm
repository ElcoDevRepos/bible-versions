In this context, it was a method to ensure fairness and divine guidance in assigning responsibilities. The involvement of priests, Levites, and people highlights the communal nature of the task, emphasizing unity and shared responsibility in worship practices. This practice can be seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the division of the land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>).<p><b>for the donation of wood by our families</b><br>The donation of wood was essential for maintaining the altar's fire, as prescribed in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>). Each family&#8217;s contribution ensured a continuous supply, reflecting the communal effort in sustaining worship. This practice underscores the importance of each family&#8217;s role in supporting temple services, symbolizing the collective dedication to God&#8217;s commandments.<p><b>at the appointed times each year</b><br>The phrase indicates a structured and recurring obligation, suggesting a well-organized system for temple maintenance. This regularity ensured that the temple's needs were met consistently, reflecting the Israelites' commitment to their covenant with God. The concept of appointed times is also seen in the observance of feasts and Sabbaths (Leviticus 23), which were integral to Israelite worship.<p><b>They are to bring it to the house of our God</b><br>The "house of our God" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Bringing offerings to the temple was a significant act of devotion and obedience. The temple served as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people, making it a focal point for religious life and community identity.<p><b>to burn on the altar of the LORD our God</b><br>The altar was a sacred place where sacrifices and offerings were made to God. Burning wood on the altar was necessary for the burnt offerings, which symbolized atonement and dedication to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). This act of burning offerings was a tangible expression of worship and reverence, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>as it is written in the Law</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of adhering to the Mosaic Law, which governed religious and social life in Israel. The Law provided detailed instructions for worship and offerings, ensuring that the Israelites maintained a proper relationship with God. This adherence to the Law reflects a commitment to God's covenant and foreshadows the fulfillment of the Law through Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for temple duties, including sacrifices and maintaining the spiritual life of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The broader community of Israelites who participated in the covenant renewal and temple service.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_god.htm">The House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/casting_lots.htm">Casting Lots</a></b><br>A method used to make decisions or distribute responsibilities, believed to reflect God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_worship.htm">Commitment to Worship</a></b><br>The Israelites' dedication to providing wood for the altar demonstrates their commitment to maintaining worship practices.

But times had changed. The hill-country of Judaea had gradually been stripped of its forests. The temple was, comparatively speaking, poor, and some permanent arrangement for the supply of the required fuel had become necessary. It would seem, from the present passage, that the arrangement actually made was one by which different families or districts undertook the duty of furnishing the wood in turn, and lots were cast to determine the order in which they should discharge the office. According to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 17, &sect; 6), the wood needed for a year was brought in on a particular day - the fourteenth day of the fifth month - which was kept as a festival, and known as the "Xylophoria." <span class="cmt_word">At times appointed year by year</span>. It may be gathered from this that, originally, no single day was selected for bringing in all the wood; much less one and the same day appointed for every year. The original system was variable and elastic; but in course of time a rigid uniformity was introduced and established. <span class="cmt_word">As it is written in the law</span>.
