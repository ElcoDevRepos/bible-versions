It demonstrates the importance of seeking divine intervention in times of distress. The act of calling upon God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, seen in Psalms (<a href="/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>) and the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>), emphasizing reliance on God's power rather than human strength.<p><b>for we are despised</b><br>The Jews faced ridicule and contempt from their enemies, particularly Sanballat and Tobiah, who mocked their efforts to rebuild Jerusalem's walls. This scorn is reminiscent of the Israelites' experiences in Egypt and Babylon, where they were also despised and oppressed. The theme of God's people facing derision is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned they will face persecution (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>).<p><b>Turn their scorn back upon their own heads</b><br>This imprecatory prayer seeks justice, asking God to reverse the insults and plans of the enemies. It aligns with the principle of divine retribution found in the Old Testament, where God often turns the schemes of the wicked back on themselves (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>). This reflects a trust in God's justice and sovereignty.<p><b>and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity</b><br>This request for the enemies to experience the same fate they wish upon the Jews is a call for poetic justice. It echoes the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where the Jews themselves were taken captive. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and reversal of fortunes seen in prophetic literature, such as in the book of Revelation, where the oppressors of God's people face divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

He models the plea of <a href="/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>, &#8220;I call on You, for You will answer me, O God.&#8221; Like King Jehoshaphat in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>, he looks past human hostility to the Lord who rules every circumstance. By beginning with &#8220;Hear us,&#8221; he acknowledges that success in rebuilding Jerusalem&#8217;s wall rests entirely on God&#8217;s active intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For we are despised</b><p>Sanballat and Tobiah mock the workers (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1&#8211;3</a>), belittling their faith and effort. Nehemiah names the wound&#8212;&#8220;we are despised&#8221;&#8212;echoing the heart-cry of <a href="/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3-4</a>, where God&#8217;s people ask for mercy because they are &#8220;scorned by the proud.&#8221; Recognizing contempt is not self-pity; it is honest lament that drives the faithful to the One who sees and values them. Like David before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42-47</a>), ridicule becomes a platform for God to display His honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Turn their scorn back upon their own heads</b><p>Nehemiah petitions God to make the enemy reap what they sow, paralleling <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a> and <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>. This is righteous appeal, not personal vendetta; he entrusts vengeance to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) while he continues the work. Such imprecatory language underscores God&#8217;s justice: mocking His purposes is ultimately self-destructive. <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a> offers a vivid precedent&#8212;Haman is hanged on the gallows he built for Mordecai.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity</b><p>The builders themselves had only recently returned from exile; they know the weight of captivity. By asking that their foes be &#8220;plunder&#8221; in exile, Nehemiah invokes covenant warnings like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21-23</a>. He is not inventing a punishment; he is appealing to God to enforce the judgments He has already pronounced on persistent rebellion. <a href="/jeremiah/30-16.htm">Jeremiah 30:16</a> assures, &#8220;All who devour you will be devoured,&#8221; affirming that God defends His people and turns the plans of the wicked into instruments of His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a> captures a leader&#8217;s reflexive dependence on God amid scorn.

Compare Ezra's parenthetic burst of thanksgiving (<a href="/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). That which in Ezra was a sudden impulse has become a settled habit with Nehemiah (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14, 22, 29, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Turn their reproach upon their own head</span>.

Before men were taught to "love their enemies," and "bless those that cursed them" (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>), they gave vent to their natural feelings of anger and indignation by the utterance of maledictions. Nehemiah's spirit was hot and hasty; and as he records of himself (<a href="/nehemiah/13-25.htm">Nehemiah 13:25</a>) that he "cursed" certain Jews who had taken foreign wives, so it is not to be wondered at that he uttered imprecations against his persistent enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hear us,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1433;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
