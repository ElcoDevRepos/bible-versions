Nighttime provided cover from potential adversaries and allowed him to assess the situation without drawing attention. This reflects the wisdom and prudence often encouraged in Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, which speaks of the prudent seeing danger and taking refuge.<p><b>through the Valley Gate</b><br>The Valley Gate was located on the western side of Jerusalem, leading to the Valley of Hinnom. This gate's mention highlights Nehemiah's methodical approach to inspecting the city's defenses. The Valley of Hinnom later became associated with Gehenna, a symbol of judgment, which underscores the spiritual significance of Nehemiah's mission to restore Jerusalem.<p><b>toward the Well of the Serpent</b><br>The Well of the Serpent, also known as the Dragon Spring, is a location that is not clearly identified today. Its mention may symbolize the lurking dangers and challenges Nehemiah faced. The serpent is often a biblical symbol of evil or opposition, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, which may foreshadow the resistance Nehemiah would encounter.<p><b>and the Dung Gate</b><br>The Dung Gate was situated in the southern part of the city, leading to the Valley of Hinnom. It was used for disposing of refuse, symbolizing the cleansing and purification necessary for the city's restoration. This gate's mention emphasizes the need for removing impurities, akin to the spiritual cleansing found in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<p><b>and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem</b><br>Nehemiah's inspection of the walls signifies a thorough assessment of the damage and the work required for restoration. This act of inspection is akin to self-examination encouraged in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>, where believers are urged to test themselves in faith. It also reflects the importance of understanding the full scope of a problem before addressing it.<p><b>that had been broken down</b><br>The broken walls symbolize vulnerability and disgrace, as a city's walls were its primary defense. This condition reflects the spiritual and moral decay of the people, paralleling the brokenness described in <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>. Nehemiah's mission to rebuild is a type of Christ's redemptive work to restore what is broken.<p><b>and the gates that had been destroyed by fire</b><br>The destruction by fire indicates a complete and devastating ruin, often associated with divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>. The gates' destruction underscores the severity of Jerusalem's plight and the urgent need for restoration. Nehemiah's role as a restorer prefigures Christ, who rebuilds and restores the spiritual gates of believers' lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is deeply concerned about the state of Jerusalem and its walls.
