His displeasure is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, which required the temple to remain holy. This phrase highlights Nehemiah's role as a reformer and protector of the faith, echoing the zeal of figures like Moses and Elijah who also acted decisively against idolatry and corruption (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>).<p><b>and threw all of Tobiah&#8217;s household goods out of the room</b><br>Tobiah, an Ammonite official, had been given a room in the temple courts, which was a direct violation of the Law that prohibited Ammonites from entering the assembly of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>). Nehemiah's actions symbolize the cleansing of the temple, reminiscent of Jesus driving out the money changers (<a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15</a>). This act underscores the importance of maintaining the holiness of God's dwelling place and serves as a physical representation of spiritual purification.
