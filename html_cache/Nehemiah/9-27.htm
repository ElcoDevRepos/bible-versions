The Israelites often turned away from God, leading to their subjugation by surrounding nations. This pattern underscores the consequences of disobedience and the fulfillment of divine warnings given through the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). The oppression by enemies such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites served as a form of divine discipline intended to bring the Israelites back to repentance.<p><b>and in their time of distress they cried out to You</b><br>The Israelites' cry to God in times of distress is a common theme in the Old Testament, illustrating their recognition of God's sovereignty and mercy. This act of crying out signifies repentance and a return to faith, as seen in <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9 and 6</a>:6-7. It highlights the importance of turning to God in times of trouble and acknowledges His role as a deliverer. This pattern of crying out and divine response is a testament to God's readiness to forgive and restore His people when they seek Him earnestly.<p><b>From heaven You heard them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omnipresence and His attentive nature. Despite the Israelites' repeated failures, God remains willing to listen and respond to their pleas. The concept of God hearing from heaven is also found in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear and heal the land if His people humble themselves and pray. It reassures believers of God's accessibility and His desire to maintain a relationship with His people.<p><b>and in Your great compassion You gave them deliverers</b><br>God's compassion is a central theme in the narrative of Israel's history. Despite their rebellion, God's mercy leads Him to raise up deliverers, or judges, to rescue the Israelites from their oppressors. Figures like Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, and Gideon serve as instruments of God's salvation. This compassion is a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's mercy and provides salvation for all humanity.<p><b>who saved them from the hands of their enemies</b><br>The deliverers, empowered by God, brought salvation to the Israelites, freeing them from the oppression of their enemies. This deliverance is both physical and spiritual, as it restores the Israelites to a right relationship with God. The concept of salvation from enemies is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate Savior who delivers humanity from sin and death (<a href="/luke/1-71.htm">Luke 1:71</a>).

This was not abandonment but loving discipline (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>). The oppression described here echoes the recurring pattern of the book of Judges&#8212;foreign powers such as Mesopotamia, Moab, Midian, and Philistia subjugated Israel whenever the nation drifted into idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>). By handing them over, the Lord exposed the futility of their self-rule and reminded them that real security rests only in obedient fellowship with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in their time of distress they cried out to You</b><p>Hardship accomplished its purpose: it awakened contrition. <a href="/psalms/107-12.htm">Psalm 107:12-13</a> paints the same picture&#8212;&#8220;They fell down with no one to help; then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble.&#8221; Genuine repentance is more than regret; it is a turning back to God&#8217;s authority (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). The people&#8217;s cry demonstrates that, despite repeated failure, they still knew where deliverance could be found.

Hearing here implies willing engagement, the same divine attentiveness shown when Israel groaned in Egyptian slavery (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-24</a>). Even after multiplied apostasies, heaven remained responsive. This underscores the unchanging character of God who &#8220;does not change like shifting shadows&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).

Compassion&#8212;not human merit&#8212;motivated Him (<a href="/psalms/106-41.htm">Psalm 106:41-45</a>).

God&#8217;s pattern is clear:<p>&#8226; Discipline for sin<p>&#8226; Distress that prompts repentance<p>&#8226; Divine hearing<p>&#8226; Deliverance through a chosen savior<p>That cycle reveals both His justice and His mercy, showing that He will not ignore sin yet delights to forgive and restore (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a> captures Israel&#8217;s historical cycle: sin led to oppression, oppression led to repentance, repentance met God&#8217;s attentive mercy, and mercy produced deliverance. The verse affirms God&#8217;s sovereign control, unwavering righteousness, and overflowing compassion. For every believer, it is a sober reminder that disobedience invites discipline, yet a hopeful assurance that sincere cries for help reach heaven and receive gracious rescue through the ultimate Deliverer, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Their</span> <span class= "bld">enemies who vexed them.</span>--The phraseology in this and the following verse shows that the Book of Judges is carefully remembered in the prayer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou gavest them saviours</span>. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Othniel and Ehud (who are called "saviours," <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9, 15</a>), Shamgar, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Saul, David, etc. The writer seems to have the history of "Judges" especially in his mind (see the next verse). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So You delivered them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tit&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
