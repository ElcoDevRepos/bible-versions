This gate likely faced toward the territory of Ephraim, symbolizing the connection and unity between the northern and southern tribes. Historically, this gate was significant for trade and communication. It is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>, where King Joash of Israel broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate.<p><b>the Jeshanah Gate</b><br>The Jeshanah Gate, also known as the Old Gate, is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a>. It is believed to be one of the older gates of the city, possibly located in the northwest part of Jerusalem. The name "Jeshanah" means "old," indicating its historical significance. This gate's mention highlights the restoration efforts of Nehemiah, emphasizing the importance of preserving historical and spiritual heritage.<p><b>the Fish Gate</b><br>The Fish Gate was located on the northern wall of Jerusalem and was named for its proximity to the fish market, where fish from the Mediterranean Sea were brought in. This gate is mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-10.htm">Zephaniah 1:10</a>, indicating its importance in the city's economy and daily life. The Fish Gate's restoration symbolizes the renewal of economic prosperity and community life in Jerusalem.<p><b>the Tower of Hananel</b><br>The Tower of Hananel was a significant defensive structure on the northern wall of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>, symbolizing strength and protection. The tower's name, meaning "God is gracious," reflects the divine protection over Jerusalem. Its inclusion in Nehemiah's procession underscores the theme of God's faithfulness in restoring and safeguarding His people.<p><b>and the Tower of the Hundred</b><br>The Tower of the Hundred, also known as the Tower of Meah, was another important fortification on the northern wall. Its name may refer to a military unit or a measurement, indicating its strategic importance. The presence of such towers highlights the need for vigilance and defense, both physically and spiritually, as the people of Jerusalem sought to rebuild their city and their faith.<p><b>as far as the Sheep Gate</b><br>The Sheep Gate was located near the temple and was used for bringing in sheep for sacrifices. It is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>, where the high priest and fellow priests are noted for rebuilding it. This gate's significance lies in its connection to temple worship and sacrificial practices, foreshadowing Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>And they stopped at the Gate of the Guard</b><br>The Gate of the Guard, also known as the Inspection Gate, was likely used for military and security purposes. It symbolizes the need for spiritual vigilance and accountability. The procession stopping here may represent a moment of reflection and dedication, as the people of Jerusalem commit to guarding their renewed city and faith.
