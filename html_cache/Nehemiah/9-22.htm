The Israelites' conquest of Canaan was not due to their own strength but was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The giving of kingdoms and peoples underscores God's control over history and His ability to orchestrate events for His purposes. This divine allocation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God is seen as the ultimate authority over all nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>).<p><b>and allotted to them every corner of the land.</b><br>The allotment of land to the Israelites was a fulfillment of the covenant promise made to the patriarchs. This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of God's provision, ensuring that every part of the Promised Land was distributed among the tribes of Israel. The division of the land is detailed in the book of Joshua (Joshua 13-21), where each tribe receives its inheritance. This distribution was not only a physical blessing but also a spiritual one, as it established Israel as a nation under God's rule.<p><b>So they took the land of Sihon king of Heshbon</b><br>Sihon was an Amorite king whose territory was east of the Jordan River. The Israelites' victory over Sihon is recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-37</a>. This conquest was significant as it marked the beginning of Israel's possession of the land promised to them. The defeat of Sihon demonstrated God's power and faithfulness, serving as a precursor to the larger conquests in Canaan. It also fulfilled the prophecy given to Moses that Israel would possess the land of the Amorites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>).<p><b>and of Og king of Bashan.</b><br>Og was another powerful king whose defeat is recounted in <a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>. Bashan was known for its fertile land and strong cities, making Og's defeat a notable victory for Israel. The conquest of Og, like that of Sihon, was a testament to God's might and His commitment to His promises. Og's defeat is often mentioned alongside Sihon's as a reminder of God's past deliverance (<a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a>).

Israel did not conquer by chance; the victories were gifts (<a href="/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2-3</a>).<p>- By praising God for &#8220;giving,&#8221; the people confess that every throne and border change rested in His hands (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and peoples</b><p>- Kingdoms come with subjects.

Their displacement was both an act of justice and a fulfillment of covenant mercy to Israel (<a href="/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23-24</a>).<p>- This gift of &#8220;peoples&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s comprehensive provision&#8212;He supplies land, security, and societal structures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and allotted to them every corner of the land</b><p>- &#8220;Allotted&#8221; points to the orderly distribution described in <a href="/bsb/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a> and executed in <a href="/bsb/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14&#8211;21</a>.<p>- Nothing was left vague; every boundary, from the Negev to Lebanon, came under God&#8217;s precise direction (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p>- By mentioning &#8220;every corner,&#8221; Nehemiah stresses total fulfillment.
