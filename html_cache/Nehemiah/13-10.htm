The Levites, who were set apart for temple service, relied on the tithes and offerings of the people (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). This neglect indicates a lapse in the spiritual and communal responsibilities of the Israelites, reflecting a broader issue of covenant unfaithfulness. The failure to support the Levites suggests a disregard for the worship and service of God, which was central to Israel's identity and relationship with Him.<p><b>all the Levites and singers responsible for performing the service</b><br>The Levites and singers had specific roles in the temple, including assisting the priests, maintaining the temple, and leading worship through music (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>). Their service was vital for the spiritual life of the community, facilitating worship and maintaining the temple's operations. The mention of singers highlights the importance of music in worship, a tradition that continues in Christian worship today. The neglect of their support reflects a breakdown in the community's spiritual priorities.<p><b>had gone back to their own fields</b><br>Due to the lack of provision, the Levites and singers returned to their fields to sustain themselves, abandoning their temple duties. This return to agricultural work signifies a shift from their God-ordained roles, disrupting the temple's function and the community's worship life. It underscores the practical consequences of neglecting God's commands and the interconnectedness of spiritual and material responsibilities.
