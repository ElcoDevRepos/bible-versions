In the context of Nehemiah, it refers to those who were part of the community returning to Jerusalem to help rebuild and repopulate the city. This reflects the communal effort and unity among the Israelites during the post-exilic period, emphasizing the importance of leadership and collective action in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>Gabbai and Sallai</b><br>These names are likely of Hebrew origin, and they represent individuals who were leaders or notable figures among the returning exiles. The mention of specific names highlights the personal commitment and responsibility of these individuals in the restoration efforts. It also serves to honor those who played significant roles in the community's reestablishment. The inclusion of their names in the biblical record underscores the value of each person's contribution to God's work.<p><b>928 men</b><br>This number signifies the size of the group associated with Gabbai and Sallai. It reflects the organized and substantial effort to repopulate Jerusalem, which was crucial for the city's defense, economic stability, and religious life. The specific number also indicates the detailed record-keeping and planning involved in the return from exile. This mirrors other biblical accounts where numbers are used to convey the scale of God's work among His people, such as the census in the Book of Numbers. The precision of the number underscores the historical reliability of the biblical narrative and the importance of each individual in the collective mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the Jewish people after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gabbai.htm">Gabbai</a></b><br>One of the leaders or heads of the people who returned to Jerusalem.

Jerusalem&#8217;s walls now stand secure, yet the population is sparse (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a>).
