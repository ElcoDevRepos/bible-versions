The "law of your God" refers to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Jewish life and worship. The "law of the king" refers to the decrees of the Persian king, Artaxerxes, who ruled over the Jewish people at this time. This duality reflects the historical context of the Jewish return from Babylonian exile, where they were allowed to practice their religion under the oversight of Persian authority. The cooperation between religious and secular laws underscores the importance of maintaining order and respect for both divine and earthly governance.<p><b>let a strict judgment be executed against him</b><br>The phrase indicates the seriousness with which violations of these laws were to be treated. The term "strict judgment" suggests a legal system that was both rigorous and swift in its execution of justice. This reflects the Persian administrative efficiency and the importance of maintaining order in the vast empire. The emphasis on strict judgment also aligns with the biblical principle of justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges are instructed to judge fairly and without partiality.<p><b>whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment</b><br>These penalties reflect the range of consequences for disobedience, emphasizing the severity of the law. "Death" as a penalty underscores the ultimate seriousness of certain offenses, aligning with the Mosaic Law's capital punishments for specific transgressions. "Banishment" indicates exile from the community, a significant punishment in a culture where community and land were integral to identity. "Confiscation of property" reflects the economic impact of disobedience, serving as a deterrent and a means of restitution. "Imprisonment" was less common in ancient Israel but was a recognized form of punishment in the Persian legal system. These penalties collectively highlight the importance of adherence to both divine and royal laws, ensuring the stability and prosperity of the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.
