This reflects the biblical principle of leadership accountability, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>, where Moses appoints leaders to judge the people. The leaders are to act on behalf of the entire assembly, emphasizing the importance of godly leadership in guiding the community back to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at an appointed time,</b><br>This phrase addresses the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, which was contrary to the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The concern was not ethnic but religious, as these marriages often led to idolatry and a departure from worshiping Yahweh alone. The appointed time indicates an organized and deliberate approach to resolving the issue, ensuring that each case is handled justly and in accordance with the law.<p><b>together with the elders and judges of each town,</b><br>The involvement of local elders and judges underscores the decentralized nature of Israelite governance, where local leaders played a crucial role in maintaining order and justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>). This structure allowed for community-specific issues to be addressed effectively, ensuring that the resolution was both fair and comprehensive.<p><b>until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase reflects the theological understanding that God's anger is provoked by covenant unfaithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>. The community's actions are aimed at repentance and restoration, seeking to appease God's wrath and restore His favor. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where repentance and faith in Christ turn away God's wrath (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>). The urgency and seriousness of the situation highlight the need for immediate and sincere action to restore the community's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

OPPOSITION OF JONATHAN AND OTHERS (ver. 15). It was natural that some opposition should manifest itself when so trenchant a measure was announced as that which Ezra had declared to be necessary. To compel men to divorce their wives was to touch many in the tenderest place. Nor was it difficult to bring forward very plausible arguments to show that the marriages - or at any rate some of them - were allowable. Joseph had married an Egyptian (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>), Moses a Midianite (<a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>). True, these marriages had taken place before the law was given; but subsequently, also, Boaz had married Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>); David had taken to wife Maacah, a Geshurite (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>); and Solomon had without blame married the daughter of a Pharaoh (<a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). These examples might be pleaded in proof that the Law admitted of exceptions, and individuals might argue that their cases were of an exceptional character. Again, in some instances the foreign wives may have become proselytes, and the children may have been circumcised, and so accepted into the congregation; which would give them a claim to remain, which would extend in some degree to the mothers. We therefore cannot be surprised that an opposition was made. Rather, it is remarkable that it was so slight, only extending (so far as appears) to four persons, and so easily quelled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let our leaders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1440;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
