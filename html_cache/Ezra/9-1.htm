The phrase sets the stage for the subsequent issues that arise, indicating a transition from physical restoration to spiritual challenges.<p><b>the leaders approached me and said</b><br>The leaders here are likely the heads of the families or elders of Israel.

God had been faithful to fulfill His promises&#8212;just as He had in &#8220;the good hand of the LORD&#8221; over Ezra (<a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>). This context heightens the shock of what follows. Blessing brought responsibility, echoing truths seen earlier: after Israel crossed the Red Sea, the call to covenant obedience came (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>); after the walls went up in Nehemiah&#8217;s day, the Law was publicly read (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>). God&#8217;s deliverance always invites wholehearted devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the leaders approached me and said</b><p>The initiative comes from the civil and religious heads of the community&#8212;those charged with guarding national holiness (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). Their approach signals urgency and accountability. <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;faithful are the wounds of a friend&#8221;; genuine leadership confronts sin rather than concealing it. Ezra himself models this quality later when he tears his robe and falls on his knees (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-5</a>), joining the long line of intercessors like Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-32</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate</b><p>The crisis touches every layer of society, even those ordained to teach and model holiness (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10-11</a>). God&#8217;s design from the outset was that His people be distinct&#8212;&#8220;You are to be holy to Me&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). Yet compromise had crept in, echoing earlier failures when priests married foreign wives (<a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6-13</a>). Spiritual drift rarely starts in the pew; it often begins in the pulpit. Paul later draws on the same principle: &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the surrounding peoples whose abominations are like those of</b><p>Separation was moral, not racial. The term &#8220;abominations&#8221; points to idolatry, sexual immorality, and child sacrifice that characterized the nations (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-13</a>). Israel&#8217;s mission was to be a light (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>), not to blend into darkness. Compromise blurs the witness and invites discipline, as seen when Solomon&#8217;s heart turned after foreign gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites</b><p>This catalog recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-4</a>, where God explicitly warned against intermarriage with these very groups &#8220;for they will turn your sons away from following Me.&#8221; Including Egypt underscores the persistent allure of old bondage (<a href="/exodus/14-12.htm">Exodus 14:12</a>). The mention of Moab and Ammon reminds readers of past entanglements with Balaam and Baal-Peor (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>). God&#8217;s list is precise because His concern is pastoral: every tolerated idol becomes a seed of apostasy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a> exposes a heartbreaking reality: fresh from God&#8217;s gracious restoration, the returned exiles were already mingling with the very sins that had led to exile. Leadership courageously brings the issue to light, reminding us that holiness is a community project. The verse warns that blessing does not inoculate against compromise; vigilance and obedience must follow every victory. Above all, it underscores God&#8217;s unchanging call for His people to be distinct, guarding the purity of worship so the nations might see His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">IX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now when these things were done.</span>--The remainder of the book is occupied with the execution of Ezra's function as a moral reformer. One chief disorder is mentioned, that of the mixed marriages (<a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>), which the new lawgiver evidently regarded as fatal to the purity of the Divine service, and to the design of God in separating for a season this peculiar people.<p>(1-4) The report of the abuse of mixed marriages is formally brought before Ezra.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The princes</span>--Heads of tribes, native rulers of Jerusalem, as distinguished from the satraps and governors.

At the same time, many of these races still lingered in the neighbourhood of Judaea.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">The holy seed.</span>--The "holy nation" or "peculiar people" of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

Ezra reached Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month (<a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>), rested three days (<a href="/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>), and on the fourth day of the same month made over the vessels to the temple authorities. It was not till the seventeenth day of the ninth month that, on Ezra's motion, the matter of the mixed marriages was taken in hand (<a href="/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8, 9</a>).

The complaint was not so much that the Jews had as yet actually adopted idolatrous functions, as that they did not keep themselves wholly aloof from them.
