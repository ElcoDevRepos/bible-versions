His leadership is pivotal in re-establishing the Law of Moses among the returned exiles. The act of standing up signifies authority and readiness to address the assembly, a common practice for leaders in ancient Israel. Ezra's position as a priest underscores his role as a mediator between God and the people, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the issue at hand.<p><b>You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women</b><br>The unfaithfulness mentioned here refers to the Israelites' violation of the covenant with God by intermarrying with foreign women. This was not merely a social issue but a spiritual one, as these marriages often led to idolatry and the dilution of religious purity, as seen in the history of Israel (e.g., Solomon's marriages in <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The Law explicitly warned against such unions (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>) to prevent the influence of pagan practices. This phrase highlights the recurring theme of Israel's struggle to remain distinct and faithful to God amidst surrounding nations.<p><b>adding to the guilt of Israel</b><br>The concept of collective guilt is significant in the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals could impact the entire community. This phrase indicates that the sin of intermarriage was not isolated but contributed to the broader disobedience of the nation. The guilt of Israel is a recurring theme, seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and restoration throughout the Old Testament. This communal aspect of sin underscores the importance of corporate responsibility and repentance, as seen in the communal confessions in <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a> and <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

God had raised him up &#8220;because the good hand of the LORD was upon him&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>), so the people could not shrug off what was coming as personal opinion. They were about to hear the Word of God through a God-appointed mediator, much like Israel had heard through Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9&#8211;13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood up</b><p>His physical act of rising conveys urgency and gravity (<a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>).

Open sin demands open confrontation (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). As Paul would later write, &#8220;Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). Ezra&#8217;s words model that balance: corrective but aimed at restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"You have been unfaithful</b><p>The charge is spiritual adultery, &#8220;unfaithful&#8221; or &#8220;treacherous&#8221; (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10&#8211;11</a>). In covenant terms, faithfulness equals exclusive loyalty to the LORD. Any rival love&#8212;even cultural accommodations&#8212;breaks the marriage-like bond God formed with His people at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by marrying foreign women,</b><p>The issue is not ethnicity but idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).

God&#8217;s people are continually warned not to yoke themselves with unbelief (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>). Marriage is the most intimate covenant on earth; when entered against God&#8217;s clear command, it becomes a direct assault on His covenant in heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>adding to the guilt of Israel.</b><p>Their disobedience was compounding an already weighty national sin (<a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-14.htm">Numbers 32:14</a>). Sin is never isolated; it spreads like leaven (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>) and invites collective judgment (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). Scripture shows that unchecked compromise by a few endangers the many&#8212;think Achan (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>) or the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25</a>).

Israel&#8217;s men had violated God&#8217;s explicit command by marrying idol-worshiping wives, thereby embracing the very snares that once led to exile. Ezra&#8217;s rebuke reminds every generation that covenant loyalty matters, that private choices carry public consequences, and that swift repentance is the only path to restored fellowship with the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the priest stood up</span>.
