It reflects the continuation of the policy initiated by Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. The "elders of the Jews" refers to the leaders responsible for overseeing the reconstruction. This decree underscores the importance of the temple as a central place of worship and identity for the Jewish people. The rebuilding of the temple is a fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God declares that Cyrus will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt."<p><b>The cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal treasury:</b><br>This phrase indicates the financial support provided by the Persian Empire for the temple's reconstruction. The royal treasury's involvement highlights the political and economic power of the Persian Empire and its influence over the region. It also demonstrates God's provision for His people through unexpected means, as the funding comes from a foreign power. This mirrors the way God often uses unlikely sources to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the story of Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>Out of the taxes of the provinces west of the Euphrates:</b><br>The provinces west of the Euphrates, known as "Beyond the River," were part of the Persian Empire's administrative divisions. This area included regions such as Syria and Palestine. The use of taxes from these provinces to fund the temple's reconstruction shows the empire's vast resources and organizational structure. It also reflects the strategic importance of the region, as controlling it was crucial for maintaining the empire's stability and influence.<p><b>So that the work will not be hindered:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the temple's reconstruction proceeds without interruption. The decree aims to remove any financial or logistical obstacles that might delay the work. This reflects a broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to accomplish His purposes despite opposition. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of building His church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>), illustrating the unstoppable nature of God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius_i.htm">Darius I</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to support the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_jews.htm">Elders of the Jews</a></b><br>Jewish leaders responsible for overseeing the reconstruction of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_god.htm">House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was being rebuilt after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/royal_treasury.htm">Royal Treasury</a></b><br>The source of funding for the temple's reconstruction, as ordered by King Darius.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trans-euphrates.htm">Trans-Euphrates</a></b><br>The region from which the revenues were to be drawn to support the temple project.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty in Provision</a></b><br>God can use unexpected sources, even foreign rulers, to provide for His purposes.

The decree of Cyrus is not enough. I add to it, and require you <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to pay the wages of the workmen employed out of the royal revenue, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to supply the temple perpetually with all that is needed for the regular sacrifices (see ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">What ye shall do</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the elders.</span> Not, "Lest ye do anything to the elders" (LXX.); much less, "What must be done by the elders" (Vulg.); but, as in the A. V., "What ye shall do <span class="accented">to</span> them" - how ye shall act <span class="accented">towards</span> them. <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expences be given to these men</span>. The Persian satraps had to collect from their provinces a certain fixed sum as the royal tribute, and had to remit this sum annually to the court. Darius orders that the expenses of the men employed on the temple shall be paid by the satrap of Syria out of the royal tribute of his province, and only the balance remitted. Thus no additional burthen was laid upon the taxpayers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I hereby</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
