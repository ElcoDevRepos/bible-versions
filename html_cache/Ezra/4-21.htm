The historical context is crucial here; the Jews had returned from Babylonian exile and were attempting to rebuild Jerusalem. The opposition from local inhabitants, including Samaritans, was significant. This command shows the political power dynamics at play, where the Persian Empire had control over the region. The phrase also highlights the theme of opposition faced by God's people, a recurring motif throughout the Bible, seen in Nehemiah's struggles and the early church's persecution in Acts.<p><b>so that this city will not be rebuilt</b><br>The rebuilding of Jerusalem was a significant event in Jewish history, symbolizing restoration and hope. The city held religious, cultural, and political importance. The opposition to its rebuilding can be seen as an attempt to thwart God's plans for His people. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of Jerusalem as a central place in God's redemptive history, seen in prophecies like those in Isaiah and Zechariah, and ultimately in the New Jerusalem described in Revelation.<p><b>until I so order</b><br>This clause indicates the temporary nature of the decree, suggesting that the situation could change with a future command. It reflects the sovereignty of earthly kings but also points to the ultimate sovereignty of God, who controls the hearts of kings (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). Historically, this foreshadows the eventual decree by King Cyrus, allowing the Jews to return and rebuild, as prophesied by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). It also typifies the waiting and perseverance required of God's people, trusting in His timing and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem.
