The hiring of counselors suggests a formal and possibly legal approach to thwart the plans of the Israelites. In the ancient Near Eastern context, counselors were often skilled in law and diplomacy, and their involvement implies that the opposition was well-organized and possibly involved in lobbying Persian officials. This reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare and opposition faced by God's people throughout biblical history.<p><b>to frustrate their plans</b><br>The intent was to create confusion and delay in the rebuilding of the temple. This frustration of plans can be seen as a tactic used by adversaries to discourage and demoralize the Israelites. Theologically, this reflects the ongoing struggle between God's purposes and the forces that seek to hinder them. It also highlights the perseverance required by the faithful to overcome obstacles in fulfilling God's commands.<p><b>throughout the reign of Cyrus king of Persia</b><br>Cyrus the Great, who reigned from 559-530 BC, was the Persian king who initially allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>. His decree was seen as a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28, 45</a>:1). However, despite his favorable policies, local opposition persisted, indicating that even when political conditions seem favorable, challenges can still arise.<p><b>and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia</b><br>Darius I, who reigned from 522-486 BC, eventually supported the completion of the temple, as seen in <a href="/ezra/6.htm">Ezra 6:1-12</a>. The mention of his reign marks a period of continued opposition but also eventual triumph for the Israelites.
