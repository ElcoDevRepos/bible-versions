His reign is marked by administrative efficiency and support for local customs and religions, which facilitated the completion of the temple.

Haggai (<a href="/haggai/1-15.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact date of the re-commencement: the time therefore was four years five months and ten days. But, dating from the first foundation (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm" title="And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.">Ezra 3:10</a>), no less than twenty-one years had elapsed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">temple</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1005.htm">Strong's 1005: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was completed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
