In the ancient Near East, such communications were common for maintaining control over vast empires. The phrase suggests an appeal to authority, seeking intervention from the king.<p><b>that the Jews who came from you to us</b><br>This refers to the Jewish exiles who returned from Babylonian captivity. The return was sanctioned by previous Persian rulers, such as Cyrus the Great, who issued a decree allowing the Jews to return and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). The phrase highlights the connection between the Persian authority and the Jewish returnees.<p><b>have returned to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the central city of Jewish worship and identity, had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The return to Jerusalem was significant for the Jewish people, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, which spoke of restoration after exile.<p><b>and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city</b><br>This accusation reflects the perspective of the surrounding peoples who opposed the rebuilding efforts. Historically, Jerusalem had been a center of resistance against foreign powers, including the Babylonians and Assyrians. The terms "rebellious" and "wicked" are likely intended to provoke fear in the king, suggesting potential insurrection.<p><b>They are restoring its walls</b><br>The restoration of the walls was crucial for the security and autonomy of Jerusalem. Walls symbolized strength and protection, and their reconstruction was a significant step in re-establishing the city. Nehemiah later played a key role in this effort (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>).<p><b>and repairing its foundations</b><br>Repairing the foundations indicates a comprehensive rebuilding effort, not just superficial repairs. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal, as the physical restoration of Jerusalem paralleled the spiritual revival of the Jewish people. The foundations also symbolize the enduring promises of God to His people, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The returning exiles from Babylon who are rebuilding Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city being rebuilt, historically significant as the center of Jewish worship and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Refers to Artaxerxes, the Persian king to whom the letter is addressed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adversaries.htm">The Adversaries</a></b><br>Local officials and peoples who opposed the rebuilding efforts, viewing Jerusalem as a threat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebuilding_effort.htm">The Rebuilding Effort</a></b><br>The process of restoring Jerusalem's walls and foundations, symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/opposition_to_god's_work.htm">Opposition to God's Work</a></b><br>Expect resistance when undertaking God's work.

Throughout Scripture, enemies often appeal to government authority to hinder God&#8217;s people (<a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a>). By anchoring their complaint in &#8220;what the king should know,&#8221; they clothe opposition in apparent loyalty while masking hostility toward God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the Jews who came from you to us</b><p>The writers remind Artaxerxes that these Jews travelled under previous Persian decree (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a>). Their wording implies, &#8220;You are responsible for them,&#8221; hoping the king will feel obliged to correct an alleged mistake. Similar tactics appear when Sanballat tells Nehemiah, &#8220;It is reported&#8230;that you are planning to rebel&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/6-6.htm">Nehemiah 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have returned to Jerusalem</b><p>God had promised exile would end after seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). Now that promise is literal reality: the remnant stands in their covenant city (<a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a>). Their physical return mirrors God&#8217;s faithfulness, though opponents paint it as a political problem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city</b><p>Jerusalem&#8217;s past revolts under kings like Zedekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>) give enemies historical ammunition. They label the city &#8220;rebellious and wicked,&#8221; hoping the king will ignore God&#8217;s decree to rebuild (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Accusation is Satan&#8217;s ancient strategy (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>); here it surfaces through human voices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are restoring its walls</b><p>Walls signify security and distinct identity (<a href="/bsb/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>). Rebuilding them proclaims, &#8220;We are back and protected by our God.&#8221; Critics know a walled Jerusalem means renewed strength, so they exaggerate the threat. Yet Scripture celebrates restored walls as part of God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and repairing its foundations.</b><p>Foundations speak of permanence (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). The work is thorough, not cosmetic. By mending foundations, the returned exiles obey God&#8217;s charge to rebuild His dwelling place (<a href="/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8</a>). In a broader sense, God Himself is the only unshakable foundation (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>), and their labor reflects that truth in stone and mortar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Opponents craft a skillful letter: flattering the king, blaming the Jews, dredging up history, and casting normal construction as certain rebellion. Yet every charge unwittingly highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;He brought His people home, and He is enabling them to rebuild. What men label &#8220;rebellious and wicked,&#8221; God calls restored and chosen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) Virulence and craft and exaggeration are stamped on every sentence of the letter. It only says, however, that "they are preparing the walls thereof, and joining the foundations." Afterwards, however, the charge is modified in <a href="/ezra/4-13.htm" title="Be it known now to the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall damage the revenue of the kings.">Ezra 4:13</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-16.htm" title="We certify the king that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means you shall have no portion on this side the river.">Ezra 4:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews which came up from</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the central provinces - from that part of the empire where thou dwellest. To us.

There had been one, or perhaps two, previous revolts from Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); but of these the Samaritans probably knew nothing. They would, however, be likely to know that before Nebuchadnezzar took the extreme measure of removing the Jews from their own land to Babylon, they had rebelled against him three several times - once under Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>), once under his son Jehoiachin (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 10), and once under Zedekiah, the last king (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20). Thus they had a basis of truth on which to ground their charge that Jerusalem was "the rebellious and the bad city." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">have set up the walls thereof.</span> It appears very clearly from the book of Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem were not restored till his time, seventy-five years after this. The Samaritans, however, would naturally exaggerate, and call the rebuilding of the temple, and of a certain number of dwelling-houses, a fortifying of the place. The exaggeration, however, is not so great in the Chaldee text as in the Authorized Version. What is said seems to be, that "they <span class="accented">are setting up the walls and joining the foundations."</span> That the work was far from complete is admitted in the next verse.
