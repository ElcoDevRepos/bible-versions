The Israelites were returning from Babylonian exile and were re-establishing their identity as God's chosen people. Marrying foreign women was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>) because it often led to idolatry and a departure from worshiping Yahweh. The foreign women mentioned here were likely from surrounding nations that practiced different religions, which posed a threat to the purity of Israel's faith and covenant relationship with God. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of maintaining spiritual purity and separation from practices that could lead to idolatry.<p><b>and some of them had children by these wives</b><br>This phrase indicates the complexity and emotional difficulty of the situation. The presence of children suggests that these were not merely casual relationships but established families. The decision to separate from these wives and children, as described earlier in the chapter, would have been heart-wrenching and disruptive. It underscores the seriousness with which the community sought to rectify their disobedience to God's commands. This action can be seen as a drastic but necessary step to preserve the spiritual integrity of the nation. The situation also foreshadows the New Testament teaching on the cost of discipleship and the need to prioritize one's relationship with God above all else (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

Yet honest confession, decisive action, and transparent accountability open the door for restoration. May we learn from their example and cling to wholehearted devotion, trusting that obedience&#8212;however difficult&#8212;always leads to blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And some of them had wives by whom they had children.</span> Rather, "And there were some among the wives who had given birth to children."
