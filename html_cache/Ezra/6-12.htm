The concept of God's Name dwelling in a specific place is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, where God chooses a place for His Name to reside. The temple is not just a building but a symbol of God's covenant and presence among His people. This reflects the Shekinah glory that filled the temple, signifying God's approval and presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>).<p><b>overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to alter this decree</b><br>This part of the verse is a protective invocation against any opposition to the rebuilding of the temple. Historically, the decree by Darius was a continuation of the policies of Cyrus, who initially allowed the Jews to return and rebuild (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). The phrase underscores the divine protection over the temple project, suggesting that any opposition would face divine retribution, similar to how God protected Israel against their enemies in the past (<a href="/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>).<p><b>or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was central to Jewish worship and identity. Its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BC was a significant event, leading to the Babylonian exile. The rebuilding under Darius was a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) and a restoration of worship. The temple's significance is also seen in its typology of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men.<p><b>I, Darius, have issued the decree</b><br>Darius I, the Persian king, reigned from 522-486 BC. His decree was a legal and authoritative command that reinforced the earlier decree by Cyrus. This highlights the continuity of God's plan through different rulers and empires, showing that God can use even pagan kings to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). Darius's support was crucial for the completion of the temple, demonstrating God's sovereignty over history.<p><b>Let it be carried out with diligence</b><br>The call for diligence reflects the importance and urgency of the temple's completion. It underscores the need for faithful obedience to God's commands and the decrees of the king. This mirrors the biblical principle of working heartily as for the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The emphasis on diligence also serves as a reminder of the perseverance required in fulfilling God's work, as seen in the rebuilding efforts led by Zerubbabel and Jeshua (<a href="/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who has caused His Name to dwell in the temple, signifying His presence and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius.htm">Darius</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to support the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The sacred place where God's Name dwells, representing His covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_decree.htm">The Decree</a></b><br>A royal command by King Darius to ensure the protection and completion of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/opponents_of_the_temple.htm">Opponents of the Temple</a></b><br>Any king or people who might attempt to alter or destroy the temple, against whom the decree warns.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses even foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes.
