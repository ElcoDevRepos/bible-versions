Immer was one of the 24 priestly divisions established by King David (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>). This division was responsible for serving in the temple, highlighting the importance of maintaining purity and adherence to the Law among the priesthood. The mention of Immer here underscores the need for the priests to lead by example in the community's spiritual renewal.<p><b>Hanani and Zebadiah:</b><br>Hanani and Zebadiah are listed as individuals from the priestly line of Immer who had taken foreign wives, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). Their inclusion in this list signifies their willingness to repent and rectify their actions by sending away their foreign wives, as part of the community's commitment to reestablishing covenant faithfulness. This act of repentance is a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, where returning to God's commands is necessary for spiritual restoration. The names Hanani and Zebadiah, meaning "gracious" and "Yahweh has bestowed," respectively, reflect the hope of divine grace and blessing upon their repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon.
