The role of prophets in Israel was to convey God's will and guidance. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel often warned Israel about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of holiness. This underscores the continuity of God's message and His consistent call for His people to remain separate from the practices of surrounding nations.<p><b>The land that you are entering to possess</b><br>This refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The Israelites' journey to possess this land is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises. The land was not just a physical territory but a place where Israel was to live out its covenant relationship with God. The concept of entering and possessing the land also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ.<p><b>is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples</b><br>The term "polluted" indicates moral and spiritual corruption. The Canaanites practiced idolatry and engaged in various detestable acts, which were seen as defiling the land. This impurity is often linked to practices such as child sacrifice and sexual immorality, which were common among the Canaanite religions. The Israelites were warned not to adopt these practices (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>), as doing so would lead to their own defilement and eventual expulsion from the land.<p><b>and the abominations with which they have filled it from end to end.</b><br>"Abominations" refers to practices that are detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. The phrase "from end to end" suggests the pervasive nature of these practices throughout the land. This widespread corruption is why God commanded the Israelites to drive out the inhabitants and not to intermarry with them (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). The call to holiness and separation from sin is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the need for purity in the lives of God's people. This also serves as a type of Christ, who came to purify and redeem humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem and was instrumental in re-establishing the Law of Moses among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Servants of God who conveyed His messages to the people, warning them against idolatry and impurity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which the Israelites were to possess.

Possession of the land is a covenant privilege conditioned on holiness. The verse combines assurance&#8212;God is giving the land&#8212;with a stark warning: the very soil remembers the consequences of impurity.
