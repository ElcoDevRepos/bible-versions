Genealogies were crucial for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and fulfilling covenant promises. This emphasis on lineage is seen throughout the Bible, notably in the genealogies of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, which affirm His rightful place in the line of David. The preservation of these records was vital for maintaining the continuity of the Jewish people, especially after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>of those who returned with me from Babylon</b><br>The return from Babylon marks a significant event in Jewish history, known as the Second Exodus. This return was prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) and fulfilled as the exiles were allowed to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. Babylon, a symbol of captivity and exile, contrasts with Jerusalem, the city of God. The return signifies a restoration of worship and covenant relationship with God. Ezra, a scribe and priest, leads this group, emphasizing the importance of spiritual renewal alongside physical restoration.<p><b>during the reign of King Artaxerxes:</b><br>King Artaxerxes I of Persia reigned from 465-424 BC. His reign is significant for the Jewish people as he issued decrees that allowed Ezra and later Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem. This period is marked by Persian influence, yet it also highlights God's sovereignty in using foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes for Israel. Artaxerxes' support for Ezra's mission reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God uses Cyrus, a Persian king, to initiate the return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra is a central figure in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
