The gathering was significant, as it involved representatives from all tribes who had returned from exile. This reflects the communal nature of repentance and the collective responsibility of the people to address their sin. The large number of people also underscores the widespread nature of the issue at hand, which was intermarriage with foreign women, contrary to the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p><b>and it is the rainy season</b><br>The mention of the rainy season situates the event in a specific time of year, likely around November to December, when heavy rains were common in Israel. This detail provides insight into the practical challenges faced by the assembly. The rainy season would have made it difficult for the people to remain outside for extended periods, emphasizing the urgency and discomfort of the situation. The rains also symbolize cleansing and renewal, which aligns with the theme of repentance and purification.<p><b>We are not able to stay out in the open</b><br>This phrase indicates the physical limitations and discomfort faced by the people due to the weather conditions. It suggests a need for a practical solution to address the issue of intermarriage, as the people could not endure prolonged exposure to the elements. This logistical concern reflects the need for a structured and organized approach to repentance and reform, rather than a hasty or superficial resolution.<p><b>Nor is this the work of one or two days</b><br>The complexity and magnitude of the situation required a thorough and deliberate process. The phrase acknowledges that resolving the issue of intermarriage was not a simple task that could be accomplished quickly. It required careful examination and decision-making, reflecting the seriousness with which the community needed to address their transgression. This mirrors the biblical principle that true repentance involves a deep and sustained commitment to change.<p><b>for we have transgressed greatly in this matter</b><br>This confession of sin highlights the gravity of the people's disobedience. The use of "transgressed greatly" indicates a significant breach of covenant with God, as intermarriage with foreign women threatened the religious and cultural identity of Israel. This acknowledgment of sin is a crucial step in the process of repentance, aligning with biblical teachings on the importance of confession (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). The phrase also points to the need for divine forgiveness and restoration, themes central to the message of redemption found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.
