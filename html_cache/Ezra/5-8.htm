It reflects the bureaucratic processes of the Persian Empire, where local governors and officials reported to the central authority. This communication underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in governance, a principle that can be seen throughout biblical narratives.<p><b>that we went into the province of Judah</b><br>The province of Judah was a small, semi-autonomous region within the vast Persian Empire. This area, once the heart of the united kingdom of Israel under David and Solomon, had been reduced to a province after the Babylonian exile. The return of the exiles and the rebuilding efforts were significant in re-establishing Jewish identity and worship practices.<p><b>to the house of the great God</b><br>The "house of the great God" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was central to Jewish worship and identity. The use of "great God" acknowledges the supremacy of Yahweh, even in a polytheistic context. This temple was originally built by Solomon, destroyed by the Babylonians, and now being rebuilt, fulfilling prophecies such as those in Isaiah and Jeremiah about the restoration of Israel.<p><b>The people are rebuilding it with large stones</b><br>The use of "large stones" indicates the significant effort and resources being invested in the temple's reconstruction. This mirrors the original construction under Solomon, which also used large, costly stones. The rebuilding signifies a return to the glory and strength of the past, symbolizing spiritual renewal and divine favor.<p><b>and placing timbers in the walls</b><br>Timbers were essential for the structural integrity of ancient buildings, often used for beams and supports. The mention of timbers recalls the cooperation with the Phoenicians during Solomon's time, who provided cedar from Lebanon. This detail highlights the continuity of tradition and the importance of skilled craftsmanship in sacred architecture.<p><b>This work is being carried out diligently</b><br>The diligence in rebuilding reflects the commitment and zeal of the Jewish people to restore their place of worship. This dedication can be seen as a response to prophetic encouragements from Haggai and Zechariah, who urged the people to prioritize the temple's reconstruction as a sign of their covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and is prospering in their hands</b><br>The prosperity of the work indicates divine blessing and approval. This success can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to restore His people and their worship. It also serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate temple, the meeting place between God and humanity, and whose work prospers in the redemption and restoration of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Refers to King Darius of Persia, who was ruling during the time of the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_great_god.htm">The House of the Great God</a></b><br>This is the temple in Jerusalem, which the Jewish exiles were rebuilding after their return from Babylonian captivity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_province_of_judah.htm">The Province of Judah</a></b><br>The region where Jerusalem is located, under Persian rule at the time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/large_stones_and_timbers.htm">Large Stones and Timbers</a></b><br>Materials used in the construction of the temple, indicating the scale and seriousness of the project.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/diligence_and_prosperity.htm">Diligence and Prosperity</a></b><br>Describes the manner and success with which the Jewish people were undertaking the rebuilding project.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/diligence_in_god's_work.htm">Diligence in God's Work</a></b><br>The rebuilding of the temple was carried out with diligence.

It has been supposed (Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 571), on the strength of a doubtful passage in Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>), that Tatnai ordinarily resided at Jernsalem. But this expression indicates the contrary. Most probably the satrap of Syria held his court at Damascus. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the great God</span> is a remarkable expression in the mouth of a heathen. It has some parallels, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the expressions of Cyrus in <a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>, and of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> and Daniel 3:29; but they were persons who had been brought to the knowledge that Jehovah was the one true God, under very peculiar and miraculous circumstances. Tatnai, on the other hand, represents the mere ordinary Persian official; and his acknowledgment of the God of the Jews as "the great God" must be held to indicate the general belief of the Persians on the subject (see the comment on Ezra 1:2). <span class="cmt_word">Which is builded</span>. Rather, "being builded." <span class="cmt_word">With great stones.</span> Literally, "stones of rolling," which is commonly explained as stones so large that they had to be rolled along the ground. But the squared stones used in building neither were, nor could be, rolled; they are always represented as dragged, generally on a rough sledge. And it is not at all probable that in the "day of small things" (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) the Jews were building with very large stones. The LXX. translate "choice stones;" the Vulgate "unpolished" or "rough stone." Some of the Jewish expositors suggest "marble." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">timber is laid</span>. A good deal of timber had been employed in the old temple, but chiefly for the floors of chambers (<a href="/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>), for the internal lining of the walls (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 15), and probably for the roofing. In the new temple, timber seems to have been employed also as the main material of the party-walls. Here again we have a trace of the economy necessary in the "day of small things." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let it be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;&#1457;&#1493;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;h&#277;&#183;w&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become, come to pass, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">known</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;
