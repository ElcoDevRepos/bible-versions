The temple, rebuilt after the Babylonian exile, was central to Jewish worship and identity. The phrase underscores the importance of the temple as the dwelling place of God among His people, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The temple's significance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><b>that you may have occasion to supply</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the proactive role Ezra is to play in ensuring the temple's needs are met. Ezra, a scribe and priest, was tasked with leading a group of exiles back to Jerusalem and ensuring the proper worship of God. His role as a leader and reformer is crucial, as he is given authority to act as needed. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where God's people are entrusted with resources to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>you may pay for it from the royal treasury</b><br>This phrase reveals the support of the Persian king, Artaxerxes, for the Jewish people and their worship practices. The royal treasury's involvement signifies the political and economic backing for the temple's needs, illustrating God's sovereignty in using foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes. This support is reminiscent of God's provision through unexpected means, as seen in other biblical narratives, such as Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (Genesis 41). The involvement of the royal treasury also foreshadows the ultimate provision of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, providing access to God for all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader of the Jewish people returning from Babylonian exile.
