It underscores the importance of seeking favor and permission from the ruling authority, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This approach is consistent with biblical teachings on respecting governing authorities (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon</b><br>The request to search the royal archives indicates the existence of a well-organized record-keeping system in the Persian Empire. Babylon, as a major center of administration, housed important documents. This reflects the historical accuracy of the biblical narrative, as archaeological findings have confirmed the presence of such archives. The search for records is a testament to the importance of written decrees in maintaining legal and governmental continuity.<p><b>to see if King Cyrus did indeed issue a decree</b><br>King Cyrus of Persia is a significant figure in biblical history, known for his decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). This decree fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>), highlighting God's sovereignty in using foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes. The verification of this decree is crucial for the legitimacy of the Jewish efforts to rebuild the temple.<p><b>to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem</b><br>The rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem is central to the Jewish identity and worship. The temple was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people, and its reconstruction symbolized the restoration of the covenant relationship. This effort is a precursor to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), signifying the new covenant and the indwelling of God's presence through the Holy Spirit.<p><b>Then let the king send us his decision in this matter</b><br>The request for a decision from the king emphasizes the dependence of the Jewish leaders on the Persian authority for the continuation of their work. It reflects the political realities of the time, where the Jewish community was subject to the rule of a foreign empire. This situation foreshadows the ultimate reliance on God's sovereign will, as seen in the New Testament, where believers are called to trust in God's plan and timing (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_cyrus.htm">King Cyrus</a></b><br>The Persian king who initially issued the decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

Respectful appeal opens the door; diligent investigation confirms God&#8217;s prior decree; and a king&#8217;s forthcoming verdict will ultimately advance God&#8217;s unchanging purpose. The verse reminds us that history, governments, and documents all serve the Lord&#8217;s plan to establish true worship among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Let there be search made.</span>--All depended on the original decree, which nothing done intermediately by the usurper could cancel. And the request of Tatnai seems to imply that it would be found: although the original was not found in Babylon, as was expected, a copy had been made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let there be search made in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the king's treasure house.</span> The Vulgate has "in the king's library;" and this, though not the literal rendering, is probably what was intended by Tatuai. Libraries or record chambers were attached to the royal residences under the old Assyrian and Babylonian kings; and the practice was no doubt continued by the Persians. Some of these record offices have been recently found, and their stores recovered. In the year 1850 Mr. Layard came upon the royal library of Asshur-bani-pal at Koyunjik, and obtained from it several hundreds of documents. More recently, in 1875-6, some Arab explorers happened upon a similar collection near Babylon, which yielded from 3000 to 4000 tablets ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 6. pp. 4, 582). It is quite possible that the "decree of Cyrus" may still exist, and be one day recovered. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now, therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
