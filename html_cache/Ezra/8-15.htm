The canal flowing to Ahava is likely a waterway in Babylon, though its exact location is uncertain. This gathering reflects the importance of preparation and unity among the returning exiles. The assembly at Ahava signifies a moment of transition and readiness, echoing the Israelites' encampments during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The canal's mention highlights the logistical considerations of the journey, emphasizing God's provision of resources and guidance.<p><b>and we camped there three days</b><br>The three-day period of camping is significant, often symbolizing preparation, reflection, and divine intervention in Scripture. This time allowed Ezra to organize the group, ensure everyone was accounted for, and prepare spiritually for the journey ahead. The number three frequently appears in the Bible, symbolizing completeness and divine purpose (e.g., <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). This period of waiting and preparation parallels the Israelites' experiences, such as their three-day journey into the wilderness to worship God (<a href="/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>).<p><b>And when I searched among the people and priests</b><br>Ezra's search among the people and priests demonstrates his leadership and commitment to ensuring the proper composition of the group. This search underscores the importance of having a complete and prepared community for the task of rebuilding Jerusalem and restoring worship. Ezra's diligence reflects the biblical principle of seeking God's order and structure, as seen in the organization of the tribes of Israel (Numbers 2).<p><b>I found no Levites there</b><br>The absence of Levites is significant, as they were essential for temple service and worship. Levites were responsible for assisting the priests and maintaining the temple, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>. Their absence highlights a potential challenge in restoring proper worship in Jerusalem. This situation underscores the need for dedicated servants in God's work and the importance of each member's role in the community. Ezra's discovery prompts action to address this gap, reflecting the biblical theme of God's provision and the call to faithful service (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader of the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

The "river that runneth to Ahava" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) <span class="accented">eight</span> days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">We abode in tents</span>. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">I viewed</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> Rather, "I looked among the people" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no.
