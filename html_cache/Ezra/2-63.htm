His order safeguards the sanctity of &#8220;the most holy things&#8221; while awaiting divine confirmation through the Urim and Thummim.

They were pronounced to be excluded from priestly functions. Without ark or temple, the people had not as yet that special presence of Jehovah before which the high priest could "inquire of the Lord by Urim and Thummim." Zerubbabel might hope that this privilege would return, and thought the official purity of the priestly line of sufficient importance for such an inquiry. But the holy of holies in the new temple never had in it the ancient "tokens "; and by Urim and Thummim Jehovah was never again inquired of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Tirshatha</span>.

Zerubbabel evidently expected that the power of obtaining direct answers from God by means of the Urim and Thummim, whatever they were (see note on Exodus 28:30), which had existed in the pre-captivity Church, would be restored when the Church was re-established in its ancient home. The doubt whether the families of Habaiah and Coz (or Haccoz) belonged to the priestly class or no might then be resolved. But Zerubbabel's expectation was disappointed. The gift of Urim and Thum-mira, forfeited by disobedience, was never recovered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/2-63.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The governor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1433;&#1514;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;tir&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8660.htm">Strong's 8660: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a person title) governor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the most holy things</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;q&#333;&#183;&#7695;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6944.htm">Strong's 6944: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacred place, thing, sanctity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was a priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to consult the Urim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_224.htm">Strong's 224: </a> </span><span class="str2">Part of the high priest's breastplate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Thummim.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7791;um&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8550.htm">Strong's 8550: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perfections</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/2-63.htm">OT History: Ezra 2:63 The governor said to them that they (Ezr.
