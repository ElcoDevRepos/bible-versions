The altar's foundation likely refers to the original site of the altar in Solomon's Temple, emphasizing continuity with past worship practices. This act of setting up the altar first, even before the temple itself, highlights the centrality of sacrificial worship in Israel's relationship with God. The altar is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD&#8212;</b><br>Burnt offerings were a key component of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The act of offering sacrifices demonstrates obedience to the Mosaic Law and a desire to seek God's favor and forgiveness. This practice connects to the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and provides atonement for sin.<p><b>both the morning and evening burnt offerings&#8212;</b><br>The morning and evening sacrifices, also known as the Tamid offerings, were a daily ritual commanded in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>. These offerings represent continual devotion and reliance on God, serving as a reminder of His constant presence and provision. The regularity of these sacrifices underscores the importance of maintaining a consistent relationship with God, paralleling the Christian practice of daily prayer and devotion.<p><b>even though they feared the people of the land.</b><br>The fear of the surrounding peoples reflects the political and social tensions faced by the returning exiles. These groups, possibly including Samaritans and other local inhabitants, may have been hostile to the rebuilding efforts. Despite this fear, the Israelites prioritized their worship and obedience to God, demonstrating faith and courage. This situation mirrors the challenges faced by believers who must remain faithful amidst opposition, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a> about fearing God rather than man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The returning exiles who are rebuilding the altar and the temple in Jerusalem after their captivity in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The sacred place where sacrifices are made to God, symbolizing worship and atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples_of_the_land.htm">The Peoples of the Land</a></b><br>The surrounding nations and groups who were hostile or potentially threatening to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, signifying dedication and atonement, offered both morning and evening.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city where the temple and altar are being rebuilt, central to Jewish worship and identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_the_face_of_fear.htm">Faith in the Face of Fear</a></b><br>The Israelites set up the altar despite their fear of the surrounding peoples.

This was done, no doubt, to indicate that the religion which the exiles brought back from Babylon was in every respect identical with that which they had possessed before they were carried thither.

Notwithstanding their fear of the surrounding nations, they set up the altar. We must remember that their neighbours were not Persians, but descendants of various idolatrous nations - Hamathites, Babylonians, Susianians, Elamites, Cuthaeans, etc. - bitterly opposed to anything like a pure spiritual religion (see <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9, 10</a>). Though the exiles had permission from Cyrus to raise up not only their altar, but their temple, it was not at all certain that his nominal subjects would passively submit. It was as if a modern Turkish Sultan should decree the erection of a Christian altar and a grand Christian cathedral at Kerbela or Bussorah, towards the verge of his empire. There would be great danger in acting on such a decree. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offerings morning and evening</span>.
