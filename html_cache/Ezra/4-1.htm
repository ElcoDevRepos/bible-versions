These were primarily the people who had settled in the land during the Babylonian exile, including Samaritans and other groups. Historically, these groups had mixed religious practices and were often at odds with the returning Jews who sought to reestablish pure worship of Yahweh. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin were the primary tribes that returned from exile, representing the southern kingdom of Judah. This context highlights the ongoing tension between the returning exiles and the inhabitants of the land.<p><b>heard that the exiles were building a temple</b><br>The exiles, led by figures such as Zerubbabel and Jeshua, had returned to Jerusalem with the primary goal of rebuilding the temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rebuilding of the temple was a significant event, as it symbolized the restoration of proper worship and the reestablishment of the Jewish community in their ancestral land. The act of rebuilding was not just a physical task but a spiritual renewal, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in Isaiah and Jeremiah about the return from exile.<p><b>for the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between Yahweh and the people of Israel. The temple was to be dedicated to the LORD, distinguishing the worship of Yahweh from the syncretistic practices of the surrounding peoples. This dedication underscores the theological significance of the temple as the dwelling place of God among His people, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. The focus on the "God of Israel" reaffirms the identity of the returning exiles as the chosen people, set apart for God's purposes. This also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the true temple, where God's presence dwells among humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_judah_and_benjamin.htm">Enemies of Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>These were the adversaries of the Jewish people who had returned from exile.

Just as Sanballat and Tobiah later rose up &#8220;when&#8221; the walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-2</a>), so these adversaries surface the instant God&#8217;s people move forward.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that whenever God initiates restoration, resistance follows&#8212;think of Pharaoh as Israel prepared to leave Egypt (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-2</a>) or the Herodian plot the moment Jesus was born (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The label &#8220;enemies&#8221; is not exaggerated; it states fact. <a href="/psalms/83-2.htm">Psalm 83:2</a> affirms, &#8220;Your enemies roar,&#8221; and <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> warns believers to stay alert because the adversary still prowls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Judah and Benjamin</b><p>&#8226; Judah and Benjamin form the remnant tribes of the Southern Kingdom, carrying the lineage of David and the covenant promises (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Their identity matters: they are the custodians of Messiah&#8217;s line (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Attack on these tribes is ultimately an attack on God&#8217;s redemptive agenda. We see a similar focus on Judah in <a href="/zechariah/12-2.htm">Zechariah 12:2-3</a>, where surrounding nations gather against Jerusalem but the Lord pledges deliverance.<p>&#8226; The specificity&#8212;Judah and Benjamin&#8212;also highlights that opposition often targets the very core of God&#8217;s purposes rather than the periphery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard</b><p>&#8226; Word travels quickly where God&#8217;s work is concerned. <a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1-2</a> notes that Canaanite kings &#8220;heard&#8221; of Israel&#8217;s advance and formed a coalition.<p>&#8226; Hearing generates reaction: enemies rarely remain neutral after receiving news of divine activity. <a href="/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1-2</a> shows religious leaders reacting when they &#8220;heard&#8221; the apostles preach resurrection.<p>&#8226; For us, it underscores that spiritual opposition is alert, listening, and ready to push back whenever God&#8217;s people obey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the exiles</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;exiles&#8221; recalls God&#8217;s faithfulness.
