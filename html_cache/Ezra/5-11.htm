It reflects the Jews' confidence and clarity in their mission, rooted in divine authority rather than merely human permission.<p><b>We are servants of the God of heaven and earth:</b><br>This declaration emphasizes their allegiance to the one true God, who is sovereign over all creation. It contrasts with the polytheistic beliefs of surrounding nations and underscores the monotheistic faith of Israel.

The temple's reconstruction is a physical manifestation of spiritual renewal and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>that was built many years ago:</b><br>This refers to the original temple constructed by Solomon, which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC.

Solomon's temple was renowned for its grandeur and served as the focal point of Israel's religious life. The reference to Solomon as a "great king" acknowledges his wisdom and the prosperity of Israel during his reign, while also pointing to the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding his descendants and the establishment of a house for God's name.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_the_god_of_heaven_and_earth.htm">Servants of the God of Heaven and Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.
