In the historical context, letters were a primary means of communication between distant regions and rulers. The use of written communication highlights the bureaucratic nature of the Persian Empire, which maintained control over its vast territories through such documentation. This letter is part of a series of exchanges that reflect the political tensions surrounding the rebuilding efforts after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>has been translated</b><br>The need for translation indicates the linguistic diversity of the Persian Empire, which included many different peoples and languages. Aramaic was commonly used as a lingua franca in the empire, and it is likely that the original letter was written in this language. The translation process underscores the administrative complexity of the empire and the importance of accurate communication in governance. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's work transcending language barriers, as seen in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>and read in my presence</b><br>The phrase suggests that the letter was given significant attention by King Artaxerxes, who personally reviewed its contents. This indicates the seriousness with which the Persian administration regarded the situation in Jerusalem. The act of reading the letter in the king's presence also implies a formal and official response was forthcoming. In a broader biblical context, the reading of important documents in the presence of leaders is a recurring theme, as seen in the public reading of the Law in the Old Testament, emphasizing the authority and accountability of leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

Letters were a normal way to petition kings (see <a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/acts/23-25.htm">Acts 23:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s people often found their obedience challenged through written accusations, yet the Lord still advanced His purposes (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you sent us</b><p>&#8211; The plural &#8220;us&#8221; shows a bureaucratic chain: local officials forward the document to King Artaxerxes, illustrating how earthly power structures can oppose divine work (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8211; Earlier, verse 11 identifies the letter&#8217;s authors&#8212;enemies of Judah&#8212;reminding us that opposition is personal and persistent (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has been translated</b><p>&#8211; Persia ruled multi-ethnic provinces, so Aramaic correspondence had to be rendered into the imperial language for the king, highlighting God&#8217;s providence even in administrative details (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Similar care appears in <a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a> where the Levites &#8220;read from the Book of the Law of God, translating and giving the meaning&#8221; so all could understand.

Hearing charges aloud heightened their gravity, yet it also exposed them to evaluation and, ultimately, to God&#8217;s overruling hand (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p>&#8211; Hezekiah once spread a hostile letter &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>). Likewise, every accusation against God&#8217;s people eventually comes under His scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in my presence</b><p>&#8211; Artaxerxes emphasizes personal attention; he is not delegating this matter. Human authority seems decisive, but Scripture consistently shows the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty eclipsing royal decrees (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/ezra/7-23.htm">Ezra 7:23</a> depicts the same king later supporting temple worship.

What seemed like a setback became another step in the unfolding story that eventually saw the temple completed (<a href="/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14</a>).
