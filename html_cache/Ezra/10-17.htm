The first month in the Hebrew calendar is Nisan, which corresponds to March-April in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it precedes the Passover, a time of purification and remembrance of deliverance from Egypt. The completion of this task by this date underscores the need for spiritual renewal and purity before such a significant religious observance. The first month also marks the beginning of the agricultural year, symbolizing new beginnings and a fresh start for the community.<p><b>they had dealt with all the men</b><br>The phrase "dealt with" suggests a thorough and systematic approach to addressing the issue of intermarriage with foreign women. This was not merely a casual or superficial examination but a comprehensive resolution. The leaders, under Ezra's guidance, took responsibility to ensure that the community adhered to the covenant laws. This reflects the seriousness with which the community viewed the potential threat of idolatry and cultural assimilation that these marriages represented. The process likely involved investigation, confession, and possibly the dissolution of these marriages, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9-10</a>.<p><b>who had married foreign women</b><br>The issue of marrying foreign women was a significant concern for the post-exilic Jewish community. These marriages were seen as a violation of the Mosaic Law, which prohibited intermarriage with the surrounding nations to prevent the Israelites from being led astray into idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The foreign women mentioned here were likely from the surrounding pagan nations, and their presence posed a threat to the religious purity and identity of the Jewish people. This concern is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23-27</a>, where similar issues are addressed. The emphasis on separating from foreign influences can also be seen as a type of Christ, who calls His followers to be distinct and set apart from the world (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

Here, that timing underscores a decisive renewal for the returned exiles.<p>&#8226; Ezra&#8217;s leadership moved quickly; from the assembly in late Kislev (<a href="/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>) to this early-spring deadline shows urgency in restoring covenant faithfulness (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They had dealt with</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Dealt with&#8221; implies a thorough, orderly investigation, not a hasty purge.

The verse underscores prompt obedience, thorough justice, and unwavering commitment to God&#8217;s standards&#8212;principles still vital for believers who seek holy, undivided devotion to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They made an end with all the men</span>. They ran through the whole list of those who were accused of having taken strange wives, and adjudicated on every case, by <span class="cmt_word">the first day of the first month</span>, Nisan, corresponding nearly with our April. Deducting Sabbaths, the number of days in the three months would be seventy-five or seventy-six; but it is of course possible that the court did not sit continuously. THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAD MARRIED THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 18-44). Aware of the danger that the nation might relapse into the sin which he was seeking to root out, Ezra punishes the wrong-doers by placing their names on record, that others might fear to do the like. He assigns the first place in his catalogue of offenders to the priests, doubtless because in them the sin was greatest; they, as the special custodians of the Law, were most bound to have observed the Law. Next to the priests he puts the Levites, on the same principle, because of their semi-sacerdotal character. He then concludes with the laymen, arranged under their several families. By the list of laymen it appears that ten only out of some thirty-six lay families were implicated in the sin. Three of the four priestly families, on the other hand, and even the near-kindred of the high priest, were among the guilty. It is remarkable that it is Ezra, a priest, and one by many accused of over-sacerdotalism, who gives this testimony against his own order. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
