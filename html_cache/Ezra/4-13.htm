The context is a letter from adversaries of the Jews who were rebuilding Jerusalem. Such letters were common in the ancient Near East as a means of influencing royal policy. The phrase underscores the political tension and the use of diplomacy to halt the rebuilding efforts.<p><b>that if that city is rebuilt</b><br>The city in question is Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rebuilding of Jerusalem was a significant event for the Jewish people, symbolizing the restoration of their national and religious identity. The opponents feared that a rebuilt Jerusalem would become a center of power and rebellion against Persian rule.<p><b>and its walls are restored</b><br>Walls were crucial for the defense and autonomy of ancient cities. The restoration of Jerusalem's walls would signify not only physical security but also political independence. Nehemiah later undertakes this task, highlighting its importance in the narrative of Israel's restoration.<p><b>they will not pay tribute, duty, or toll</b><br>Tribute, duty, and toll were forms of taxation imposed by empires on their subject territories. The concern expressed here is economic; a fortified Jerusalem might resist paying these taxes, which were vital for the maintenance of the Persian Empire. This reflects the broader theme of economic control as a means of imperial dominance.<p><b>and the royal treasury will suffer</b><br>The mention of the royal treasury emphasizes the financial implications of the city's potential independence. The Persian Empire relied on the wealth of its provinces to sustain its vast bureaucracy and military. The letter's authors appeal to the king's economic interests, suggesting that a strong Jerusalem could disrupt the flow of resources to the empire.<br><br>This passage highlights the intersection of political, economic, and religious factors in the post-exilic period. It also foreshadows the challenges faced by the Jewish community in re-establishing their homeland, a theme that resonates throughout the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king to whom the letter is addressed, expressing concern over the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city in question, whose rebuilding is seen as a threat to the Persian Empire's control and revenue.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebuilders_of_jerusalem.htm">Rebuilders of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem with the intent to rebuild the city and the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries_of_judah_and_benjamin.htm">Adversaries of Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>The people who opposed the rebuilding efforts and wrote to the king to halt the progress.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persian_empire.htm">Persian Empire</a></b><br>The ruling empire at the time, under which the Jews were allowed to return to their homeland.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/opposition_to_god's_work.htm">Opposition to God's Work</a></b><br>Expect resistance when undertaking God's work.

By opening with &#8220;Let it now be known,&#8221; they frame their accusation as loyal counsel (<a href="/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>). Similar courtly language appears when Haman warns Ahasuerus about the Jews in <a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>. The tactic is intimidation by information: set the king on alert so he will intervene. <a href="/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a> shows the same strategy centuries later when accusers claim, &#8220;They are all acting contrary to Caesar&#8217;s decrees.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that if that city is rebuilt</b><p>The city in view is Jerusalem, long recognized as the center of Israel&#8217;s worship and identity (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1&#8211;3</a>). Rebuilding it would revive national life and covenant purpose, just as God promised through <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>. The adversaries treat this restoration as a political threat rather than a fulfillment of divine mandate (compare <a href="/1_kings/8-44.htm">1 Kings 8:44</a>, where Jerusalem&#8217;s divine choice is central). Their wording reveals fear that a restored Jerusalem would regain influence beyond mere bricks and mortar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its walls are restored</b><p>City walls in the ancient world meant security, autonomy, and military strength (<a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>). Without walls, a city is vulnerable (<a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>). By spotlighting the fortifications, the letter-makers suggest imminent rebellion, stoking the king&#8217;s fear of lost control. The irony is that God had already moved Cyrus to decree this rebuilding (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>), so opposing the walls is opposing the Lord&#8217;s clear directive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will not pay tribute, duty, or toll</b><p>Three kinds of tax are listed:<p>&#8226; Tribute &#8211; periodic assessments on subject peoples (<a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Duty &#8211; customs fees on goods (<a href="/nehemiah/5-4.htm">Nehemiah 5:4</a> hints at such burdens).<p>&#8226; Toll &#8211; road or transit taxes (<a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a> shows earlier examples).<p>The charge is that a fortified Jerusalem will refuse these payments. Yet <a href="/ezra/7-24.htm">Ezra 7:24</a> later exempts temple workers from exactly such taxes, showing God&#8217;s favor. Like the accusation against Jesus in <a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a> (&#8220;forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar&#8221;), this claim is more slander than reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the royal treasury will suffer.</b><p>The ultimate appeal is to the king&#8217;s pocketbook. Nabonidus Chronicles and other records show Persian rulers guarding revenue closely, so the threat seems plausible. <a href="/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a> notes that satraps were set &#8220;so that the king would not suffer loss,&#8221; echoing this very concern. The accusers know financial fear motivates swift imperial action. Still, the true Sovereign had already pledged to supply His house (<a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>), so earthly treasuries are secondary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-13.htm">Ezra 4:13</a> is a calculated warning meant to halt God&#8217;s rebuilding work by portraying Jerusalem as a fiscal and political danger. Each phrase piles up concern&#8212;first for royal awareness, then for potential rebellion, finally for lost revenue. The accusation twists truth, ignoring God&#8217;s command given through Cyrus and flaunted again through later decrees. The passage reminds believers that opposition often masks itself as prudent counsel, but the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand firm despite slander and fearmongering (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Toll, tribute, and custom.</span>--Toll for the highways; custom, a provision in kind; tribute, the money tax.<p><span class= "bld">The revenue.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">at length;</span> literally <span class= "ital">and at length damage will be done to the kings.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then will they not pay toll, tribute,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and custom.</span> This was plausible reasoning. In Greece, if a subject city set to work to fortify itself, rebellion was immediately anticipated, not unfairly. But the circumstances of the Persian empire were different. In the remoter parts of that empire the central government was weak, and disorders frequently occurred. A city might need fortifications to protect it against its immediate neighbours, when it had not the slightest intention of asserting independence. Judging from the later history, which shows no revolt of the Jews against Persia, we may say that the accusation now alleged was unfounded, though perhaps it was not made in bad faith. <span class="cmt_word">Toll</span>, <span class="cmt_word">tribute, and custom</span> represent the chief heads of Persian taxation, which, however, did not include "custom" in our sense of the word. The three terms used by the Samaritans really represent, respectively, "tribute," or the money payment required from each province, "provision," or the payment in kind equally required (Herod., 1:192; 3:91), and "toll," or contributions from those who made use of the Persian highways. According to the Samaritans, none of these would be paid by the Jews if Jerusalem was once fortified. <span class="cmt_word">And so thou shalt endamage the revenue.</span> The general meaning is given correctly enough by this rendering, but "revenue" is not expressly mentioned. <span class="accented">Aphthom</span>, the word so translated, means really "at length," "at last."
