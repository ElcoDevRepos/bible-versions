The phrase "set his heart" indicates a deliberate and resolute decision, reflecting a deep inner conviction. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which emphasizes guarding one's heart as the wellspring of life. Ezra's dedication is reminiscent of King David's heart for God, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, where David is described as a man after God's own heart.<p><b>to study the Law of the LORD</b><br>Ezra's focus on studying the Law underscores the importance of Scripture as the foundation of faith and practice. The "Law of the LORD" refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were central to Jewish life and worship. This dedication to study is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the blessed man delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night. Ezra's role as a scribe (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>) highlights his expertise and authority in interpreting the Scriptures.<p><b>to practice it</b><br>Ezra's commitment goes beyond mere academic study; he aims to live out the teachings of the Law. This practical application is crucial, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not hearers only. Ezra's life exemplifies the integration of faith and action, serving as a model for believers to follow. His practice of the Law would have been a powerful testimony to those around him, demonstrating the transformative power of God's Word.<p><b>and to teach its statutes and ordinances</b><br>Ezra's mission includes teaching, which is vital for the preservation and transmission of faith. The "statutes and ordinances" refer to the specific commands and decrees within the Law. Teaching is a key component of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructs His disciples to teach others to obey everything He has commanded. Ezra's role as a teacher aligns with the prophetic tradition, where leaders like Moses and the prophets instructed the people in God's ways.<p><b>in Israel</b><br>Ezra's work is set within the context of Israel, the covenant community chosen by God. His efforts to teach and reform the people occur during the post-exilic period, a time of rebuilding and renewal for the Jewish nation. This setting is significant, as it fulfills the prophetic promises of restoration found in books like Jeremiah and Isaiah. Ezra's leadership helps to reestablish the spiritual and communal identity of Israel, preparing the way for the coming of the Messiah, who would ultimately fulfill the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a key figure in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.

He wasn&#8217;t content with casual acquaintance; he aimed his inner compass toward God&#8217;s Word. Scripture often links spiritual resolve with God&#8217;s favor&#8212;think of Daniel who &#8220;set his heart to understand&#8221; and received swift angelic help (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>). Jehoshaphat &#8220;set his heart to seek God&#8221; and saw Judah spared (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>). <a href="/psalms/119-112.htm">Psalm 119:112</a> echoes the same idea: &#8220;I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever.&#8221; A firmly fixed heart is God&#8217;s starting point for revival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to study the Law of the LORD</b><p>Study here means prolonged, attentive digging. Ezra wanted to know exactly what God had said, not hearsay or tradition. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a> commanded Israel&#8217;s kings to copy the Law by hand and read it daily so they would &#8220;learn to fear the LORD.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a> depicts the blessed man whose &#8220;delight is in the Law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.&#8221; Paul urged Timothy, &#8220;Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>) and to &#8220;rightly handle the word of truth&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>). Ezra stands in the same stream of devoted learners.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to practice it</b><p>Head knowledge alone is barren; obedience proves belief. <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> links meditation with &#8220;doing everything written in it,&#8221; promising success. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> calls believers to be &#8220;doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221; Jesus said, &#8220;If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>). Ezra&#8217;s life matched his study; later, when he confronted mixed marriages (<a href="/bsb/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9&#8211;10</a>), he applied the very commands he had absorbed. True discipleship always moves from the page to the pavement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to teach its statutes and ordinances in Israel</b><p>Having learned and lived the Word, Ezra shared it. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> tells parents to teach God&#8217;s commands diligently to their children; <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a> says the priest&#8217;s lips &#8220;should preserve knowledge.&#8221; Ezra fulfilled both roles by reading the Law aloud, giving the sense, and helping people understand (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>). The Great Commission echoes this pattern: &#8220;teaching them to obey all I have commanded&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). An open Bible in a faithful teacher&#8217;s hands changes nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a> sketches a timeless chain: a heart set on God, a mind immersed in His Word, a life shaped by obedience, and a mouth ready to pass truth on.

First, he gave himself to study the law, then to practise it himself, and lastly to teach its positive statutes or ordinances and its moral judgments or precepts--a perfect description of a teacher in the congregation. There is nothing discordant in Ezra saying of himself that he had thus "set his heart."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Ezra had prepared his heart,</span> etc. God's favour towards Ezra, and the prosperous issue of his journey, were the consequences of his having set his heart on learning God's will, and doing it, and teaching it to others. <span class="cmt_word">To seek the law</span> is to aim at obtaining a complete knowledge of it. <span class="cmt_word">To teach statutes and judgments</span> is to inculcate both the ceremonial and the moral precepts.
