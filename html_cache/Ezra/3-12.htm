The older priests, Levites, and family heads had witnessed Solomon's Temple, a magnificent structure built around 957 BC, which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. Their memories of the grandeur of the first temple contrast sharply with the modest beginnings of the second temple's foundation. This reflects the historical context of the Jewish exile and return, emphasizing the loss and longing for the past glory of Israel. The mention of priests and Levites underscores the importance of religious leadership and continuity in Jewish worship practices.<p><b>wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this temple</b><br>The emotional response of weeping loudly indicates a deep sense of loss and disappointment. The foundation of the second temple, laid around 536 BC, was a significant event, yet it paled in comparison to the splendor of Solomon's Temple. This reaction can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a>, where the prophet questions who among them remembers the former glory and how they perceive the current state. The weeping also signifies a mourning for the past and a recognition of the consequences of Israel's disobedience that led to the exile.<p><b>Still, many others shouted joyfully</b><br>In contrast to the weeping, the joyful shouting represents hope and renewal. The younger generation and those who had not seen the first temple were filled with excitement and anticipation for the restoration of worship and community life in Jerusalem. This joy can be connected to the prophecies of restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>, which speak of the return from exile and the rebuilding of the temple. The mixed reactions highlight the complexity of human emotions in the face of change and the fulfillment of God's promises.
