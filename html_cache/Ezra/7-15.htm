The silver and gold symbolize not only material wealth but also the favor and support of the Persian king, Artaxerxes. This act of sending wealth aligns with the historical practice of kings supporting the restoration of temples and religious practices in their territories to maintain peace and loyalty among their subjects.<p><b>that the king and his counselors have freely offered</b><br>The voluntary nature of the offering underscores the king's respect for the God of Israel and his desire to support the Jewish people. This reflects the broader policy of the Persian Empire, which often allowed and even encouraged the restoration of local religious practices. The involvement of the king's counselors suggests a formal and official endorsement, indicating that this was not merely a personal gesture but a state-sanctioned act.<p><b>to the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the recognition of the God of Israel by a foreign king, which is significant in the biblical narrative. It demonstrates the influence and reach of the God of Israel beyond the Jewish people, fulfilling prophecies that nations would acknowledge Him. This acknowledgment by a Gentile king can be seen as a type of the future recognition of Christ by the nations.<p><b>whose dwelling is in Jerusalem</b><br>The reference to God's dwelling in Jerusalem emphasizes the centrality of the temple as the focal point of Jewish worship and identity. It also points to the historical and theological significance of Jerusalem as the city chosen by God.

The Persian king has already granted Ezra permission to return, and now he adds something extra&#8212;provision. Much like Cyrus before him (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a>) and Artaxerxes&#8217; later favor toward Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7-9</a>), God keeps moving pagan rulers to accomplish His purposes. <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD&#8230;He directs it like a watercourse wherever He pleases.&#8221; Every added word in the royal letter underscores the Lord&#8217;s ongoing, superintending care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to take with you</b><p>Responsibility lands squarely on Ezra. The priest-scribe is not a passive recipient; he must personally carry the resources. Earlier we&#8217;re told, &#8220;Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, to practice it, and to teach&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>). Now he must also transport treasure. Obedience usually involves motion: Abraham left Ur (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), the exiles left Babylon (<a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>), and believers are urged to &#8220;excel in this grace of giving&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>). God entrusts stewardship to real people on real roads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the silver and gold</b><p>The decree singles out precious metals&#8212;portable yet valuable, ideal for temple service (<a href="/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>). <a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a> declares, &#8220;The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine, says the LORD of Hosts.&#8221; By naming the elements, Scripture affirms that worship has material dimensions: altars, vessels, adornments. Generosity toward God&#8217;s house never surprises Him; He already owns the supply but invites His people&#8212;and here, even Gentile rulers&#8212;to participate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the king and his counselors have freely offered</b><p>These gifts are voluntary, not taxed. Centuries earlier, Israel built the tabernacle from &#8220;willing hearts&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>). Now Gentile officials echo that pattern. <a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8-10</a> had mandated imperial funding for sacrifices; chapter 7 shows an even freer endorsement. <a href="/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25-27</a> portrays another Persian monarch praising Israel&#8217;s God, and <a href="/acts/28-7.htm">Acts 28:7-10</a> records pagan kindness to Paul. The Lord repeatedly turns outsiders into supporters, reminding His people that He can raise up help from any quarter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the God of Israel</b><p>The decree directs offerings to a specific Recipient, not a generic deity. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> proclaims, &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One.&#8221; Artaxerxes&#8217; wording tacitly acknowledges the exclusivity of Israel&#8217;s covenant God. <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a> states, &#8220;Our God is in heaven; He does whatever pleases Him.&#8221; By naming Him, the king distances these funds from idolatrous purposes and aligns them with true worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose dwelling is in Jerusalem</b><p>God had chosen Zion for His earthly habitation (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). While He is omnipresent, He localized His glory in the temple&#8212;a tangible center for covenant life. This phrase roots the decree in history: real gold traveling to a real city for a real sanctuary. Yet it also looks ahead. <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> tells us the Word &#8220;tabernacled&#8221; among us, and <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a> says believers are now God&#8217;s temple. The Jerusalem sanctuary was a shadow; Christ and His Church are the fuller reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/7-15.htm">Ezra 7:15</a> shows God orchestrating political authority, personal obedience, material provision, voluntary generosity, covenant fidelity, and sacred location&#8212;all converging so His name may be honored. The verse encourages us that every resource, every willing heart, and every earthly ruler ultimately serves the God whose dwelling, glory, and purposes remain unshakeable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to carry</span> <span class="cmt_word">the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered.</span> Large sums in specie had in ancient times to be remitted from one country to another <span class="accented">under escort</span>.
