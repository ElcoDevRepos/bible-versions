In ancient Near Eastern cultures, letters from kings were considered binding and carried significant weight. Such documents were often preserved and read publicly to ensure compliance and transparency.<p><b>King Artaxerxes</b><br>Artaxerxes I was a Persian king who reigned from 465 to 424 BC. His reign is noted for its relative stability and for the continuation of policies that allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple. The mention of Artaxerxes highlights the historical context of the Persian Empire's influence over the Jewish people during this period.<p><b>had given to Ezra</b><br>Ezra, a key figure in Jewish history, was a priest and scribe who played a crucial role in the spiritual and social restoration of Jerusalem. The fact that Artaxerxes gave this letter to Ezra underscores the king's trust in him and the divine favor upon Ezra's mission. This also reflects the Persian policy of supporting local religious practices to maintain peace in their vast empire.<p><b>the priest and scribe</b><br>Ezra's dual role as both priest and scribe is significant. As a priest, he was responsible for religious duties and maintaining the spiritual purity of the people. As a scribe, he was an expert in the Law of Moses, tasked with teaching and interpreting the Scriptures. This combination of roles made him uniquely qualified to lead the Jewish community in religious reform.<p><b>an expert in the commandments and statutes of the LORD</b><br>Ezra's expertise in the commandments and statutes signifies his deep understanding and commitment to the Mosaic Law. This expertise was crucial for the re-establishment of Jewish identity and religious practices in Jerusalem. It also highlights the importance of adherence to God's law as a foundation for the community's covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>to Israel</b><br>The reference to Israel emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with His people, despite their exile and dispersion. It serves as a reminder of their identity as God's chosen people and their obligation to live according to His commandments. This phrase also connects Ezra's mission to the broader narrative of Israel's history and God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A priest and scribe, Ezra was a learned man in the Law of Moses.
