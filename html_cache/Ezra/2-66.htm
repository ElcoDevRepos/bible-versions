Horses were valuable assets for travel and communication, especially during the return from Babylonian exile. In biblical history, horses are often associated with strength and power, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the name of the Lord. The specific number, 736, indicates a substantial resource for the returning exiles, suggesting a well-prepared and organized group. This reflects the providence and blessing of God in providing for their needs as they undertook the journey back to Jerusalem.<p><b>245 mules</b><br>Mules, being hybrids of horses and donkeys, were prized for their endurance and ability to carry heavy loads over long distances. Their inclusion in the inventory of returning exiles underscores the practical needs of the journey and the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem. Mules were less common than horses, which is reflected in the smaller number, 245. This detail highlights the logistical planning involved in the return from exile, as mules would have been essential for transporting goods and supplies. In a broader biblical context, mules are mentioned in various passages, such as <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>, where Absalom rides a mule, indicating their use by people of status. The presence of mules among the exiles suggests a community prepared for the challenges of re-establishing their homeland.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon.

God values specifics. The same Lord who counted Abraham&#8217;s stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>) and numbered Israel&#8217;s warriors in <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2&#8211;3</a> also counts animals here.<p>&#8226; Precise numbers certify the historicity of the return, just as the census lists in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1&#8211;63</a> do for people.<p>&#8226; Tangible resources show God&#8217;s provision. Cyrus had ordered the temple vessels returned (<a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7&#8211;11</a>); now we see the livestock He also supplied.<p>&#8226; The record is modest: fewer animals than Israel&#8217;s kings once kept (<a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>), yet enough for the journey and the rebuilding task ahead&#8212;proof that &#8220;My God will supply all your needs&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>Cross references woven in: <a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21&#8211;23</a> (seeking safe travel), <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a> (parallel list), <a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a> (He counts the stars, calls them all by name).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>736 horses</b><p>Horses were the &#8220;engines&#8221; of the ancient world&#8212;fast, powerful, and costly.

This little herd testifies that the remnant returns in humility, not military might.<p>&#8226; The number still matters: horses pulled carts of temple articles, carried leaders like Zerubbabel, and enabled quick messengers (<a href="/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture balances caution and thanksgiving: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The remnant had horses, yet their ultimate confidence stayed in the Lord.<p>Additional cross references: <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a> (The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD); <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a> (Not by might nor by power).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>245 mules</b><p>Mules&#8212;sturdy hybrids&#8212;were valued for endurance more than speed.

A small number here underscores servant leadership.<p>&#8226; The mixture of horses and mules models balanced stewardship: using what God provides without excess (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>Further cross references: <a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a> (Ahab and Obadiah searching for grass for mules); <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12&#8211;15</a> (night inspection of Jerusalem&#8217;s walls, likely with pack animals).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/2-66.htm">Ezra 2:66</a>, with its precise tally of 736 horses and 245 mules, is more than a travel ledger.
