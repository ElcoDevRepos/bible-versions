Ezra, a scribe and priest, was instrumental in the spiritual and religious reform of the Jewish people. His journey from Babylon to Jerusalem was approximately 900 miles and took about four months, highlighting his dedication and the importance of his mission. This event is a fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people to their land after the Babylonian exile, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>.<p><b>in the fifth month</b><br>The fifth month in the Hebrew calendar is Av, which typically falls around July or August in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it coincides with the period of mourning for the destruction of the First Temple, which occurred on the ninth of Av. Ezra's arrival during this month symbolizes a time of renewal and hope for the Jewish people, as he brings with him the authority to teach and enforce the Law of Moses.<p><b>of the seventh year of the king</b><br>The king referred to here is Artaxerxes I of Persia, who reigned from 465 to 424 BC. The seventh year of his reign would be around 458 BC. Artaxerxes' support of Ezra's mission, as seen in the decree allowing him to return to Jerusalem, reflects the favorable disposition of the Persian rulers towards the Jewish people during this period. This support is reminiscent of the earlier decree by Cyrus the Great, which allowed the initial return of the exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a key figure in the restoration of Jerusalem and the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile.

This was no doubt viewed as an auspicious day for beginning an important undertaking. The time occupied on the way was exactly four months, which is longer than might have been supposed to be necessary. Herodotus reckoned it a three months journey from Sardis to Susa (ver. 53), and the younger Cyrus conducted an army from Ephesus to Cunaxa, near Babylon, in ninety- three marching days (Xen, 'Anab' 2 1, &sect; 6) - the distance in either case being considerably more than that from Babylon to Jerusalem, even supposing the route followed to have been by Balis and Aleppo. But a caravan, like an army, requires rests; and we hear of one such rest at Ahava (<a href="/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>). Cyrus gave his troops more days of rest than of movement, and took half the year to reach Cunaxa from Ephesus. We need not be surprised, therefore, that Ezra's journey occupied four months. Some delay must almost certainly have been caused by the perils of the route (see <a href="/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ezra arrived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1430;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the fifth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2549.htm">Strong's 2549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifth, a fifth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">month</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1465;&#1443;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7695;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2320.htm">Strong's 2320: </a> </span><span class="str2">The new moon, a month</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7637.htm">Strong's 7637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventh (an ordinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the king.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/7-8.htm">OT History: Ezra 7:8 He came to Jerusalem in the fifth (Ezr.
