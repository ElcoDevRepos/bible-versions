Jerusalem is often referred to as the city of God, and it holds significant importance as the location of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence on earth. The directive to deliver to the "God of Jerusalem" underscores the recognition of Yahweh as the one true God, distinct from the gods of surrounding nations. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where Jerusalem is the chosen city for His name to dwell (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). The phrase also highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands, as Ezra is tasked with fulfilling a divine mandate.<p><b>all the articles given to you</b><br>The "articles" refer to the sacred vessels and items used in the worship and service of the Temple. These articles were essential for the proper conduct of religious rituals and sacrifices. Historically, these items had been taken to Babylon during the exile (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>), and their return signifies the restoration of proper worship practices. The mention of these articles also connects to the broader theme of restoration and renewal found in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, as the Jewish people return from exile and reestablish their religious identity.<p><b>for the service of the house of your God</b><br>The "house of your God" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was the center of Jewish worship and sacrificial system. The service of the Temple was a critical aspect of maintaining the covenant relationship with God, as it involved offerings, sacrifices, and rituals prescribed in the Law of Moses. This phrase underscores the importance of the Temple as the place where God meets with His people and where atonement for sin is made. The restoration of the Temple service is a key theme in Ezra, symbolizing the renewal of the covenant and the people's commitment to live according to God's laws. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of the Temple's purpose in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells fully and where the ultimate sacrifice for sin is made.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.
