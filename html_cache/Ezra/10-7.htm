The use of "proclamation" suggests a formal and authoritative command, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. Historically, proclamations were often delivered by messengers or heralds who traveled to various towns and villages. The mention of "Judah and Jerusalem" highlights the geographical scope of the announcement, covering both the rural areas of Judah and the central city of Jerusalem, which was the religious and political heart of the Jewish people. This reflects the post-exilic period when the Jewish community was re-establishing itself in the land after the Babylonian captivity.<p><b>that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem</b><br>The call for "all the exiles" to gather underscores the inclusive nature of the assembly, inviting every member of the community who had returned from Babylonian exile. This gathering was crucial for addressing the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, which was seen as a threat to the religious purity and identity of the Jewish people. Jerusalem, being the spiritual center, was the appropriate place for such a significant assembly. The gathering at Jerusalem also echoes earlier biblical events, such as the assembly at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites received the Law. This connection emphasizes the covenantal renewal and the need for communal repentance and reform. The gathering can also be seen as a type of the future gathering of God's people, as prophesied in various scriptures, pointing to a time of restoration and unity under God's rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon.
