Rehum, likely a high-ranking officer, and Shimshai, a scribe, represent the bureaucratic structure of the Persian Empire, which was known for its efficient administration. Their roles suggest they had significant influence and authority in the region. The mention of these officials highlights the organized opposition faced by the Jewish people during the rebuilding of Jerusalem. This opposition is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, as seen in other parts of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>wrote the letter against Jerusalem</b><br>The act of writing a letter indicates the formal and legal approach taken by the adversaries of the Jews. This reflects the Persian Empire's reliance on written communication and decrees to manage its vast territories. The letter's purpose was to halt the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem, which the local officials viewed as a threat to their power and influence. This opposition is reminiscent of the challenges faced by God's people throughout history, where external forces often attempt to thwart divine plans.<p><b>to King Artaxerxes</b><br>Artaxerxes I was the king of Persia from 465 to 424 BC. His reign is marked by various administrative reforms and interactions with the Jewish community. The mention of Artaxerxes connects this narrative to the broader historical context of the Persian Empire's rule over Judah. The king's involvement underscores the political complexities of the time, as local disputes often required intervention from the central authority. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over earthly rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>.<p><b>as follows:</b><br>The phrase introduces the content of the letter, setting the stage for the detailed accusations against the Jews. This introduction emphasizes the formal nature of the communication and the seriousness of the charges. The letter's content, which follows in subsequent verses, reveals the tactics used by the adversaries to manipulate political power against the Jewish community. This mirrors the spiritual battles faced by believers, where accusations and opposition are common, as seen in <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehum_the_commander.htm">Rehum the Commander</a></b><br>A high-ranking official who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem.

The term &#8220;commander&#8221; tells us he was a Persian official entrusted with regional control, so his words carried governmental weight (cf. <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Opposition to God&#8217;s work often begins with people in power; we see the same pattern in Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>) and later in the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/5-27.htm">Acts 5:27&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; His title reminds us that resistance to rebuilding the temple is not random&#8212;there is organized, strategic pressure whenever God&#8217;s people advance (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Shimshai the scribe</b><p>&#8226; Shimshai, as &#8220;scribe,&#8221; handled official documentation. The pairing of military might with bureaucratic skill shows a coordinated front, blending force and paperwork (cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>, where Assyrian envoys combine soldiers and scribes).<p>&#8226; A scribe&#8217;s involvement highlights the importance of records in Persian governance (<a href="/ezra/5-17.htm">Ezra 5:17</a>). This also foreshadows how God will later use Persian archives to defend His people (<a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture frequently records adversaries who twist paperwork to hinder God&#8217;s plans&#8212;see letters written against Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-24.htm">Jeremiah 29:24&#8211;32</a>) and the accusations in <a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wrote the letter</b><p>&#8226; The opposition moves from talk to action. A formal letter carries legal repercussions, aiming to halt construction through official decree (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/6-5.htm">Nehemiah 6:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people must often defend their work in writing&#8212;Mordecai drafts a counter-edict in <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>; Paul writes letters defending the gospel (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4</a> reminds believers that administrative barriers can be as daunting as physical attack, yet God remains sovereign over paperwork and kings alike (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Their target is explicitly &#8220;against Jerusalem,&#8221; not merely against Zerubbabel or a political faction. The holy city represents God&#8217;s presence and promises (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Opposition to Jerusalem surfaces throughout Scripture: Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10&#8211;13</a>), Sanballat (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1&#8211;3</a>), and in the end times, the nations gather against it (<a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase shows spiritual warfare at work&#8212;by hindering Jerusalem&#8217;s restoration, the enemy hopes to undermine God&#8217;s covenant purposes (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to King Artaxerxes</b><p>&#8226; Appealing to the king highlights the hierarchy: earthly rulers can be swayed, but God alone is ultimate King (<a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Artaxerxes likely refers to Artaxerxes I (465&#8211;424 BC). Scripture notes his openness to God&#8217;s influence when Nehemiah later seeks permission to rebuild walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1&#8211;8</a>), proving God can turn any heart.<p>&#8226; The letter&#8217;s destination stresses that decisions made in distant palaces can impact local ministry, reminding us to pray &#8220;for kings and all in authority&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as follows</b><p>&#8226; The phrase sets the stage for the detailed accusation that fills verses 9&#8211;16. It signals transparency in Scripture&#8217;s narrative: God lets us read the enemy&#8217;s playbook so we&#8217;re not ignorant of his schemes (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the exact wording, the Bible shows its historical reliability; future generations can trace God&#8217;s deliverance step by step (<a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; This introduction also invites the reader to weigh the charges against God&#8217;s people, anticipating the divine rebuttal that will come through further decrees (<a href="/ezra/6-6.htm">Ezra 6:6&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> captures the moment organized opposition crystallizes: a military governor (Rehum) and a skilled bureaucrat (Shimshai) draft an official letter to King Artaxerxes, aiming to stop Jerusalem&#8217;s rebuilding.
