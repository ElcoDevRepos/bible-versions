His role is often associated with Zerubbabel, another key figure in the rebuilding of the temple. Some scholars suggest Sheshbazzar might be a Babylonian name for Zerubbabel or a separate individual who initially led the return. His coming signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people back to their land, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>.<p><b>and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem</b><br>The laying of the foundation marks a significant event in the restoration of worship and the re-establishment of the Jewish community in Jerusalem. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God declares that Cyrus will decree the rebuilding of the temple. The foundation laying is a physical and spiritual renewal, symbolizing a new beginning for the Israelites after their exile.<p><b>and from that time until now it has been under construction</b><br>The construction of the temple faced numerous challenges, including opposition from surrounding peoples and internal discouragement. This period of construction reflects the perseverance required to fulfill God's purposes amidst adversity. The ongoing work is a testament to the faith and determination of the Jewish people to restore their place of worship, as seen in the books of Haggai and Zechariah, which encourage the people to continue building.<p><b>but it has not yet been completed.</b><br>The incomplete state of the temple highlights the obstacles and delays encountered during its construction. This phrase underscores the theme of waiting and trusting in God's timing. The delay also serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual readiness and commitment to God's work. The eventual completion of the temple, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/6.htm">Ezra 6</a>, signifies God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, prefiguring the ultimate completion of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheshbazzar.htm">Sheshbazzar</a></b><br>He is identified as the governor who laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem.
