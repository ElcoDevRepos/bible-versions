The "eye of their God" suggests God's watchful care and providence over His people, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). The "elders of the Jews" refers to the leaders responsible for guiding the community in rebuilding the temple. This divine oversight reassures the faithful that God is actively involved in their endeavors, echoing His promises to Israel in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>.<p><b>so that they were not stopped</b><br>Despite opposition from local adversaries, the rebuilding efforts continued. This phrase highlights God's intervention in ensuring the work progressed. Historically, the Jews faced significant resistance from surrounding peoples who were threatened by the re-establishment of Jerusalem (<a href="/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>). The continuation of the work despite these challenges underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and protection.<p><b>until a report was sent to Darius</b><br>Darius I, the Persian king, reigned from 522-486 BC. The report sent to him was a formal complaint by the adversaries of the Jews, seeking to halt the construction. This reflects the bureaucratic processes of the Persian Empire, where local disputes were often escalated to the central authority. The mention of Darius connects this narrative to the broader historical context of the Persian period, during which the Jews were allowed to return and rebuild their temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p><b>and written instructions about this matter were returned</b><br>The return of written instructions signifies the importance of royal decrees in the Persian administration. The Jews awaited a response that would determine the legality of their actions. This reflects the reliance on written documentation for governance and legal matters in the ancient Near East. The eventual favorable response from Darius (<a href="/ezra/6.htm">Ezra 6:1-12</a>) can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to support His people, aligning with prophecies of restoration found in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eye_of_god.htm">The Eye of God</a></b><br>This phrase signifies God's watchful care and protection over His people.
