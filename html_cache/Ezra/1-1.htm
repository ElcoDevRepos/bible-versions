Cyrus is noted for his policy of religious tolerance and his decree allowing exiled peoples to return to their homelands. This aligns with historical records, such as the Cyrus Cylinder, which corroborates his approach to governance. His reign is pivotal in biblical history as it marks the end of the Babylonian captivity for the Jews.<p><b>to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah</b><br>This refers to the prophecy found in <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12 and 29</a>:10, where Jeremiah foretold that the Babylonian exile would last seventy years. The return of the Jews to Jerusalem under Cyrus's decree is seen as the fulfillment of this prophecy, demonstrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises. This fulfillment underscores the reliability of prophetic scripture and God's control over historical events.<p><b>the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia</b><br>This indicates divine intervention, where God influences the heart of a pagan king to accomplish His purposes. It highlights the theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the LORD. This stirring of Cyrus's spirit is a testament to God's ability to use even those outside the covenant community to fulfill His divine plans.<p><b>to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom</b><br>Cyrus's decree was not only a political act but also a fulfillment of divine prophecy. The proclamation was sent throughout the vast Persian Empire, which stretched from the Indus Valley to the Aegean Sea, ensuring that all exiled peoples, including the Jews, were aware of their opportunity to return home. This widespread announcement reflects the extensive reach and influence of the Persian Empire at the time.<p><b>and to put it in writing as follows:</b><br>The act of putting the proclamation in writing signifies its official and binding nature. Written decrees were a common practice in the ancient Near East to ensure the permanence and authority of royal commands. This written decree aligns with the biblical emphasis on the importance of written records, as seen in other parts of scripture, such as the Ten Commandments and the Book of the Law. It also serves as a historical document that validates the biblical narrative of the return from exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus_king_of_persia.htm">Cyrus King of Persia</a></b><br>The ruler of the Persian Empire who issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

THE FIRST RETURN UNDER ZERUBBABEL.</span><p>(1-4) The decree of Cyrus: marking an epoch of very great importance, and therefore repeated almost word for word from the end of Chronicles.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The first year.</span>--Cyrus became king of Persia in B.C. 559. Twenty years afterwards he took Babylon from Belshazzar; and this first year of his rule in Babylon was his beginning as an agent in Jewish affairs and for the Kingdom of God.<p><span class= "bld">Stirred up.</span>--By a direct influence, probably through the instrumentality of Daniel. This prophet we may suppose Cyrus to have found in Babylon, and to have had his mind directed to the express prediction of <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where his name is mentioned. But the writer, who again and again records the prophetic intervention of Haggai and Zechariah (<a href="/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-14.htm" title="And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.">Ezra 6:14</a>), makes no allusion to the part that Daniel the earlier prophet had taken. He refers only to the Divine prediction by Jeremiah, which must be fulfilled: "And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon" ( <a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, said the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:12</a>); "For thus saith the Lord, that after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place" (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Cyrus.</span> The context shows that it is the first year of Cyrus <span class="accented">at Babylon</span> which is intended. Cyrus the Great became King of Persia by his final defeat and capture of Astyages, in <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> probably. His conquest of Babylon was, comparatively speaking, late in his reign (Herod., Xenoph.), and is fixed by the Canon of Ptolemy to <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He took the city on the night of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>), when Daniel had just been appointed to the third place in the kingdom (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29), and was practically at the head of affairs. Thus the great king and the great prophet of the time were brought into contact, and naturally conferred together, as may be gathered from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by</span> <span class="cmt_word">the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled</span>. The reference is to <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>, and Jeremiah 29:10. Jeremiah had prophesied not only the fact, but the date of the return, by assigning to the captivity a duration of "seventy years." There might be some doubt when exactly this term would run out, since the year of 360 was in prophetic use no less than the year of 365 days ('Dict. of the Bible,' s.v. YEAR), and, moreover, the exact date of the commencement of the captivity admitted of question; but Daniel appears to have calculated in <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> that the term was approaching its termination (see <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-19</a>). If the captivity were regarded as commencing in the third year of Jehoiakim (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1, 2</a>), which was <span class="date">B.C. 606-605</span>, and if years of 360 days were regarded as intended, this would clearly be so, since 360 x 70 = 25,200, and 365 &times; 68 = 24,820, so that in <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> only another year was wanting. For the prophecy to be fulfilled, it was requisite that the first steps towards bringing about the return and the cessation of desolation should not be delayed beyond the close of <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span>, accordingly, in this year <span class="cmt_word">stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia</span>. As God in earlier times had worked on the minds of Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) and Balaam (<a href="/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5, 16</a>), and more recently of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>), so now, it would seem, he directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus. This is the less surprising, as Cyrus was, in the Divine counsels, fore-ordained to do this work, and had been raised to his high station for the purpose (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4</a>). Cyrus was thus induced to make a <span class="cmt_word">proclamation</span> (literally, "to make to pass a voice") throughout the whole kingdom, which reached from the AEgean Sea to the borders of India, and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, and even to <span class="cmt_word">put it in writing</span>, <span class="accented">b</span> <span class="accented">miktab</span>, that so it might be sure to become generally known. Writing was probably of recent introduction into Persia; but there is positive evidence in the native remains of its use by Cyrus. His proclamation was probably issued in at least two languages, Persian and Chaldee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1431;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;i&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
