This title emphasizes His dominion over all creation, a common theme in the post-exilic period when the Jews were under foreign rule. The acknowledgment of God's commands reflects the Jewish understanding of divine law as paramount, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a>, where adherence to God's commandments is central to Jewish life and identity.<p><b>must be done diligently</b><br>The call for diligence underscores the importance of careful and faithful execution of God's commands. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>, which encourages doing one's work with all one's might. The historical context here is significant, as the Jews were returning from exile and rebuilding the temple, requiring meticulous adherence to God's instructions to ensure His favor and presence.<p><b>for His house</b><br>"His house" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Jewish people. The temple was not only a physical structure but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. The rebuilding of the temple was a fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God declares that Cyrus will decree the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. The temple's significance is further highlighted in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), drawing a typological connection between the physical temple and Christ Himself.<p><b>For why should wrath fall on the realm of the king and his sons?</b><br>This phrase reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the divine right of kings and the idea that the favor or wrath of a deity could impact a ruler's reign and dynasty. In the context of Ezra, King Artaxerxes of Persia is concerned about maintaining peace and prosperity in his realm, recognizing that neglecting the God of Israel's commands could bring divine retribution. This mirrors the biblical theme of divine judgment and blessing based on obedience, as seen in the covenantal blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The concern for the king's sons also highlights the dynastic implications of divine favor, a concept seen throughout the Old Testament in the narratives of Israel's kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

We can trust that God is in control, even in political and global affairs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>The concern for God's wrath reflects a healthy fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom.

Egypt had revolted from the Persians in <span class="date">B.C. 460</span>, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of <span class="date">B.C. 459</span>, to force Athens to recall her troops. In <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his <span class="accented">firman</span> to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past "wrath," shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in <span class="date">B.C. 455</span> the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. <span class="cmt_word">The king and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> This mention of the "sons" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/7-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whatever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3606.htm">Strong's 3606: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;a&#183;&#8216;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2941.htm">Strong's 2941: </a> </span><span class="str2">Account, to be commanded, commandment, matter </span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_426.htm">Strong's 426: </a> </span><span class="str2">God</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of heaven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;may&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8065.htm">Strong's 8065: </a> </span><span class="str2">The sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">must be done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5648.htm">Strong's 5648: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make, prepare, keep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">diligently</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7695;&#183;raz&#183;d&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_149.htm">Strong's 149: </a> </span><span class="str2">Quickly, carefully</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the [His] house.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
