In the context of Ezra, this refers to the decree issued by King Cyrus of Persia. The instruction highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people and their worship in Jerusalem, as prophesied by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Take these articles</b><br>The articles refer to the sacred vessels and items that were taken from the temple in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian conquest (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-15</a>). Their return signifies the restoration of proper worship and the continuity of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty over history, as He orchestrates the return of these items through a foreign king.<p><b>put them in the temple in Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the specific location where the articles are to be placed, highlighting Jerusalem's central role in Jewish worship and identity. The temple in Jerusalem was the designated place for God's presence among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The return of the articles to the temple signifies the reestablishment of the sacrificial system and the renewal of the covenant community.<p><b>and let the house of God be rebuilt</b><br>The rebuilding of the temple is a central theme in the book of Ezra. It represents not only the physical restoration of a building but also the spiritual renewal of the people of Israel. The temple is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The rebuilding foreshadows the coming of Jesus, who would establish a new covenant and a spiritual temple made up of believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><b>on its original site</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of continuity and faithfulness to God's original plan. The original site of the temple, Mount Moriah, is significant in biblical history as the location where Abraham was willing to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>) and where Solomon built the first temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>).
