This period is also associated with the Passover, a time of deliverance and new beginnings, echoing the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. The twelfth day suggests a period of preparation and consecration before embarking on the journey.<p><b>we set out from the Ahava Canal</b><br>The Ahava Canal is likely a waterway or region in Babylon, where Ezra gathered the exiles. This location served as a staging area for the journey back to Jerusalem. The mention of a canal indicates the presence of irrigation and trade routes, highlighting the logistical considerations of the journey. It also reflects the organized nature of the return under Ezra's leadership.<p><b>to go to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of the Jewish people, was the destination of the exiles. This journey symbolizes a return to the covenantal promises and the restoration of worship in the temple. Jerusalem holds prophetic significance as the city of God, and its restoration is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, pointing to future messianic fulfillment.<p><b>and the hand of our God was upon us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes divine providence and protection. The "hand of God" is a biblical motif signifying God's power, guidance, and favor. It reassures the exiles of God's presence and support, echoing the experiences of their ancestors during the Exodus. This divine assistance is crucial for the success of their mission.<p><b>to protect us from the hands of the enemies and bandits along the way</b><br>The journey from Babylon to Jerusalem was fraught with danger, including threats from hostile groups and robbers. This protection underscores God's sovereignty and faithfulness in safeguarding His people. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a protector and deliverer, as seen in Psalms and other historical narratives.

He "trusted in God," and was "delivered" - how delivered we are not told, but evidently through no "arm of flesh." The hand of God led him safely through all the perils of the way, and brought him and his companions without loss or damage to the "city of their rest." EZRA'S THREE DAYS' REST AT JERUSALEM, AND SUBSEQUENT EXECUTION OF THE MORE PRESSING OF THE COMMISSIONS INTRUSTED TO HIM (<a href="/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32-36</a>). After the fatigues of a four months' journey, a brief period of complete rest was well-nigh necessary. Like Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11</a>), Ezra was content with a rest of three days. On the fourth he discharged himself of his commission to present to the temple treasury the offerings of the Persian king, his counsellors and lords (ver. 25), together with that spontaneously contributed by the Israelites who had accompanied him (<a href="/ezra/7-16.htm">Ezra 7:16</a>). This he did by appearing in person before the priests and Levites who were in charge of the temple, and making over to them the entire offering of gold, silver, and vessels which had been brought to Jerusalem from Babylon. At the same time the exiles whom he had induced to return, and whom he had conducted in safety through so long a journey, sacrificed on the altar of burnt offerings a number of bullocks, rams, lambs, and he-goats, as a token of their thankfulness to God for delivering them from the perils of the way. After this Ezra proceeded to make known to the satraps and other governors of the provinces lying west of the Euphrates the terms of the permanent commission which he had received from the king. The result was that these officials thenceforth helped the Jews instead of hindering them, and furnished the necessary supplies for the temple service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the twelfth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;n&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
