In the context of Ezra, the returning exiles were set apart for a divine purpose, similar to the priests and Levites who were consecrated for service in the temple (<a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>). Holiness in the Old Testament often denotes being set apart for God's service, reflecting God's own holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This consecration underscores the importance of purity and dedication in fulfilling God's commands.<p><b>and these articles are holy.</b><br>The articles referred to are the vessels and items intended for use in the temple. These items were considered sacred because they were dedicated to the service of God. In the broader biblical context, the holiness of objects used in worship is a recurring theme, as seen with the tabernacle furnishings (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>). The sanctity of these articles underscores the reverence required in handling things dedicated to God.<p><b>The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD,</b><br>The silver and gold mentioned here were contributions from the Jewish community and possibly from the Persian king, intended to support the temple's restoration. A freewill offering, as described in <a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18-23</a>, is a voluntary act of worship, reflecting the giver's devotion and gratitude. This offering highlights the communal effort and sacrifice involved in the rebuilding of the temple, a central place of worship and identity for the Jewish people.<p><b>the God of your fathers.</b><br>This phrase connects the present generation with their ancestors, emphasizing continuity in worship and covenant relationship with God. It recalls the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;who were foundational figures in Israel's history and faith (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).
