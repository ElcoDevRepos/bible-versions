The arrival in Jerusalem signifies the fulfillment of a mission that began with a decree from King Artaxerxes of Persia (<a href="/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11-26</a>). This journey was not merely a physical relocation but a spiritual pilgrimage, reflecting the return of the Jewish exiles to their ancestral homeland. Jerusalem, the city of David, holds profound religious significance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. The return to Jerusalem can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to restore His people, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>. This journey also prefigures the ultimate return and restoration that believers anticipate in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<p><b>and rested there for three days.</b><br>The mention of resting for three days is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a period of preparation, transition, or completion. In this context, the rest likely served as a time for physical recuperation after the long and arduous journey from Babylon, which took several months. It also provided an opportunity for spiritual reflection and preparation before undertaking the tasks that lay ahead, such as the distribution of offerings and the reestablishment of proper worship practices. The number three is frequently associated with divine completeness and resurrection, as seen in the three days between Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). This period of rest could symbolize a new beginning for the exiles, akin to a resurrection of their national and spiritual identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
