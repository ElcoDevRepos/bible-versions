The first day of the first month, Nisan, is significant in the Jewish calendar as it marks the beginning of the religious year and is associated with the Passover, a time of deliverance and new beginnings. This timing underscores the theme of redemption and restoration. Babylon, where the Jews had been in exile, was a center of learning and culture, but also a place of captivity. Ezra's departure from Babylon symbolizes a spiritual and physical return to God's promises.<p><b>and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month</b><br>The journey from Babylon to Jerusalem took approximately four months, covering a distance of about 900 miles. This was a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning and divine protection. The arrival in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, Av, is noteworthy as it precedes the month of Elul, a time of preparation for the High Holy Days. Jerusalem, the spiritual center of the Jewish faith, represents the fulfillment of God's promises and the restoration of worship. The successful completion of this journey highlights God's faithfulness and the importance of Jerusalem in His divine plan.<p><b>for the gracious hand of his God was upon him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine favor and guidance that Ezra experienced throughout his journey. The "gracious hand" of God indicates His providence, protection, and blessing. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's hand is often associated with deliverance and empowerment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>). Ezra's successful journey and mission are attributed not to his own abilities but to God's intervention. This reflects the biblical principle that God's purposes are accomplished through His chosen servants by His grace and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Ezra is not pondering obedience; he is acting on it (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>).<p>- Babylon represents both the literal place of exile and the spiritual environment Israel longed to leave (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>).<p>- God had already stirred earlier exiles to return (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>), and now Ezra embraces the same call, showing continuity in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>).<p>- This departure underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness to His promise that exile would not be permanent (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the first day of the first month</b><p>- The first month (Nisan/Abib) begins Israel&#8217;s religious calendar (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). Beginning the journey then signals a fresh start, aligned with Passover themes of redemption.<p>- Ezra&#8217;s timing was precise and deliberate, reflecting orderly obedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>- The journey launched during a season of hopeful anticipation&#8212;much like Israel&#8217;s original exodus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he arrived in Jerusalem</b><p>- Four months later, the caravan stands in God&#8217;s chosen city (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a> &#8211; 14).<p>- Jerusalem is more than geography; it is the covenant center where God set His Name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>- Ezra&#8217;s purpose&#8212;teaching God&#8217;s Law (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>)&#8212;could only be fulfilled where worship and sacrifice were restored (<a href="/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a> &#8211; 18).<p>- The arrival underscores restoration: people, Law, and land reunited under God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the first day of the fifth month</b><p>- Roughly nine hundred miles on foot required perseverance and protection (<a href="/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>).<p>- The specific dating verifies historical reliability and invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s sustained care through daily travel (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p>- Four months mirror Israel&#8217;s earlier wilderness journeys, reminding readers that God guides across all distances (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the gracious hand of his God was upon him</b><p>- Ezra attributes success entirely to divine favor, not human strategy (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>; 8:18, 22).<p>- &#8220;Hand&#8221; pictures God&#8217;s active involvement&#8212;guiding, shielding, supplying (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p>- Grace defines the return: God moved Persian kings to fund the trip (<a href="/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a> &#8211; 24) and guarded travelers from enemies (<a href="/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>).<p>- The phrase invites trust that the same gracious hand still directs His people (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a> is a compact testimony of God&#8217;s faithfulness. The verse tracks a real journey&#8212;departing Babylon at the dawn of the year, reaching Jerusalem in midsummer&#8212;and credits every mile to God&#8217;s gracious hand.
