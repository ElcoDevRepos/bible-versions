The term "assembly" is often used in the Old Testament to describe the gathered people of Israel, emphasizing their unity and shared purpose.

In this context, it underscores the importance of each individual in the community and the careful record-keeping that was part of re-establishing the nation. It also reflects the biblical theme of God knowing and valuing each member of His people.<p><b>42360</b><br>This specific number highlights the substantial size of the group returning to Jerusalem, indicating a significant movement of people. The precision of the number suggests an official record, possibly for administrative or logistical purposes. This figure does not include servants and singers, which are mentioned separately in the following verses, indicating that the total number of people involved in the return was even larger. The return of such a large group fulfills the promises of restoration and renewal found in the prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, and sets the stage for the rebuilding of the temple and the re-establishment of worship in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>This refers to the group of Israelites who returned from the Babylonian exile to Jerusalem and Judah.

Corporate obedience flows from corporate identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>numbered</b><p>Scripture treats counting as a spiritual act when it acknowledges God&#8217;s ownership of His people (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Recording numbers shows that the return from exile is a real, historical event, not myth or legend.<p>&#8226; Each individual mattered; nothing was left vague or approximate (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Census language also hints at order and preparedness for service (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17-18</a>). Just as the wilderness generation was counted for warfare and worship, this remnant is counted for rebuilding and renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>42,360</b><p>The precise total stresses God&#8217;s faithful preservation of a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The same figure appears in <a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66</a>, confirming the accuracy and consistency of Scripture.<p>&#8226; Though modest beside Israel&#8217;s former multitudes, 42,360 is sizable enough to re-establish society, proving that restoration does not depend on overwhelming numbers but on God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This literal headcount invites comparison with other divinely preserved groups&#8212;7,000 in Elijah&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>) and the sealed servants in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>&#8212;demonstrating the Lord&#8217;s ongoing pattern of guarding a faithful core.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a> assures us that God gathers, counts, and keeps His people. &#8220;The whole assembly&#8221; highlights covenant unity, &#8220;numbered&#8221; shows individual value within ordered service, and &#8220;42,360&#8221; confirms the literal, historical faithfulness of God to sustain a remnant for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(64) This sum total is the same in Nehemiah; but the several sums in Ezra make 29,818, and in Nehemiah 31,089. The apocryphal Esdras agrees in the total, but makes in the particulars 33,950, adding that children below twelve were not reckoned. Many expedients of reconciliation have been adopted; but it is better to suppose that errors had crept into the original documents.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore.</span> Ezra's numbers, as given in detail (vers. 3-60), produce when added together a total of only 29,818; Nehemiah's items (<a href="/nehemiah/7-8.htm">Nehemiah 7:8-62</a>) give a total of 31,089; those of the apocryphal Esdras a total of 33,950. The three authorities agree, however, in their summation, all alike declaring that the actual number of those who returned with Zerubbabel was 42,360. Esdras adds that children under twelve years of age are not included. If this were so, the entire number must have exceeded 50,000 - an enormous body of persons to transport a distance of above a thousand miles, according to Western experience, but one which will not surprise those acquainted with the East. In the East caravans of from ten to twenty thousand souls often traverse huge distances without serious mishap, and migrations frequently take place on a much grander scale. In the year 1771, 50,000 families of Torgouths, reckoned to number 300,000 souls, arrived on the frontiers of China, after a journey of 10,000 leagues through a most difficult country, and were given lands in the Chinese empire. They were followed in the next year by 180,000 Eleuths and others, who had accomplished a similar distance (see De Hell, 'Travels,' pp. 228, 229). Jenghis Khan is said to have forced 100,000 artisans and craftsmen to emigrate in a body from Khiva into Mongolia (Howarth's 'History of the Mongols,' p. 85). The transplantation of entire nations was an established practice among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. THE NUMBER OF THE SLAVES, HORSES, MULES, CAMELS, AND ASSES OF THOSE WHO RETURNED (vers, 65-67). It may seem strange that matters of this trivial character should be recorded with such exactness in Holy Writ; but enumerations similar in character are not unfrequent (see <a href="/genesis/23-14.htm">Genesis 23:14, 15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). They may perhaps be viewed as teaching the lesson that with God nothing is too trivial for exact knowledge, even "all the hairs of our head" being "numbered" (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>). In the present passage the enumeration is not altogether without a further historical value, since it is indicative of the general poverty and low estate of the returning exiles, who had but one slave and one ass to every six of their number, one horse to every sixty, one camel to every hundred, and one mule to every one hundred and seventy-five. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/2-64.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">assembly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#257;&#183;h&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6951.htm">Strong's 6951: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assembly, convocation, congregation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[numbered]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">42,360 {},</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">OT History: Ezra 2:64 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand (Ezr.
