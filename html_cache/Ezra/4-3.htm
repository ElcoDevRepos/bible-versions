They decline outside, syncretistic help, standing on both God&#8217;s covenant and Cyrus&#8217; decree. The verse calls believers today to honor God-appointed leadership, guard doctrinal purity, and trust that obedience to God outweighs any advantage gained through compromise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Ye have nothing to do with us.</span>--The account in 2 Kings 17 carefully studied will show that the stern refusal of the leaders was precisely ill harmony with the will of God; there was nothing in it of that intolerant spirit which is sometimes imagined. The whole design of the Great Restoration would have been defeated by a concession at this point. The reference to the command of Cyrus is another and really subordinate kind of justification, pleaded as subjects of the King of Persia, whose decree was absolute and exclusive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have nothing to do with us to build a</span> <span class="cmt_word">house unto our God.</span> You have no ground on which to rest your claim of uniting with us in this matter.
