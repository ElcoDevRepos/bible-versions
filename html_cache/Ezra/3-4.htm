This celebration is significant as it reflects obedience to God's commands found in <a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>. It is a time of joy and thanksgiving for the harvest, symbolizing God's provision and protection. The feast also points forward to the messianic age, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>, where all nations will celebrate it in the future kingdom.<p><b>in accordance with what is written</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of adhering to the Scriptures, specifically the Torah, which contains the laws and instructions given by God to Moses. The Israelites' commitment to follow the written law highlights their desire to restore proper worship and align themselves with God's covenant. This obedience is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14-18</a>, where the people rediscover and observe the Feast of Tabernacles after reading the Law.<p><b>and they offered burnt offerings daily</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. These offerings, described in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>, were completely consumed by fire, representing the worshiper's total surrender to God. The daily offerings reflect a continuous act of worship and devotion, emphasizing the need for regular communion with God. This practice is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>based on the number prescribed for each day</b><br>The specific number of offerings for each day is detailed in <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>, which outlines the sacrifices required during the Feast of Tabernacles. This meticulous adherence to the prescribed offerings demonstrates the Israelites' commitment to follow God's instructions precisely. It also highlights the structured and ordered nature of worship in the Old Testament, which foreshadows the order and peace found in Christ's kingdom. The precision in these offerings points to the fulfillment of the law in Jesus, who perfectly met all its requirements (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The returning exiles who are rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem and re-establishing their religious practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, living in temporary shelters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the temple is being rebuilt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the return of the exiles and the restoration of the temple and religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_commands.htm">Faithfulness to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' observance of the Feast of Tabernacles as prescribed demonstrates their commitment to following God's laws.
