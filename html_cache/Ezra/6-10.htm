It reflects the Jewish understanding of God as the ultimate authority, transcending earthly powers.

The use of "God of heaven" is significant in the context of Persian influence, as it aligns with the Persian recognition of a supreme deity.<p><b>and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons</b><br>This reflects the practice of intercessory prayer, where the Israelites were encouraged to pray for their leaders.

Individual kings must die, but the house would go on (see the speech of Artemisia to Xerxes in 'Herod.,' 8:102; and compare the references to the "gods of the royal house" in the Inscriptions). Kings took special care of their sons. Thus Cyrus sent Cambyses back to Persia when he was about to attack the Massagetae ('Herod.,' 1:208), and Xerxes gave several of his sons into the charge of Artemisia, to convey them by ship to Asia, while he himself took the long and perilous journey by land (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:103). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they will be able</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;&#1457;&#1493;&#1466;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;h&#277;&#183;w&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1934.htm">Strong's 1934: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become, come to pass, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to offer sacrifices</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;haq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7127.htm">Strong's 7127: </a> </span><span class="str2">To approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a sweet aroma</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7717;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5208.htm">Strong's 5208: </a> </span><span class="str2">Soothing, tranquilizing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
