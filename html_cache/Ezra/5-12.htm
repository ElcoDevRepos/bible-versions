The "God of heaven" is a title emphasizing God's sovereignty and authority over all creation. This acknowledgment of sin is consistent with the Deuteronomic history, where blessings and curses are contingent upon Israel's obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The phrase reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine judgment.<p><b>He delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the historical event of the Babylonian exile, which occurred in 586 BC when Nebuchadnezzar II conquered Jerusalem. The phrase "delivered them into the hand" indicates God's active role in allowing this judgment as a consequence of Israel's sin. Nebuchadnezzar, as king of Babylon, was used by God as an instrument of judgment, similar to how God used other nations to discipline Israel throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>).<p><b>the Chaldean who destroyed this temple</b><br>The Chaldeans were a Semitic people who became the ruling class in Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar's destruction of the temple in Jerusalem was a significant event, marking the loss of the central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple's destruction fulfilled prophecies such as those found in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a> and <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>. The loss of the temple symbolized the severing of the Israelites' direct access to God, highlighting the severity of their disobedience.<p><b>and carried away the people to Babylon</b><br>The exile to Babylon was a pivotal moment in Jewish history, lasting approximately 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). This period of captivity was a time of reflection and transformation for the Jewish people, leading to a renewed commitment to the Law and the eventual rebuilding of the temple. The exile also served as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus would later deliver humanity from the captivity of sin, offering restoration and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the ancestors of the Israelites who sinned against God, leading to their exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_heaven.htm">God of Heaven</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and authority over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that captured Judah and took the Israelites into exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldean.htm">Chaldean</a></b><br>A term often used interchangeably with Babylonian, referring to the people of Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The verse highlights the serious consequences of turning away from God.

Mainly by their long series of idolatries, with the moral abominations that those idolatries involved - the sacrifice of children by their own parents, the licentious rites belonging to the worship of Baal, and the unmentionable horrors practised by the devotees of the Dea Syra. For centuries, with only short and rare intervals, "the chief of the priests, and the people, had transgressed very much after <span class="accented">all</span> the abominations of the heathen," and had even "polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon</span>.

Making an idolatrous people, but a less guilty one, his sword, he cut off Judah, as he had previously cut off Israel, causing the national life to cease, and even removing the bulk of the people into a distant country. Not by his own power or might did Nebuchadnezzar prevail. God could have delivered the Jews from him as easily as he had delivered them in former days from Jabin (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-24</a>), and from Zerah (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11-15</a>), and from Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-36</a>).
