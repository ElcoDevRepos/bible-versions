Throughout its history, Jerusalem was ruled by several mighty kings, including David and Solomon, who established it as the political and spiritual center of Israel. The reference to "mighty kings" underscores the city's importance and the strength of its rulers. This aligns with biblical accounts in 2 Samuel and 1 Kings, where the reigns of David and Solomon are detailed, showcasing their military and administrative prowess.<p><b>and exercised authority over the whole region west of the Euphrates;</b><br>The region west of the Euphrates, often referred to as "Beyond the River," was a significant area in the ancient Near East, encompassing parts of modern-day Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. The phrase indicates the extent of the authority and influence that Jerusalem's kings had, reaching beyond their immediate borders. This reflects the historical reality of the Davidic and Solomonic empires, which expanded their territories and exerted control over neighboring regions. The mention of the Euphrates also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's promised land, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>.<p><b>and tribute, duty, and toll were paid to them.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the economic and political power wielded by the kings of Jerusalem. Tribute, duty, and tolls were common forms of taxation in the ancient world, used to support the ruling government and its projects. The payment of these by surrounding nations or regions indicates a recognition of authority and submission to Jerusalem's rulers. This practice is documented in various parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>, where Solomon's wealth and the tribute he received are described. It also reflects the broader theme of God's provision and blessing upon Israel when they were obedient to His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and governance, often a focal point of conflict and restoration throughout biblical history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/powerful_kings.htm">Powerful Kings</a></b><br>Refers to the historical rulers who had dominion over Jerusalem, including those from the Babylonian and Persian empires.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_beyond_the_river.htm">The Region Beyond the River</a></b><br>This phrase typically refers to the area west of the Euphrates River, encompassing parts of modern-day Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribute,_duty,_and_toll.htm">Tribute, Duty, and Toll</a></b><br>These were forms of taxation imposed by ruling empires on their subjects, indicating subjugation and control.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who played a crucial role in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon and the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_historical_context.htm">Understanding Historical Context</a></b><br>Recognize the historical backdrop of foreign domination over Jerusalem, which sets the stage for the challenges faced by the returning exiles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_governance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Governance</a></b><br>Despite the rule of powerful kings, God's ultimate authority and plan for His people remain unchanged.

Ezra&#8217;s opponents remind Artaxerxes that Jerusalem has not always been weak; it once housed &#8220;mighty kings.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture confirms this reputation:<p>&#8211; David&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a>) marks the rise of a powerful, united kingdom.<p>&#8211; Solomon &#8220;surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-22.htm">2 Chronicles 9:22-23</a>), making Jerusalem a center of influence.<p>&#8226; By citing these kings, the letter-writers subtly warn the Persian throne: if Jerusalem is rebuilt, past strength could resurface.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Authority over the whole region west of the Euphrates</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;region west of the Euphrates&#8221; (Beyond the River) was Persian administrative language for everything from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean.<p>&#8226; Solomon once &#8220;had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates&#8212;from Tiphsah to Gaza&#8212;over all the kings west of the Euphrates&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Even after Solomon, kings like Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6-8</a>) projected influence into neighboring territories.<p>&#8226; The letter&#8217;s authors marshal this history to argue that Jerusalem&#8217;s sphere once rivaled, and could again challenge, Persian authority in that same district.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tribute, duty, and toll were paid to them</b><p>&#8226; Economic evidence seals the argument: former Judean kings collected taxes from surrounding peoples.<p>&#8211; Under Solomon, &#8220;they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Visitors brought yearly &#8220;articles of silver and gold&#8230; horses and mules&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Tribute implies acknowledged sovereignty; duty and toll point to customs fees on trade routes passing through Judean territory.<p>&#8226; By underscoring this revenue stream, the writers suggest Persia stands to lose tax income if Jerusalem regains autonomy (cf. <a href="/ezra/4-13.htm">Ezra 4:13, 15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-20.htm">Ezra 4:20</a> is part of a calculated letter meant to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Its three claims&#8212;Jerusalem once hosted mighty kings, dominated lands west of the Euphrates, and enjoyed steady tax revenue&#8212;are historically accurate, as confirmed by passages on David and Solomon. The adversaries leverage this truthful history to paint the city as a potential political and economic threat to Persia, hoping fear will persuade Artaxerxes to stop the work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Mighty kings.</span>--David and Solomon, and some few kings down to Josiah, had extended their sway and made nations tributary (2 Samuel 8; 1 Kings 10).
