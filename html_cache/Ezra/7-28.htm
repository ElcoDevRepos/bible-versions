This favor is significant as it reflects God's providence in the affairs of His people. The Persian Empire, known for its vast reach and influence, had a structured administration with counselors and officials who played crucial roles in governance. Ezra's favor with these leaders highlights God's sovereignty in using foreign powers to fulfill His purposes, similar to how Joseph found favor in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). This favor is a fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>.<p><b>And because the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,</b><br>The phrase "the hand of the LORD" signifies divine intervention and blessing. This expression is used throughout Ezra and Nehemiah to denote God's active role in guiding and empowering His servants (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>). It underscores the belief that success in any endeavor, especially one as significant as the return from exile, is due to God's direct involvement. This divine hand is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator and guide for believers, ensuring that God's will is accomplished.<p><b>I took courage and gathered the leaders of Israel to return with me.</b><br>Ezra's courage is a response to God's favor and presence. The gathering of Israel's leaders indicates a strategic and organized effort to restore the community in Jerusalem. This return is part of the larger narrative of the Jewish exiles' return, as prophesied by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). The leaders' involvement is crucial for the re-establishment of religious and social order, reflecting the importance of leadership in God's plan. This act of gathering and leading parallels the role of Jesus Christ, who gathers His people and leads them into the Kingdom of God (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a key figure in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Ezra openly attributes every good outcome to God&#8217;s initiative rather than to luck or human diplomacy (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The phrase reminds us that divine favor is personal and active.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the king</b><p>Artaxerxes, the most powerful man on earth at the time, responds positively to Ezra because God turns his heart (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>). The verse underscores that earthly authority is subordinate to heavenly authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His counselors</b><p>The royal advisers&#8212;men who could easily have resisted&#8212;also look kindly on Ezra. God&#8217;s favor permeates every layer of governance (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;5</a>), showing that the LORD can orchestrate a consensus for His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all his powerful officials</b><p>Even the military and administrative leaders cooperate. God&#8217;s reach extends to &#8220;all&#8221; who might influence the outcome (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). Nothing is outside His jurisdiction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And because the hand of the LORD my God was upon me</b><p>Ezra repeats a theme found throughout the book (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 9</a>; 8:18). &#8220;Hand&#8221; pictures God&#8217;s direct, guiding involvement (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). The phrase assures us that divine guidance is not abstract but tangible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I took courage</b><p>Knowing God&#8217;s hand is upon him, Ezra refuses timidity (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). Courage here is not self-generated bravado; it is confidence birthed from recognizing God&#8217;s active presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And gathered the leaders of Israel</b><p>Spiritual boldness leads to decisive action. Ezra assembles heads of families and tribal leaders (<a href="/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1</a>), modeling servant leadership that mobilizes others for God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To return with me</b><p>The goal is restoration&#8212;bringing God&#8217;s people back to the land and the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>). The verse ties personal favor to a corporate mission; God blesses His servant so that His people may fulfill their calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a> shows a clear sequence: God grants favor, that favor spreads through every authority figure, Ezra recognizes God&#8217;s hand, gains courage, and acts to advance the covenant community&#8217;s return.
