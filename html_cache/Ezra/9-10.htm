It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God is acknowledged as the sovereign Lord. This invocation is common in prayers of confession and supplication throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5-11</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4-19</a>, where the people turn to God in times of distress.<p><b>what can we say after this?</b><br>This rhetorical question expresses a sense of guilt and helplessness. It acknowledges the gravity of the situation and the inadequacy of any excuse or justification. This mirrors other biblical instances where individuals or groups are confronted with their sin, such as in <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4-5</a> and <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, emphasizing the need for repentance and divine mercy.<p><b>For we have forsaken the commandments</b><br>This confession highlights the specific sin of abandoning God's laws, which were given to guide Israel in righteousness and holiness. The commandments refer to the Mosaic Law, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil precepts. Forsaking these commandments often led to consequences such as exile, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of disobedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>. It also foreshadows the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly kept the law and offers redemption for transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>- By beginning with &#8220;our God,&#8221; he reminds the returned exiles that they belong to Him; covenant relationship is intact even after failure (cf. <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>- This opening phrase sets the tone of humble dependence&#8212;Ezra is not appealing to human solutions but to divine mercy, just as Jehoshaphat once prayed, &#8220;We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what can we say after this?</b><p>- Ezra is stunned by the depth of Israel&#8217;s sin; words feel inadequate (cf. <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>).<p>- &#8220;After this&#8221; points to the immediate context: the intermarriage with pagan peoples (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1&#8211;2</a>) and the long history of disobedience that had led to exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7&#8211;23</a>).<p>- He models true contrition: no excuses, no self-justification, only silence before a holy God (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>; <a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>).<p>- This rhetorical question underscores that repentance involves recognizing sin&#8217;s seriousness so deeply that explanation seems impossible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For we have forsaken the commandments</b><p>- Ezra names the offense plainly&#8212;&#8220;we,&#8221; not &#8220;they,&#8221; embracing corporate responsibility (cf. <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>- &#8220;Forsaken&#8221; conveys willful departure, not accidental slip; God&#8217;s commands on separation from idolatry were clear (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>- The phrase highlights the contrast between God&#8217;s unchanging word and the people&#8217;s wavering hearts (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> vs. <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>).<p>- Recognizing that they abandoned divine directives, Ezra indirectly affirms the commandments&#8217; continued authority and literal application for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10</a> captures a moment of raw confession: the people, freshly reminded of God&#8217;s faithfulness, realize they have yet again walked away from His explicit commands. Ezra&#8217;s address&#8212;anchored in relationship (&#8220;our God&#8221;), marked by speechless awe at sin&#8217;s gravity (&#8220;what can we say&#8221;), and ending in candid admission (&#8220;we have forsaken the commandments&#8221;)&#8212;shows how genuine repentance begins: by acknowledging God&#8217;s presence, silencing self-defense, and agreeing with His word about our disobedience. These steps remain timeless for believers who desire restored fellowship and renewed obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can we say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have forsaken</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1430;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;za&#7687;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5800.htm">Strong's 5800: </a> </span><span class="str2">To loosen, relinquish, permit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the commandments</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1466;&#1514;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4687.htm">Strong's 4687: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commandment</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/9-10.htm">OT History: Ezra 9:10 Now our God what shall we say (Ezr.
