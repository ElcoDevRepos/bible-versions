It reflects a fulfillment of God's promise to move the hearts of others to assist His people (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). The support from neighbors can be seen as a divine orchestration, similar to the Egyptians giving the Israelites goods during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><b>with articles of silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold were valuable commodities in the ancient Near East, often used for trade, currency, and religious offerings. The provision of these precious metals signifies the wealth and resources needed for the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. This mirrors the wealth given to the Israelites during the Exodus, symbolizing God's provision and blessing (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>).<p><b>with goods and livestock</b><br>Goods and livestock were essential for sustaining the returning exiles on their journey and for re-establishing their community in Jerusalem. Livestock, in particular, was crucial for agriculture and sacrifices. This provision underscores the practical needs being met by God through the generosity of others, reminiscent of the support given to the Israelites in their wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>).<p><b>and with valuables</b><br>The term "valuables" encompasses a wide range of precious items, possibly including jewels, fine clothing, and other luxury goods. These items would have been used for both personal and communal purposes, including the adornment of the temple. This reflects the wealth of nations being brought to God's people, a theme echoed in prophecies about the future glory of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-7</a>).<p><b>in addition to all their freewill offerings</b><br>Freewill offerings were voluntary gifts given out of devotion and gratitude to God, beyond what was required by law. This phrase indicates the heartfelt generosity of the people, both those returning and those remaining, in supporting the temple's reconstruction. It highlights the importance of willing and joyful giving in worship, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The Jewish exiles who were returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, as decreed by King Cyrus of Persia.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>The people living around the Israelites in exile, likely including both fellow Jews and non-Jews, who provided support for the journey and the rebuilding efforts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_cyrus_of_persia.htm">King Cyrus of Persia</a></b><br>The ruler who issued the decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, fulfilling God's prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city to which the exiles were returning, significant as the center of Jewish worship and identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Jewish people, which was to be rebuilt as a symbol of God's presence and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_through_others.htm">God's Provision Through Others</a></b><br>God often uses people around us to provide for our needs.
