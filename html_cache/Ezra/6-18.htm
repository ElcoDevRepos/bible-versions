This division ensured that the priestly duties were carried out systematically and in an orderly manner. The priests were descendants of Aaron, and their roles were crucial for maintaining the temple services and rituals. This structure highlights the importance of order and tradition in worship, emphasizing continuity with past practices.<p><b>and the Levites by their groups</b><br>The Levites, distinct from the priests, were responsible for various supportive roles in temple worship, including music, gatekeeping, and assisting the priests.

Godly leadership always begins with clear, divinely directed appointments&#8212;just as Paul later charged Titus to &#8220;appoint elders in every town&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priests by their divisions</b><p>The temple could function only when the sons of Aaron served in their ancient rotations.<p>&#8226;

Ezra and his contemporaries took the same stance: later, &#8220;all the people&#8230; told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Revival always anchors itself to the written word.

This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-26</a>), and, so far, was <span class="cmt_word">according to the writing of the book of Moses.</span> But the "courses" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (<a href="/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19-22</a>). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year <span class="date">B.C. 726</span>, recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, and that celebrated by Josiah in <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>, recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of <span class="date">B.C. 516</span> in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They also appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1511;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;q&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
