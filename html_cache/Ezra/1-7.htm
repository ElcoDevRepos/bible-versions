This act of returning the temple articles signifies the restoration of worship and the fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people back. The articles belonging to the house of the LORD refer to sacred items used in temple worship, which were taken by Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian conquest. This action by Cyrus aligns with Isaiah's prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) where Cyrus is named as the one who will decree the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple.<p><b>that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, had previously conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple in 586 BC, taking these sacred articles as spoils of war. This event marked the beginning of the Babylonian exile, a period of significant hardship and reflection for the Jewish people. The removal of these items symbolized the loss of God's presence and favor, as the temple was the center of Jewish worship and identity.<p><b>and placed in the temple of his gods.</b><br>The articles were placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar's gods, likely in Babylon, as a demonstration of the supposed superiority of Babylonian deities over the God of Israel. This act was common in the ancient Near East, where conquering nations would display captured religious items to signify their gods' dominance. However, the return of these articles by Cyrus underscores the sovereignty of the God of Israel, who orchestrates events to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the eventual return and restoration of the Jewish people and their worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_cyrus.htm">King Cyrus</a></b><br>The Persian king who conquered Babylon and issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.
