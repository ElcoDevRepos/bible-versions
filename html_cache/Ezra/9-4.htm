The "words of the God of Israel" refer to the Law and commandments given through Moses, which were central to Jewish life and worship. This trembling indicates a deep respect and acknowledgment of God's holiness and authority. It echoes <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>, where God esteems those who are humble and contrite in spirit and who tremble at His word. This reverence is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of obedience and the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>gathered around me</b><br>The gathering around Ezra signifies a communal response to the spiritual crisis at hand. Ezra, a scribe and priest, was a leader and teacher of the Law, and his presence provided guidance and direction. This assembly reflects the biblical principle of seeking godly leadership and counsel in times of distress, as seen in other instances such as Nehemiah's leadership in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. It also prefigures the New Testament church's practice of gathering for teaching, prayer, and mutual encouragement (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p><b>because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles</b><br>The "unfaithfulness of the exiles" refers to the sin of intermarriage with pagan nations, which was strictly forbidden in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This unfaithfulness was not merely a social issue but a spiritual one, as it threatened the purity of worship and the distinct identity of God's people. Historically, the return from exile was a time of rebuilding and reestablishing the covenant community, and such unfaithfulness posed a significant threat to these efforts. This situation parallels the warnings given by prophets like Malachi, who called for faithfulness to God's covenant.<p><b>while I sat there in horror</b><br>Ezra's reaction of sitting in horror underscores the gravity of the situation. His response is one of deep mourning and shock, reflecting the biblical practice of lament in the face of sin and its consequences. This posture of sitting in horror is akin to the actions of other biblical figures who mourned over sin, such as Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3-4</a>). It demonstrates a profound awareness of the holiness of God and the seriousness of covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>until the evening offering</b><br>The evening offering, part of the daily sacrificial system, was a time of prayer and atonement (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39-42</a>). This reference to the evening offering situates the narrative within the context of Israel's worship practices, emphasizing the importance of regular, communal acts of devotion and repentance. The timing also suggests a period of reflection and preparation for seeking God's mercy. The sacrificial system, with its offerings, foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides atonement for sin once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

The evening sacrifice took place at three in the afternoon. Ezra must, therefore, either from the intensity of his own feelings or with the view of impressing the people, have "sat astonied" - speechless and motionless - for several hours. EZRA'S CONFESSION AND PRAYER TO GOD (<a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5-15</a>). The most remarkable feature of Ezra's confession is the thoroughness with which he identifies himself with his erring countrymen, blushes for their transgressions, and is ashamed for their misconduct. All their sins he appears to consider as his sins, all their disobedience as his disobedience, all their perils as his perils. Another striking feature is his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of the particular sin of the time (see vers. 6, 7, 10). He views it as a "great trespass" - one that "is grown up into the heavens" - which is equivalent to a complete forsaking of God's commandments, and on account of Which he and his people "cannot stand before" God. This feeling seems based partly on the nature of the sin itself (ver. 14), but also, and in an especial way, on a strong sense of the ingratitude shown by the people in turning from God so soon after he had forgiven their former sins against him, and allowed them to return from the captivity, rebuild the temple, and re-establish themselves as a nation. If after their deliverance they again fell away, the sin could not but be unpardonable; and the punishment to be expected was a final uprooting and destruction from which there could be no recovery (vers. 13, 14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then everyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who trembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2730.htm">Strong's 2730: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fearful, reverential</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7695;i&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
