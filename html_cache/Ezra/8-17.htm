He sends trusted men to Iddo at Casiphia, valuing both lineage and willingness. The passage underscores intentional leadership, covenant community, and proper worship order. God supplies every needed gift when His people cooperate, ensuring that ministry in His house is carried out with reverence and unity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The place Casiphia.</span>--Evidently near Ahavah, and a colony of Jews presided over by Iddo, one of the humble race of the Nethinims, but at present chief under the Persians.
