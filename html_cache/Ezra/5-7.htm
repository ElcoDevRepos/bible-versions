The context is the rebuilding of the Jerusalem temple, which had been halted under previous Persian rulers. The officials, including Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the River (Euphrates), are seeking clarification on whether the Jews have royal permission to continue their work. This reflects the bureaucratic processes of the Persian Empire, where communication with the central authority was crucial for governance.<p><b>To King Darius:</b><br>Darius I, also known as Darius the Great, reigned from 522 to 486 BC. He was known for consolidating and expanding the Persian Empire, as well as for his administrative reforms. His reign is significant in biblical history as it coincides with the return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. The mention of Darius highlights the historical context of the Persian Empire's influence over the Jewish people during this period.<p><b>All peace.</b><br>This greeting is a customary salutation in ancient Near Eastern correspondence, expressing a wish for the recipient's well-being and prosperity. It reflects the formal and respectful tone expected in communications with a monarch. The phrase "all peace" is similar to the Hebrew word "shalom," which encompasses peace, completeness, and welfare.
