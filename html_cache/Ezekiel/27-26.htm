The "oarsmen" symbolize the city's leaders and merchants who have guided Tyre to economic and political heights. Historically, Tyre was a major trading hub, and its people were renowned for their seafaring abilities. The "high seas" represent the vast opportunities and wealth that Tyre accessed through its extensive trade networks. This imagery underscores the city's reliance on its own strength and expertise, which is a recurring theme in the Bible where human pride and self-reliance often precede downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>but the east wind will shatter you</b><br>The "east wind" is a metaphor for destructive forces, often used in the Bible to signify God's judgment (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>). In the context of Ezekiel, it represents the impending Babylonian invasion led by King Nebuchadnezzar. The east wind, coming from the desert, was known for its harshness and ability to bring devastation, symbolizing the unstoppable and divine nature of the judgment against Tyre. This reflects the biblical principle that no human power can withstand God's will (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23-24</a>).<p><b>in the heart of the sea</b><br>The "heart of the sea" indicates the central and most vulnerable part of Tyre's existence&#8212;its maritime trade and economic lifeline. Geographically, Tyre was an island city, heavily dependent on the sea for its prosperity. The phrase suggests that the very source of Tyre's strength will become the site of its downfall. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures where the sea is a place of chaos and judgment (<a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).
