The act of measuring signifies God's order and precision, reflecting His sovereignty and the importance of the temple as a place of divine presence. The west side of the temple is significant as it often symbolizes the direction of the setting sun, which can represent the end of an era or the completion of a divine plan. In biblical symbolism, the west can also be associated with the Gentile nations, suggesting the inclusivity of God's plan.<p><b>to be five hundred cubits long</b><br>The measurement of five hundred cubits is substantial, indicating the grandeur and majesty of the temple structure. A cubit, an ancient unit of length, is generally considered to be about 18 inches or 45 centimeters. This measurement emphasizes the temple's vastness and the meticulous nature of God's design. The number five hundred can symbolize completeness and divine grace, suggesting the temple's role in God's redemptive plan. This measurement aligns with other biblical descriptions of sacred spaces, such as the dimensions given for the New Jerusalem in Revelation, highlighting the continuity of God's plan from the Old to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
