Historically, this refers to the Israelites who were exiled due to their disobedience and idolatry. Theologically, it reflects God's sovereignty and His commitment to His covenant with Israel. This act of gathering is reminiscent of the Exodus, where God brought the Israelites out of Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate gathering of believers in Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<p><b>gather them from the countries</b><br>The gathering from various countries highlights the widespread dispersion of the Israelites during the Babylonian exile. This dispersion is known as the Diaspora. The promise of regathering signifies hope and restoration. It also points to the eschatological gathering of God's people from all nations, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> and fulfilled in the church's mission to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>and bring them into their own land</b><br>This promise of return to their own land emphasizes the physical and spiritual restoration of Israel. The land of Israel holds significant covenantal importance, as it was promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This return is not just a physical relocation but a spiritual renewal, symbolizing God's faithfulness. It also prefigures the ultimate restoration of creation and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>I will feed them on the mountains of Israel</b><br>Feeding on the mountains of Israel symbolizes provision and care. The mountains represent the high places of blessing and security. This imagery is pastoral, reflecting God's role as the Shepherd of His people, a theme further developed in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>. It points to Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who provides for His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>in the ravines</b><br>The mention of ravines indicates God's provision even in the low and difficult places. It suggests that God's care is comprehensive, reaching every part of the land and every aspect of life. This reflects the biblical theme of God's presence in both the highs and lows of life, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>.<p><b>and in all the settlements of the land</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of God's provision and restoration. Every settlement, whether large or small, will experience God's blessing. It signifies the complete restoration of the nation and the fulfillment of God's promises. This comprehensive care is a type of the spiritual nourishment provided by Christ to His church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising to gather His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God promises to gather and bring back to their land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_israel.htm">Mountains of Israel</a></b><br>Symbolic of the homeland where God will bring His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations/countries.htm">Nations/Countries</a></b><br>Represents the places where the Israelites have been scattered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pasture.htm">Pasture</a></b><br>Symbolizes provision, care, and restoration by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.

Jesus, the Good Shepherd, fulfills this care, offering both physical security and spiritual sustenance (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the ravines</b><p>Even the low, rugged places are included.<p>&#8226;
