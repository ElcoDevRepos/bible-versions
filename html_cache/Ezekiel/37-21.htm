The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, a common role for prophets in the Old Testament. This underscores the importance of the message and the certainty of its fulfillment. The phrase "Lord GOD" translates to "Adonai Yahweh," highlighting both the sovereignty and covenantal relationship God has with Israel.<p><b>&#8216;I will take the Israelites out of the nations to which they have gone,</b><br>This refers to the dispersion of the Israelites, known as the Diaspora, which occurred due to various exiles, including the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. Historically, the Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria in 722 BC, and the Southern Kingdom of Judah was taken into Babylonian captivity in 586 BC. This promise of regathering is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing hope and restoration.<p><b>and I will gather them from all around</b><br>The gathering from "all around" indicates a comprehensive regathering from all the places where the Israelites have been scattered. This reflects God's omnipotence and His ability to fulfill His promises despite geographical and political barriers. It also connects to other prophetic promises of regathering found in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>.<p><b>and bring them into their own land.</b><br>The promise to bring the Israelites back to "their own land" refers to the land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This land is central to the identity and covenant relationship between God and Israel. Theologically, this return is seen as a type of the ultimate restoration and fulfillment of God's promises, prefiguring the eschatological hope of a new heaven and new earth. This also foreshadows the gathering of God's people in Christ, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as the Good Shepherd who gathers His flock (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were scattered among the nations due to their disobedience and exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Various foreign lands where the Israelites were dispersed during their exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The promised land that God vowed to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who promises to restore His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's disobedience, God remains faithful to His covenant promises.

This, however, like the other Divine promises, was fulfilled only to a "remnant," a course which, as St. Paul shows in Romans 9, had been foreseen and foretold from the first. A fulfilment on a larger scale was perpetually prevented by the sins of the people; God did for them all that their obdurate disobedience would allow Him to do. Yet He did not wholly reject them, but allowed a remnant to keep alive His Church, and become the channel of those richer blessings of the new covenant, in which all who will accept His salvation are united in a holier bond, and led to a land of higher promise than Israel after the flesh could ever know.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28</span> explain how the unification of the two kingdoms should be brought about. The first step should be the bringing of the people home to their own land (vers. 21, 22); the second, their purification from idolatry (ver. 23); the third, the installation over them, thus united and purified, of one King, the ideal David of the future, or the Messiah (vers. 24, 25); the fourth, the establishment with them of Jehovah's covenant of peace (ver. 26), and the permanent erection amongst them of Jehovah's temple (vers. 27, 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen</span>. That tills promise was intended to find an initial and partial fulfillment in the return from Babylon is undoubted. That it was also designed to look across the centuries towards the final ingathering of God's spiritual Israel into their permanent inheritance, the heavenly Canaan, an examination of its terms shows. These clearly presuppose a wider dispersion of Israel than had then, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Ezekiel's day, taken place; and that Israel has never yet been made <span class="cmt_word">one nation upon the mountains of Israel</span>, is incontestable. Nor is there ground for expecting she ever will be. Not even after the exile closed did all Israel return to Palestine. Nor did it ever come true in their experience that one king was king to them all, since, in point of fact, they never afterwards had an earthly sore-reign at all who was properly independent. If, therefore, the prince who in the future should shepherd them was not to be a temporal monarch, but the Messiah, the probability is that the Israel he should shepherd was designed to be, not Israel after the flesh, but Israel after the spirit, who should walk in his judgments and observe his statutes, and <span class="accented">who</span>, in the fullness of the times, should develop out into the Christian Church. Hence it seems reasonable to conclude that <span class="cmt_word">their own land</span>, into which they should eventually be brought, would be not so much the veritable soil from which their ancestors had been expelled, as the country or region in which the new, rejuvenated, reunited, and reformed Israel should dwell, which, again, should be n territory cleansed from sin and idolatry, so as to render it a fit abode for a people devoted to righteousness. Viewed in this light, <span class="accented">their own land</span> was first Canaan, in so far as after the exile it was cleansed from idolatry; now it is those portions of the earth in which the Christian Church has been planted, so far as these are influenced by the holy principles of religion; finally, it will be the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness (scrap. <a href="/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you are to tell them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
