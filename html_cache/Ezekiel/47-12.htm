The river represents the life-giving presence of God, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>) and the river of life in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>. The diverse fruit trees suggest the variety and richness of God's provision, indicating spiritual nourishment and blessing for all who are connected to this divine source.<p><b>Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail.</b><br>This imagery conveys the idea of perpetual vitality and productivity, reflecting the eternal nature of God's blessings. The unfailing leaves and fruit symbolize the enduring and unchanging nature of God's promises. This can be connected to <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither.<p><b>Each month they will bear fruit,</b><br>The monthly bearing of fruit signifies continuous and consistent provision, unlike the natural cycle of fruit trees which bear seasonally. This suggests a supernatural element, emphasizing God's ability to provide abundantly and consistently. It also points to the idea of spiritual fruitfulness in the life of believers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit is described.<p><b>because the water from the sanctuary flows to them.</b><br>The source of this life and fruitfulness is the water from the sanctuary, indicating that true life and sustenance come from God's presence. The sanctuary represents God's dwelling place, and the flowing water symbolizes the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>, where Jesus speaks of living water flowing from within believers. This highlights the transformative power of God's Spirit in bringing life and growth.<p><b>Their fruit will be used for food and their leaves for healing.</b><br>The dual purpose of the fruit and leaves underscores the comprehensive nature of God's provision&#8212;both physical and spiritual. The fruit provides sustenance, while the leaves offer healing, pointing to the holistic restoration found in God's kingdom. This echoes <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>, where the leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations, symbolizing the ultimate restoration and healing brought by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who received visions and prophecies during the Babylonian exile.

These trees with their supernatural virtues are represented as produced by the waters because "they issued out of the sanctuary," thus presenting a most effective image of the life-giving power of those spiritual influences which come from God upon men.<p>It has been objected to the spiritual interpretation of this vision, that under it nothing can be made of the fishermen of <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand on it from Engedi even to Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.">Ezekiel 47:10</a>, and that, therefore, the whole is to be considered as a glorification of nature in the future Palestine. But this is to forget that in every figure and parable there are, and must be, details necessary to the figure which have nothing answering to them in the thing signified, and that it is the habit of Ezekiel to carry out such details very far. In this case, the mention of the fishermen greatly heightens the imagery of the life-giving power of the waters; while, if the whole were to be literally understood, they would really have no place, because there would be no such fishermen in the supposed glorified condition of the land.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-23</a>, which, as already said, properly belong to Ezekiel 48, give the boundaries of the land to be divided among the tribes, together with provision for the inheritance of strangers living among them. The tracing of the boundary itself is introduced by some general statements in <a href="/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-14</a>, concerning the distribution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The effect of the river upon the vegetation growing on its banks is the last feature added to the prophet's picture.

This remarkable productivity, the prophet saw, was due, not so much to the fact that the tree roots sucked up moisture from the stream, as to the circumstance that the waters which they drank up <span class="cmt_word">issued out of the sanctuary.</span> To the same circumstance were owing the nutritive and medicinal properties of their fruit and leaves respectively. The picture in this verse is unmistakably based on <a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>, and is as clearly reproduced by the Apocalyptic seer in <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>.
