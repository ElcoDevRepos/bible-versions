The people entering signifies the collective worship and assembly of the Israelites, highlighting the communal aspect of worship in ancient Israel. This practice is rooted in the Mosaic Law, where communal gatherings were essential for maintaining the covenant relationship with God (Leviticus 23). The temple served as the central place of worship, and entering it was a significant act of devotion and obedience.<p><b>the prince shall go in with them</b><br>The "prince" in this context is often understood to be a leader or ruler of the people, possibly a Davidic figure, symbolizing leadership that aligns with God's covenant. This phrase emphasizes the role of the prince as a participant in worship, not just a ruler. It reflects the ideal of a leader who is spiritually aligned with the people, reminiscent of King David, who was both a king and a worshiper (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>). The prince's participation underscores the unity between the leader and the people in their devotion to God.<p><b>and when they leave</b><br>This indicates the orderly and communal nature of worship, where the people and the prince exit together after the service. It suggests a structured approach to worship, reflecting the orderliness prescribed in the Law (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). The act of leaving together symbolizes the continuation of community and shared faith beyond the temple walls, reinforcing the idea that worship is not confined to a place but is a way of life.<p><b>he shall leave</b><br>The prince leaving with the people signifies his role as a servant-leader, one who is among the people rather than above them. This reflects the biblical ideal of leadership, where leaders are called to serve (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>). It also points to the eschatological hope of a future leader who will perfectly embody this servant leadership, often seen as a type of Christ, who is both King and Servant (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>). This anticipates the Messianic fulfillment where Christ, the ultimate Prince of Peace, leads His people in perfect unity and worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler who plays a significant role in the worship practices described in Ezekiel.
