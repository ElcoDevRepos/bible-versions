In the context of Ezekiel, this reflects the broader theme of personal responsibility and accountability before God. The Israelites were often warned against turning away from God's laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-17.htm">Deuteronomy 30:17-18</a>. The idea of turning away is also echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>, which warns against falling away after having received the knowledge of the truth.<p><b>and commits iniquity</b><br>Iniquity refers to gross injustice or wickedness, a deviation from what is right. The Hebrew word for iniquity, "avon," implies a twisting or perversion of what is good. This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and its consequences. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on communal and individual adherence to the law, as seen in the covenantal relationship between God and His people. The prophets, including Ezekiel, often called out the iniquities of the people, urging them to repent and return to righteousness.<p><b>he will die for it</b><br>This statement emphasizes the principle of divine justice, where each person is held accountable for their actions. The death mentioned here can be understood both physically and spiritually, as separation from God. In Ezekiel's time, the concept of retributive justice was prevalent, where actions had direct consequences. This is consistent with the warnings found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which states that the way of sin leads to death. Theologically, this also points to the ultimate consequence of sin, which is spiritual death, as articulated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the need for continual faithfulness and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who live according to God's laws and standards.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Refers to sin or moral wrongdoing, a deviation from God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>In this context, it signifies spiritual death or separation from God due to sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, who were in exile and needed guidance and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_perseverance_in_righteousness.htm">The Importance of Perseverance in Righteousness</a></b><br>Righteousness is not a one-time achievement but a continual pursuit.
