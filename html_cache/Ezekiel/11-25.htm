The exiles were those who had been taken captive from Jerusalem and Judah during the Babylonian conquest. This phrase highlights Ezekiel's role as a communicator of God's messages to his fellow captives. The exiles were in a foreign land, longing for their homeland, and Ezekiel's messages often provided both warnings and hope. This context is crucial as it underscores the importance of Ezekiel's prophetic role in maintaining the spiritual identity and hope of the Jewish people during their captivity.<p><b>everything the LORD had shown me</b><br>Ezekiel was known for his vivid and symbolic visions, which were direct revelations from God. These visions often contained messages of judgment, restoration, and the future glory of Israel. The phrase indicates the completeness and faithfulness of Ezekiel's transmission of God's revelations. It reflects the prophetic responsibility to convey God's word accurately and fully, as seen in other prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah. The visions Ezekiel received included the departure of God's glory from the temple, the promise of a new heart and spirit for the people, and the eventual restoration of Israel, all of which are central themes in his book.<p><b>the LORD had shown me</b><br>This emphasizes the divine origin of Ezekiel's message. The LORD, Yahweh, is the covenant God of Israel, and His communication with Ezekiel signifies the ongoing relationship and concern God has for His people, even in exile. The phrase also highlights the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's ministry, where God reveals His plans and purposes through visions and direct communication. This divine revelation is consistent with the biblical theme of God speaking through His prophets to guide, warn, and encourage His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage.
