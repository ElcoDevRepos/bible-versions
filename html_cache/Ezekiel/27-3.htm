It was located on the Mediterranean coast, making it a significant maritime power. The city is often mentioned in the Bible as a symbol of pride and materialism. In the context of Ezekiel, Tyre represents human arrogance and self-sufficiency, which are condemned by God.<p><b>who dwells at the gateway to the sea</b><br>Tyre's strategic location made it a crucial hub for trade and commerce. The phrase "gateway to the sea" highlights its role as a major port city, facilitating trade between various nations. This geographical advantage contributed to its wealth and influence, but also to its eventual downfall as it became a target for conquest.<p><b>merchant of the peoples on many coasts</b><br>Tyre's economy was heavily reliant on trade, and it was known for its extensive commercial networks. The city traded goods such as purple dye, glass, and cedar wood, which were highly valued in the ancient world. This phrase underscores Tyre's role as a central trading power, connecting various cultures and economies.<p><b>that this is what the Lord GOD says</b><br>This introduction to the prophetic message emphasizes the authority and sovereignty of God. It serves as a reminder that despite Tyre's earthly power and wealth, it is ultimately subject to divine judgment. The use of "Lord GOD" underscores the seriousness of the message and the certainty of its fulfillment.<p><b>You have said, O Tyre, &#8216;I am perfect in beauty.&#8217;</b><br>This statement reflects Tyre's pride and self-perception. The city's wealth and success led to a sense of invincibility and self-glorification. Biblically, such pride is often a precursor to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction." The notion of "perfect in beauty" can also be seen as a type of the ultimate beauty and perfection found in Christ, contrasting human arrogance with divine humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
