In Ezekiel's vision, the measuring rod symbolizes God's precise standards and the importance of adhering to His divine plan. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>, where a measuring rod is used to measure the temple of God, indicating a connection between Ezekiel's vision and the eschatological themes in Revelation.<p><b>he measured the east side</b><br>The east side holds significant symbolic meaning in biblical literature. The east is often associated with the direction from which God's glory appears, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>, where the glory of the God of Israel comes from the east. This direction is also linked to the Garden of Eden, which was planted in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the return of Christ, who is prophesied to come from the east (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>). Measuring the east side may symbolize the preparation for the return of God's presence.<p><b>to be five hundred cubits long</b><br>The measurement of five hundred cubits is significant in the context of the temple vision. A cubit, traditionally the length from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, is approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters. The specific measurement of five hundred cubits indicates a large, defined space, emphasizing the grandeur and holiness of the temple area. This measurement reflects the perfection and completeness of God's design, as the number five hundred can symbolize completeness in biblical numerology. The detailed measurements throughout Ezekiel's vision highlight the importance of order and precision in God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Of course such a space, quite as large as was ever enclosed by the walls of ancient Jerusalem, would have been impossible upon the hill of Moriah, and various efforts have been made by some of the commentators to reduce the size; but the use of the reed as the unit of measurement is decisive. The objection to the size is without value, as Keil well says, "for the simple reason that in Ezekiel 45, 48 there follow still further statements concerning the separation of the sanctuary from the rest of the land, which are in perfect harmony with this, and show most indisputably that the Temple seen by Ezekiel was not to have its seat in the ancient Jerusalem;" nor, it may be added, in any other earthly locality. It is a vision not designed to have a material realisation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five hundred reeds</span>.
