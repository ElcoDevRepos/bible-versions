The context is a prophetic vision where God prepares a sacrificial feast, not for worship, but as a metaphor for the destruction of Israel's foes. This imagery is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern practices where sacrifices were common, but here it is inverted to depict God's triumph. The preparation indicates God's sovereignty and control over the events, aligning with His covenant promises to protect and restore Israel.<p><b>you will eat fat until you are gorged</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, fat was considered the best part of the animal, often reserved for God in sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). Here, the consumption of fat until being gorged symbolizes abundance and the complete defeat of the enemy. It reflects the totality of God's judgment, where nothing is left undone. This imagery also connects to the eschatological banquet described in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where God provides a feast for all peoples, symbolizing salvation and victory.<p><b>and drink blood until you are drunk</b><br>Drinking blood is forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), making this imagery particularly striking. It underscores the severity and completeness of God's judgment against the nations opposing Israel. The act of drinking blood until drunk signifies overwhelming victory and the utter destruction of the enemies. This phrase also echoes the apocalyptic imagery found in <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>, where a similar feast is prepared for the birds to consume the flesh of kings and mighty men, symbolizing the final defeat of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Every phrase&#8212;God preparing the sacrifice, creatures gorging on fat, and drinking blood to excess&#8212;highlights His total sovereignty, the completeness of judgment, and the public vindication of His holiness. The graphic language is not mere symbolism; it assures believers that the Lord will utterly defeat evil, glorify His name among the nations, and protect His people forever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the sacrifice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(miz&#183;zi&#7687;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2077.htm">Strong's 2077: </a> </span><span class="str2">A slaughter, the flesh of an animal, a sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am preparing,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7687;a&#7717;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2076.htm">Strong's 2076: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slaughter for sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;tem-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#234;&#183;le&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2459.htm">Strong's 2459: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fat, richest, choice part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until you are gorged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7654.htm">Strong's 7654: </a> </span><span class="str2">Satiety</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and drink</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8354.htm">Strong's 8354: </a> </span><span class="str2">To imbibe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">blood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until you are drunk.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;ik&#183;k&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7943.htm">Strong's 7943: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intoxication</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/39-19.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 39:19 You shall eat fat until you be (Ezek.
