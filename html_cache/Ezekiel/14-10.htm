In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were being held accountable for their idolatry and rebellion against God. The concept of bearing one's punishment is consistent with the biblical principle that each person is responsible for their own sin (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). This reflects the justice of God, who ensures that each individual faces the consequences of their actions.<p><b>the punishment of the inquirer</b><br>The "inquirer" refers to those who seek guidance from false prophets or idols instead of turning to God. In ancient Israel, consulting false prophets was a common practice, often leading people away from the truth of God's word. This phrase highlights the danger of seeking spiritual guidance from sources that do not align with God's truth. It serves as a warning to remain faithful to God's revelation and not be led astray by false teachings.<p><b>will be the same as that of the prophet</b><br>This indicates that both the false prophet and the one who seeks their counsel will face the same judgment. It underscores the seriousness of leading others astray and the shared culpability between the deceiver and the deceived. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against false prophets and teachers (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15-20</a>). It also points to the importance of discernment and the responsibility of believers to test all teachings against the truth of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic acts.
