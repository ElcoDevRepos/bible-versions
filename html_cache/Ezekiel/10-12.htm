In biblical symbolism, the body often represents the whole being, suggesting that these creatures are entirely devoted to their divine mission. The cherubim are frequently associated with the presence and glory of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>.<p><b>including their backs, hands, and wings</b><br>The mention of specific body parts highlights the multifaceted nature of the cherubim's abilities and functions. The back may symbolize strength and support, the hands represent action and service, and the wings signify swiftness and the ability to ascend to the divine realm. Wings are often associated with divine protection and mobility, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>.<p><b>were full of eyes all around</b><br>Eyes symbolize awareness, knowledge, and vigilance.
