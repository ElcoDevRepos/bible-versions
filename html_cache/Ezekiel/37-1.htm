In the Old Testament, the "hand of the LORD" often signifies God's power and presence guiding a prophet. This is seen in other prophetic books, such as in <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a> with Elijah. It underscores the authority and authenticity of Ezekiel's vision, emphasizing that the message is not from human origin but from God Himself.<p><b>and He brought me out by His Spirit</b><br>The Spirit of God is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, symbolizing divine guidance and revelation. The Spirit's role in transporting Ezekiel highlights the supernatural nature of the vision. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where the Spirit leads, such as in <a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a> with Philip. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in believers' lives.<p><b>and set me down in the middle of the valley</b><br>The valley represents a place of desolation and death, contrasting with the mountains often associated with divine encounters. This setting is significant as it reflects the dire situation of Israel in exile. Valleys in biblical literature can symbolize low points or challenges, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, "the valley of the shadow of death."<p><b>and it was full of bones</b><br>The bones symbolize the house of Israel, as later explained in the chapter. They represent the spiritual and national death of the people due to exile and disobedience. This imagery is powerful, evoking the idea of hopelessness and the need for divine intervention. The vision of dry bones is a prophetic metaphor for resurrection and restoration, pointing to God's promise to revive and restore His people. This theme of resurrection is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who brings life to what was once dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this vision.

The prophet is not acting on impulse; God initiates everything.<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we understand this as a real, transformative experience, not a mere feeling. God still places His hand on servants today (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>), empowering them for tasks beyond their strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He brought me out by His Spirit</b><p>&#8226; The Spirit personally transports Ezekiel, just as He later whisks Philip from the desert road to Azotus (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>).<p>&#8226; This leading is deliberate: &#8220;For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that prophetic ministry flows from the Spirit, never human ingenuity (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the progression: God&#8217;s hand commissions, God&#8217;s Spirit conveys. Every step is divinely choreographed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set me down in the middle of the valley</b><p>&#8226; Previously Ezekiel saw God&#8217;s glory by the Kebar River (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>); now he is placed at ground level among ruins.<p>&#8226; Valleys in Scripture often picture testing or battlefields (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="/joel/3-14.htm">Joel 3:14</a>). Here the valley will become a stage for resurrection power.<p>&#8226; The exact placement &#8220;in the middle&#8221; ensures Ezekiel sees the full extent of devastation&#8212;no optimistic angle hides the reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it was full of bones</b><p>&#8226; Not scattered remains of a few but &#8220;full,&#8221; stressing complete national death&#8212;Israel in exile with no human hope (<a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Bones symbolize finality; flesh and sinew have long vanished. Similar imagery of utter desolation appears in <a href="/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1&#8211;2</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet God often starts renewal where life seems impossible (<a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39&#8211;44</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>).

After the prophet's mind had so long dwelt upon the desolating campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar, these ghastly reminders of the loss of human life might naturally enter into his thoughts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord was upon me</span>. The absence of the customary "and" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1, 3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14, 22</a>), wanting only once again (<a href="/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), appears to indicate something extraordinary and unusual in the prophet's experience. In the words of Ewald, such a never-beheld sight one sees freely (by itself) in a moment of higher inspiration or never;" and that in this whole vision the prophet was the subject of a special and intensified inspiration is evident, not alone from the contents of the vision, but also from the language in which it is recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord.</span> So the Vulgate and Hitzig - a translation which Smend thinks might be justified by an appeal to <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, in which the similar phrase, "Spirit of God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>)," occurs; though, with Grotius, Havernick, Keil, and others, he prefers the rendering of the LXX., "And Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit." The Revised Version combines the two thus: "And he carried me out in the Spirit of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>." Keil suggests that the words, "of God," in <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, were omitted here because of the word "Jehovah" immediately following. <span class="cmt_word">And set me down in the midst of the valley.</span> As the article indicates, the valley in the neighborhood of Tel-Abib, where the prophet received his first instructions concerning his mission (<a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>); although Hengstenberg holds, wrongly we think, that "the valley here has nothing to do with the valley in <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>." <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was full of bones</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of men who had been slaughtered there (ver. 9; comp. <a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>), and whose corpses had been left unburied upon the face of the plain (ver. 3), so that they were seen by the prophet. Whether these bones were actually in the valley, or merely formed part of the vision, can only be conjectured, though the latter opinion seems the more probable. At the same time, such a plain as is here depicted may well have been a battle-ground on which Assyrian and Chaldean armies had often met. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">upon me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
