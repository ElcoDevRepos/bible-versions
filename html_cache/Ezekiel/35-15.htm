Historically, Edom and Israel had a tumultuous relationship, rooted in the sibling rivalry between Esau (ancestor of the Edomites) and Jacob (ancestor of the Israelites). The "inheritance of the house of Israel" refers to the Promised Land, which became desolate due to invasions and exile. Edom's rejoicing is condemned as it reflects a lack of compassion and brotherly love, contrary to the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>so will I do to you</b><br>This is a declaration of divine retribution. The principle of "measure for measure" is evident here, where Edom's actions towards Israel will be mirrored back upon them. This reflects the biblical theme of justice, where God holds nations accountable for their actions (<a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>). It underscores the idea that God is sovereign and just, ensuring that those who harm His people will face consequences.<p><b>You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir</b><br>Mount Seir is the mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites. The prophecy of desolation is a direct response to Edom's actions and attitudes. Archaeological evidence shows that Edom was indeed a significant kingdom, but it eventually faced decline and destruction, fulfilling this prophecy. The desolation serves as a warning to all nations about the consequences of opposing God's people.<p><b>and so will all of Edom</b><br>This expands the judgment from Mount Seir to the entire nation of Edom. Historically, Edom was known for its strategic location and trade routes, but its downfall was prophesied due to its enmity with Israel. The complete desolation of Edom is a testament to the fulfillment of God's word and serves as a reminder of the fate of those who oppose His plans.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ultimate purpose of God's judgments: to reveal His sovereignty and identity. Throughout the Bible, God's actions are often intended to demonstrate His power and authority, leading people to acknowledge Him as the one true God (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>). This acknowledgment is not just for Edom but serves as a universal call to recognize God's dominion over all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Instead of this Greek term, the Revised Version properly substitutes the usual word Edom. Note: That the prediction here uttered concerning Edom received literal fulfillment, the following extract relative to the present state of the country will show: "Idumea, once so rich in flocks, so strong in its fortresses and rock-hewn cities, so extensive in its commercial relations, so renowned for the architectural splendor of its palaces, is now a deserted and desolate wilderness. Its whole population is contained in some three or four miserable villages. No merchant would now dare to enter its borders; its highways are untrodden, its cities are all in ruins" (J.L.
