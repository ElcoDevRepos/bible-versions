It serves as a symbol of pride and power in the biblical narrative. The reference to Assyria in this passage highlights its former glory and might, which is now being used as a cautionary tale. Historically, Assyria was a significant threat to Israel and Judah, often seen as an instrument of God's judgment. The mention of Assyria here sets the stage for a comparison with Egypt, as both nations were known for their strength and influence.<p><b>a cedar in Lebanon</b><br>The cedar tree is a symbol of strength, longevity, and majesty. Lebanon was famous for its high-quality cedar trees, which were used in the construction of significant buildings, including Solomon's Temple. The imagery of a cedar in Lebanon conveys the idea of something that is both grand and enduring. In biblical literature, cedars often represent powerful nations or leaders. This metaphor emphasizes Assyria's former greatness and the respect it commanded among other nations.<p><b>with beautiful branches that shaded the forest</b><br>The beautiful branches suggest prosperity and influence, as the tree provides shelter and protection. This imagery can be seen as a representation of Assyria's ability to dominate and provide for the regions under its control. The forest being shaded implies that other nations or peoples were under Assyria's influence or protection, highlighting its role as a superpower of the time. This phrase underscores the extent of Assyria's reach and the impact it had on the surrounding regions.<p><b>It towered on high</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the height and grandeur of Assyria, symbolizing its supremacy and dominance over other nations. The towering height can also be seen as a metaphor for pride and arrogance, traits often associated with powerful empires in biblical texts. The imagery of height is frequently used in the Bible to denote authority and preeminence, as well as the potential for downfall due to hubris.<p><b>its top was among the clouds</b><br>The top being among the clouds suggests an aspiration to reach divine heights, reflecting Assyria's ambition and self-exaltation. This imagery can be linked to the Tower of Babel narrative, where humanity's attempt to reach the heavens led to divine intervention and judgment. In a prophetic sense, this phrase warns of the dangers of pride and the eventual judgment that comes to those who elevate themselves above their rightful place. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all nations, regardless of their perceived power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful ancient empire known for its military might and extensive conquests.

The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of "Thou art the man!" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), or the <span class="accented">mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur</span> of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (<span class="accented">Tasshur</span> for <span class="accented">Asshur</span>), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The "cedar in Lebanon" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in <a href="/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The shadowing shroud</span> may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. <span class="cmt_word">His top was among the thick boughs</span>; better, <span class="accented">clouds, as</span> in the margin of the Revised Version.
