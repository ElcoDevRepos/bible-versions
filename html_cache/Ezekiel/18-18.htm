In the context of ancient Israel, this was a significant departure from the belief that children could suffer for their parents' sins, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. Ezekiel's message aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that individuals are accountable for their own actions. This principle is foundational in understanding God's justice and fairness, as each person is judged according to their deeds.<p><b>because he practiced extortion</b><br>Extortion, in biblical terms, refers to the unjust taking of goods or money through force or threats. This was a common issue in ancient societies, including Israel, where leaders and those in power often exploited the vulnerable. The Mosaic Law explicitly condemned such practices (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). The father's guilt in this context highlights the broader societal corruption that Ezekiel often addressed, calling for repentance and a return to righteousness.<p><b>robbed his brother</b><br>Robbery, especially against one's own kin, was a grave sin in Israelite culture, violating the commandment "You shall not steal" (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). This act not only broke the law but also disrupted the social and familial harmony that was crucial in tribal communities. The emphasis on "brother" underscores the betrayal and moral decay present in the society Ezekiel was addressing, where even familial bonds were not respected.<p><b>and did what was wrong among his people</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the father's general pattern of sinful behavior, affecting the community at large. In the prophetic literature, the actions of individuals often reflect the spiritual state of the nation. Ezekiel's ministry was during a time of great moral and spiritual decline in Judah, leading to the Babylonian exile. The father's wrongdoing serves as a microcosm of the larger issues facing the people, calling them to repentance and a return to God's statutes. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of personal accountability before God, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents an individual who has committed sins such as extortion and robbery, highlighting the theme of personal accountability for one's actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's message, who were in exile and needed to understand the importance of individual responsibility and righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time when the Israelites were in captivity due to their collective disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Refers to the moral wrongdoing and sin that leads to spiritual and sometimes physical death, emphasizing the consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and cannot blame others for their sins.
