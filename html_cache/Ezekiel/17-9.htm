Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's message to the people, underscoring the divine authority behind the prophecy. This reflects the biblical theme of God communicating His will through chosen individuals, as seen with other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>Will it flourish?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the expectations of prosperity for the vine, symbolizing the kingdom of Judah. The imagery of flourishing is often used in Scripture to denote blessing and growth, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>. Here, it questions the false hope of success without God's favor.<p><b>Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it shrivels?</b><br>The imagery of uprooting and stripping fruit signifies judgment and destruction. In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the impending downfall of Judah due to its rebellion against God. The vine's shriveling represents the loss of vitality and prosperity, akin to the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience.<p><b>All its foliage will wither!</b><br>Withering foliage symbolizes the complete desolation and loss of life. This reflects the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in the withering fig tree in <a href="/mark/11-20.htm">Mark 11:20-21</a>, which Jesus uses as a metaphor for spiritual barrenness.<p><b>It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by its roots.</b><br>This phrase highlights the ease with which God can execute judgment. Despite human efforts to secure their own strength and alliances, as Judah did with Egypt, divine intervention requires neither a large force nor great effort. This echoes the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and power, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>, where Jonathan acknowledges that the Lord can save "by many or by few."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel, emphasizing His control over nations and their destinies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine.htm">The Vine</a></b><br>Symbolic of the kingdom of Judah, which is under judgment for its unfaithfulness and political alliances contrary to God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah and took its people into exile, representing God's instrument of judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who broke his covenant with Babylon, leading to the kingdom's downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and their leaders.

<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>- By commanding Ezekiel to speak, God models how believers today must declare His Word without alteration (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the Lord GOD says</b><p>- Every syllable carries divine authority; the covenant-keeping Yahweh stands behind the prediction (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>- Because the speaker is &#8220;the Lord GOD,&#8221; resistance is futile and obedience is wise (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>- The phrase underlines that Scripture itself&#8212;not human opinion&#8212;defines reality (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will it flourish?</b><p>- The rhetorical question expects a firm &#8220;No.&#8221; God is exposing Judah&#8217;s false optimism that rebellion against Babylon (and thus against God&#8217;s decree) could somehow succeed (<a href="/jeremiah/37-9.htm">Jeremiah 37:9-10</a>).<p>- True flourishing belongs to those planted by the Lord (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>); those who rip themselves from His soil wither (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>).<p>- The image confronts self-reliance and calls the reader to trust God&#8217;s planting rather than human schemes (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it shrivels?</b><p>- &#8220;Uprooted&#8221;

God Himself orders its uprooting, stripping, withering, and easy removal. Every phrase underscores His absolute authority, the futility of self-reliance, and the certainty that what He plants thrives while what He opposes collapses. Trusting and obeying His Word remain the only path to lasting flourishing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Of her spring.</span>--Our translators probably intended by this word, as they evidently did in <a href="/psalms/65-10.htm" title="You water the ridges thereof abundantly: you settle the furrows thereof: you make it soft with showers: you bless the springing thereof.">Psalm 65:10</a>, "her springing forth," her growth; but it would be' better now to substitute the word <span class= "ital">growth,</span><p><span class= "bld">Pluck it up by the roots.</span>--The word here is a different one from the "pull up "in the earlier part of the verse, and has rather the sense of raise up from the roots." The whole clause would be better translated, "not <span class= "ital">even </span>with great power and many people is it to be raised up from its roots again." The meaning is explained in <a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:">Ezekiel 17:17</a>, that the strength of Pharaoh would be utterly insufficient to restore the people whom God had blighted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The prophet, like his contemporary Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>), like his predecessor Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), is against this policy of an Egyptian alliance. The question which he asks, as the prophet of Jehovah, implies an answer in the negative. The doom of failure was written on all such projects.
