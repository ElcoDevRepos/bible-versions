In biblical context, shepherds were responsible for the well-being of their flock, symbolizing leaders' duty to care for their people. The weak here can be seen as those who are spiritually, emotionally, or physically frail. This neglect contrasts with God's character, who is described as a shepherd in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, providing strength and guidance.<p><b>healed the sick</b><br>The leaders' failure to heal the sick reflects a lack of compassion and care. In ancient Israel, sickness often symbolized spiritual or moral decay. Healing was a sign of divine intervention and care, as seen in the ministry of Jesus, who healed many as a demonstration of God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>). The leaders' neglect is a stark contrast to the healing ministry of Christ.<p><b>bound up the injured</b><br>Binding up the injured refers to tending to those who are wounded, both physically and spiritually. In the cultural context, shepherds would bind the wounds of their sheep, symbolizing care and restoration. This imagery is used in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is prophesied to bind up the brokenhearted, pointing to Jesus' mission of restoration.<p><b>brought back the strays</b><br>This phrase indicates a failure to seek out those who have wandered away. In biblical times, straying sheep were vulnerable to predators, symbolizing those who have drifted from the faith. Jesus' parable of the lost sheep (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>) illustrates God's heart for bringing back the lost, contrasting with the leaders' negligence.<p><b>or searched for the lost</b><br>Searching for the lost involves actively seeking those who are missing or have gone astray. This reflects God's pursuit of humanity, as seen in Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The leaders' failure to search for the lost shows a lack of concern for the spiritual well-being of their people.<p><b>Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty</b><br>This phrase condemns the leaders for their harsh and oppressive rule. Violence and cruelty are antithetical to the shepherding role, which should be characterized by care and protection. This behavior is reminiscent of the oppressive rulers criticized by the prophets (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>). In contrast, Jesus is depicted as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), embodying the opposite of violence and cruelty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds_of_israel.htm">Shepherds of Israel</a></b><br>Metaphorically refers to the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_weak,_sick,_injured,_strays,_and_lost.htm">The Weak, Sick, Injured, Strays, and Lost</a></b><br>Represents the vulnerable and neglected members of the community who were not cared for by their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time when Israel was in captivity due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The event of God holding the leaders accountable for their failure to care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_leadership.htm">Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for the care and well-being of those they lead.
