In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, God is addressing the shepherds of Israel, who have failed in their duty to care for the flock. The imagery of shoving with flank and shoulder suggests a forceful and selfish attitude, prioritizing their own needs over the welfare of the weaker members of the community. This behavior is condemned as it reflects a lack of compassion and responsibility, which are essential qualities of a true shepherd. The metaphor of sheep and shepherds is common in the Bible, with leaders often depicted as shepherds responsible for the well-being of their people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>).<p><b>butting all the weak ones with your horns</b><br>The use of "butting" with horns further emphasizes the aggressive and harmful actions of the leaders. Horns in biblical symbolism often represent strength and power (e.g., <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>). Here, the leaders are using their power to harm rather than protect, targeting the weak and vulnerable. This behavior is contrary to the biblical mandate for leaders to defend and support those who are powerless (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). The weak ones represent those in society who are marginalized or oppressed, and the leaders' actions are a direct violation of their duty to serve and uplift these individuals.<p><b>until you have scattered them abroad</b><br>The result of the leaders' actions is the scattering of the flock, which signifies disunity and vulnerability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a scattered flock was at risk of predation and lacked the protection and guidance of a shepherd. This scattering is symbolic of the spiritual and social disintegration of Israel due to the negligence and abuse of its leaders. The scattering of God's people is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with judgment and exile (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>). However, it also sets the stage for God's promise of restoration and gathering, as seen later in <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>, where God promises to set up one shepherd, a prophecy often interpreted as pointing to Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd who gathers and cares for His flock (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The Lord exposes intentional exploitation (<a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>; <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; By describing the sin so graphically, God makes clear that abuse of authority offends Him as surely as idolatry or immorality. Scripture repeatedly warns shepherds to feed the flock, not themselves (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>butting all the weak ones with your horns</b><p>&#8226; Horns symbolize power (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>).

Jesus later confronts the same attitude in the Pharisees who &#8220;tie up heavy burdens&#8221; and &#8220;devour widows&#8217; houses&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4, 14</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord promises to &#8220;bind up the injured and strengthen the weak&#8221; Himself (<a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>).
