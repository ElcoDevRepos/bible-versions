In ancient Israel, high places were locations where people would offer sacrifices and engage in religious ceremonies, often contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The prohibition against eating at the mountain underscores the importance of exclusive devotion to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, where God commands the Israelites to destroy such places. This reflects a call to purity and separation from pagan practices.<p><b>or look to the idols of the house of Israel</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel's history, leading to spiritual adultery against God. The "idols of the house of Israel" indicates that these were not foreign gods but those adopted by the Israelites themselves, such as the golden calves in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>. The prophets frequently condemned this practice, emphasizing the need for repentance and return to the worship of the one true God. This phrase highlights the internal corruption and the need for reform within the community of Israel.<p><b>He does not defile his neighbor&#8217;s wife</b><br>Adultery is explicitly condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>) and is seen as a serious breach of covenantal faithfulness, not only to one's spouse but also to God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was a sacred covenant, and violating it was tantamount to breaking faith with God. This phrase underscores the importance of personal integrity and faithfulness in relationships, reflecting God's own faithfulness to His people.<p><b>or approach a woman during her period</b><br>This prohibition is rooted in the Levitical laws concerning ritual purity (<a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19, 20</a>:18). In the ancient Near Eastern context, such laws were given to maintain the holiness of the community and to set Israel apart from surrounding nations. The emphasis on purity and holiness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, pointing to the need for a people consecrated to God.
