These beings are often associated with the presence and glory of God, as seen in other biblical passages such as <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>. Their movement signifies the active presence and dynamic nature of God's will and purpose.<p><b>I heard the sound of their wings</b><br>The sound of the wings indicates the power and majesty of these creatures. Wings in biblical literature often symbolize swiftness and divine protection, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>. The auditory imagery emphasizes the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of the divine presence.<p><b>like the roar of many waters</b><br>This simile draws a parallel to the sound of rushing waters, a common biblical metaphor for God's voice and power, as seen in <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. The imagery suggests an overwhelming, majestic, and irresistible force, reflecting the grandeur and authority of God.<p><b>like the voice of the Almighty</b><br>The comparison to the voice of the Almighty underscores the divine origin and authority of the sound. In the Old Testament, God's voice is often depicted as powerful and commanding, as in <a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>. This phrase reinforces the idea that the creatures are closely associated with God's presence and His sovereign will.<p><b>like the tumult of an army</b><br>This imagery conveys the idea of organized power and might, reminiscent of the Lord of Hosts, a title for God that emphasizes His command over heavenly and earthly armies. The tumult of an army suggests both the order and the overwhelming strength of God's forces, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>.<p><b>When they stood still, they lowered their wings</b><br>The lowering of the wings signifies a moment of reverence and stillness in the presence of God. This action can be seen as a form of worship or submission, reflecting the creatures' acknowledgment of God's supreme authority. The stillness contrasts with the previous movement, highlighting the creatures' obedience and readiness to act according to God's command.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings described in Ezekiel's vision, characterized by their wings and their role as attendants to the divine presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_almighty.htm">The Almighty</a></b><br>A reference to God, whose voice is compared to the sound of the cherubim's wings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Ezekiel received his visions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_four_living_creatures.htm">The Vision of the Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>A significant event in Ezekiel's prophetic ministry, symbolizing God's glory and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_presence.htm">The Majesty of God's Presence</a></b><br>The sound of the cherubim's wings reflects the overwhelming majesty and power of God's presence.

Their movement shouts purpose&#8212;God&#8217;s purpose. Just as the pillar of cloud directed Israel (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), these creatures demonstrate that heaven&#8217;s throne is anything but static. Every pivot announces that God is actively steering history, not observing it from a distance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I heard the sound of their wings</b><p>Sight alone cannot capture God&#8217;s glory, so the prophet&#8217;s ears are enlisted. At Isaiah&#8217;s vision, the seraphim caused the temple thresholds to shake (<a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>). Likewise here, sound underscores reality: what Ezekiel experiences is no dream but a tangible encounter with divine beings whose very motion fills the air.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the roar of many waters</b><p>Picture standing beside a massive waterfall: the thunder drowns out every lesser noise. In Scripture, that overwhelming rush often signals the presence of God Himself&#8212;&#8220;the voice of the LORD is over the waters&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-4</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>). The wings echo that same majesty, testifying that the throne Ezekiel sees (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>) commands all creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the voice of the Almighty</b><p>The comparison leaps from created wonder to Creator. When God spoke at Sinai, the people trembled (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18-19</a>). Job heard &#8220;thunderous&#8221; words (<a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>). So the creatures&#8217; roar mirrors, not rivals, the Almighty&#8217;s voice, reminding us that angelic power is derivative. They carry God&#8217;s authority, never their own (<a href="/psalms/68-33.htm">Psalm 68:33</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the tumult of an army</b><p>The imagery now shifts to disciplined might. Think of the synchronized march in <a href="/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5-11</a> or the invading force in <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>&#8212;unstoppable, unified. Heaven&#8217;s host is no scattered crowd; it is an ordered army executing the King&#8217;s commands. The living creatures stand as the front ranks of that host, reinforcing God&#8217;s sovereignty over every earthly military power (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they stood still</b><p>Motion halts instantly at the divine signal. Ezekiel notes elsewhere, &#8220;When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a>). Their responsiveness models perfect obedience. Stillness here is not inactivity but attentive readiness, a reminder that sometimes God&#8217;s will is to wait (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They lowered their wings</b><p>Lowered wings signify reverence and rest. In <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> the seraphim covered themselves in worship; <a href="/revelation/5-14.htm">Revelation 5:14</a> shows heavenly beings falling before the throne. For Ezekiel, the gesture says, &#8220;Mission accomplished until the next command.&#8221; It invites believers to balance fervent service with humble submission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a> paints an audio portrait of heaven&#8217;s order: powerful, majestic, and utterly obedient. The living creatures&#8217; wings roar like waterfalls, thunder with God&#8217;s own voice, and surge like a vast army&#8212;yet they can freeze in silent humility. The verse calls us to marvel at God&#8217;s unmatched authority and to imitate the creatures&#8217; example: move when He moves, stand when He says stand, and worship throughout.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The noise of their wings.</span>--The same word translated "noise" three times in this verse is also translated "voice" twice here, and once in the next verse. It is better to keep <span class= "ital">voice </span>throughout. "I heard the voice of their wings, like the voice of many waters." The same comparison is used to describe the voice of God in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>. Further attempts to convey an impression of the effect are :--" As the voice of the Almighty," by which thunder is often described in Scripture (<a href="/context/job/37-4.htm" title="After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.">Job 37:4-5</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/29-3.htm" title="The voice of the LORD is on the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD is on many waters.">Psalm 29:3-4</a>); "the voice of speech," by which is not to be understood articulate language. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>, and is there translated <span class= "ital">a tumult. </span>The idea conveyed by the word is probably that of the confused sound from a great multitude, and, finally, "as the voice of an host." All these comparisons concur in representing a vast and terrible sound, but inarticulate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of their wings,</span> etc. The wings representing the soaring, ascending elements in nature, their motion answers to its aspirations, their sounds to its inarticulate groanings (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>) or its chorus of praise. <span class="cmt_word">The noise of great waters</span> may be that of the sea, or river, or torrents.
