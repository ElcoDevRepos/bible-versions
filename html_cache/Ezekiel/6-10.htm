Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the repeated declaration "they will know that I am the LORD" serves as a central theme, underscoring God's desire for His people to acknowledge His power and holiness. This recognition often comes through judgment or deliverance, highlighting God's justice and mercy. The phrase echoes the covenant relationship established in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises to be their God and they His people, reinforcing the idea that true knowledge of God involves understanding His character and His rightful place as the sovereign ruler.<p><b>I did not declare in vain</b><br>This part of the verse assures that God's warnings and prophecies are purposeful and certain. In the context of Ezekiel, God had repeatedly warned Israel through His prophets about the consequences of their idolatry and disobedience. The phrase suggests that God's words are not empty threats but are meant to bring about repentance and transformation. It reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires and achieving the purpose for which He sent it.<p><b>that I would bring this calamity upon them.</b><br>The calamity refers to the impending judgment on Israel due to their persistent sin and rebellion. Historically, this judgment manifested in the Babylonian exile, a significant event where Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people were taken captive. This calamity serves as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience would lead to national disaster. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine justice. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Christ, who bore the calamity of sin on behalf of humanity, offering restoration and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who declares judgment and promises restoration, emphasizing His authority and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/calamity.htm">Calamity</a></b><br>The judgment and destruction prophesied by God as a consequence of Israel's persistent idolatry and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's declarations are never in vain; His words are powerful and purposeful.

To "labour in vain" is the great misery of all workers for God. A time will come when he shall see that God has not sent him to such a work "in vain." What before was dark will be made clear unto him (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>). Ezekiel's words, "not in vain," are echoed frequently by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 58</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). The corresponding phrase, "I have broken their eyes," sounds strange to us; but, after all, the heart is not literally broken more than the eyes, and figuratively the same words may be applied to either, so that there is no need for supposing, with some critics, that a more appropriate verb has been dropped out. Eyes and heart were alike involved in the sin (<a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8, 24</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>), and both came under the same chastisement that was to lead them to repentance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they will know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
