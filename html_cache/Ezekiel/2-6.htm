The command "do not be afraid" is a divine reassurance, common in Scripture when God calls someone to a difficult task (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). The "them" refers to the rebellious Israelites, who were often resistant to prophetic messages. This phrase underscores the prophet's need for courage in the face of opposition, a theme echoed in the New Testament when Jesus instructs His disciples not to fear persecution (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p><b>Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns surround you, and you dwell among scorpions.</b><br>"Briers and thorns" symbolize the hostility and resistance Ezekiel would face. These terms are reminiscent of the curse in <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, representing the consequences of sin. "Scorpions" further intensify the imagery, suggesting danger and pain. In a spiritual sense, these elements highlight the prophet's challenging environment, akin to the trials faced by believers who stand for truth in a fallen world. This imagery is also prophetic of the suffering and rejection Jesus would endure (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>Do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their presence, though they are a rebellious house.</b><br>The repetition of "do not be afraid" emphasizes the importance of steadfastness. "Their words" likely include mockery and threats, common reactions to prophetic messages (<a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>). "Dismayed by their presence" suggests the intimidating nature of the opposition. The term "rebellious house" characterizes Israel's persistent disobedience, a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>). This rebellion foreshadows the rejection of Christ by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>), yet also points to the ultimate hope of redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
