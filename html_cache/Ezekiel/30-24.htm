In the biblical context, God often uses foreign nations as instruments of His judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The "arms" symbolize military power and might, suggesting that Babylon's military campaigns will be successful. Historically, Babylon was a dominant power in the ancient Near East, and its rise was part of God's plan to discipline nations, including Judah and Egypt.<p><b>and place My sword in his hand</b><br>The "sword" represents God's judgment and authority. By placing His sword in the hand of Babylon's king, God is delegating His authority to execute judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God uses nations as His instruments of wrath (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). The sword also signifies the inevitability of Babylon's conquest over Egypt, fulfilling God's prophetic word.<p><b>but I will break the arms of Pharaoh</b><br>In contrast to strengthening Babylon, God declares He will weaken Pharaoh, symbolizing Egypt's impending defeat. The "arms" here again represent military strength, and breaking them indicates a loss of power and capability. Historically, Egypt was a significant power, but its influence waned during this period. This act of breaking Pharaoh's arms is a demonstration of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19:1-4</a>.<p><b>who will groan before him like a mortally wounded man</b><br>This vivid imagery portrays Pharaoh's helplessness and suffering in the face of Babylon's assault. The groaning of a mortally wounded man suggests agony and defeat, emphasizing the totality of Egypt's downfall. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on prideful nations (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>). The phrase underscores the futility of opposing God's will, as seen in the fate of other nations throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Jewish exiles in Babylon.
