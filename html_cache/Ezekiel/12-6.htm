This public demonstration serves as a visual prophecy, a common method used by prophets to capture attention and communicate divine truths. The act of watching signifies the people's awareness and the inevitability of the coming judgment.<p><b>lift your bags to your shoulder</b><br>This action symbolizes the impending exile of the Israelites. The bags represent the necessities for a journey, indicating that the people will soon be forced to leave their homeland. This imagery is reminiscent of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, highlighting a recurring theme of displacement due to disobedience.<p><b>and take them out at dusk</b><br>The timing of dusk suggests secrecy and urgency, reflecting the suddenness of the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent exile. Dusk, a time of transition from light to darkness, symbolizes the impending judgment and the loss of divine favor. This also connects to the theme of darkness as a metaphor for God's judgment throughout scripture.<p><b>cover your face so that you cannot see the land</b><br>Covering the face signifies shame and mourning, as well as the loss of identity and connection to the land. It also indicates the blindness of the people to their spiritual state and the consequences of their actions. This act foreshadows the complete removal from the land, a punishment for their idolatry and rebellion.<p><b>For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.</b><br>Ezekiel himself becomes a living symbol of the message he delivers. This prophetic sign is a direct communication from God, emphasizing the seriousness of the warning. The house of Israel refers to the entire nation, underscoring the collective responsibility and the widespread impact of their disobedience. This concept of a prophet as a sign is seen in other biblical figures, such as Isaiah and Hosea, who also embodied their messages through symbolic actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Yet even in stern discipline, the LORD graciously provides a clear, public sign so His people may turn back before the darkness fully falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Bear it . . . carry it.</span>--The pronouns are not in the original, and are better omitted. Otherwise, the "it" might seem to refer to the stuff already carried out during the day. Read, "Thou shalt bear upon thy shoulders, and carry forth in the dark." The word rendered "twilight" is used only here and in <a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm" title="And the prince that is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.">Ezekiel 12:12</a>, and in <a href="/genesis/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.">Genesis 15:17</a>, and means <span class= "ital">dark.</span><p><span class= "bld">That thou see not the ground.</span>--This covering of the face might primarily be a token of grief; but as the whole action is distinctly prophetic (and is so interpreted; see <a href="/context/ezekiel/12-11.htm" title="Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove and go into captivity.">Ezekiel 12:11-14</a>), so especially was this sign. (See the account of the capture of Zedekiah in <a href="/context/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2Kings 25:4-7</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4-7</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/52-7.htm" title="Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 52:7-11</a>.) The king, with his men of war, escaped from the city secretly by night, was pursued and captured, and carried to Riblah, where his eyes were put out, and he was then taken in chains to Babylon. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as they look on,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
