The land holds significant covenantal importance, as it was promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The prophecy underscores God's ongoing relationship with Israel despite their exile and judgment. The land is not just a physical territory but a symbol of God's promises and faithfulness.<p><b>and tell the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys,</b><br>The mention of geographical features emphasizes the totality of the land. Mountains and hills often symbolize strength and permanence in biblical literature, while ravines and valleys can represent vulnerability and low points. This comprehensive address signifies that God's message is for the entire land, reflecting its restoration and future blessing. It also echoes the language of creation, where all elements of nature are called to witness God's actions (<a href="/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a>).<p><b>that this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority of the message, coming directly from the sovereign Lord. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) highlights both His lordship and covenantal name, emphasizing His power and faithfulness. It assures the audience that the prophecy is not from human origin but divine, demanding attention and reverence.<p><b>Behold, I have spoken in My burning zeal</b><br>God's "burning zeal" reflects His passionate commitment to His people and His land. This zeal is often associated with God's holiness and righteousness, driving Him to act against sin and injustice (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). It conveys the intensity of God's emotions and His determination to restore Israel, contrasting with His previous judgments due to their disobedience.<p><b>because you have endured the reproach of the nations.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the suffering and humiliation Israel faced from surrounding nations. Historically, Israel's exile and the destruction of Jerusalem led to scorn and derision from other peoples (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>). The reproach signifies both the consequences of Israel's sin and the nations' misunderstanding of God's purposes. God's response in zeal indicates His intention to vindicate His name and His people, promising restoration and honor (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
