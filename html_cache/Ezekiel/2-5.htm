It reflects the consistent biblical theme of human responsibility and accountability. In the context of Ezekiel's ministry, it underscores the prophet's role as a messenger, regardless of the people's reaction. This echoes the call of other prophets, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>), who were also sent to a people who might not heed their warnings. The phrase suggests the inevitability of divine truth being proclaimed, irrespective of human acceptance.<p><b>for they are a rebellious house</b><br>The term "rebellious house" refers to the Israelites, who had a history of disobedience and idolatry. This rebellion is documented throughout the Old Testament, notably during the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>) and the period of the judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The phrase indicates a hardened spiritual state, which necessitated prophetic intervention. It also foreshadows the eventual judgment and exile that would come upon the nation due to their persistent rebellion.<p><b>they will know that a prophet has been among them</b><br>This statement assures that the presence of a true prophet, like Ezekiel, would be undeniable, even if the people chose not to listen. It implies that the fulfillment of prophetic words would serve as a testament to the authenticity of the prophet's message. This is seen in the eventual fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecies concerning the fall of Jerusalem and the exile. The phrase also points to the role of prophets as representatives of God's authority and truth, similar to how Jesus Christ is recognized as the ultimate Prophet (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-23</a>), whose words and works testify to His divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God during the Babylonian exile to deliver His messages to the Israelites.

In the end, God will vindicate His servant and His truth, ensuring all will recognize that His prophet&#8212;and therefore His own voice&#8212;has been among them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span>--Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm" title="And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.">Ezekiel 3:11</a>. God's word remains the same whatever reception man may accord to it; it cannot return unto Him void, but must accomplish that which He pleases (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a>); just as the Apostles remained "unto God a sweet savour of Christ" alike "in them that are saved and in them that perish" (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2Corinthians 2:15-16</a>). But while the mighty power of the Divine word must thus produce its effect, the character of the effect depends upon those to whom it comes; "to the one we are a savour of death unto death, and to the other the savour of life unto life." So it would be among the captives by the Chebar: some would be brought back to their allegiance to their God, and would constitute the remnant through whom He would bless His people and the world; and some, resisting the offered grace, would be thus made more obdurate than ever. In either case, they could not remain as before. Whether for gain or for loss, they should "know that there hath been a prophet among them," by the change his ministrations should produce among them. The offer of grace, imposing the responsibility of accepting or rejecting it, ever becomes thus "a great and terrible day of the Lord." (See <a href="/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>, compared with <a href="/matthew/17-12.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.">Matthew 17:12</a>; <a href="/context/acts/2-16.htm" title="But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;">Acts 2:16-22</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</span> etc. The latter word is used in the sense of "cease" or "desist," as in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> and <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The same formula meets us in ver. 7; <a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11, 27</a>. The prophet is warned beforehand of the (at least) probable failure of his mission, wholly or in part. We note the parallelism of thought, though not language, in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>. Such, at all times, has been the condition of the prophet's work. The expectation is grounded upon the antecedent fact of their being a "rebellious people." There is the consolation that in the end, partly through the fulfilment of his words, partly, it may be, through the witness of their own conscience, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>).
