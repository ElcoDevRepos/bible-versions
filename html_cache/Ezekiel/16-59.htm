In the prophetic books, this introduction is a common formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. It is a reminder that the words spoken are not merely human opinions but are declarations from the Almighty. This phrase is used throughout the Old Testament to assert the seriousness and truth of the prophecy.<p><b>I will deal with you according to your deeds:</b><br>This statement reflects the principle of divine justice, where God responds to the actions of individuals or nations. In the context of Ezekiel, God is addressing the people of Jerusalem, who have turned away from Him. The concept of retribution according to deeds is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, which states, "A man reaps what he sows." It highlights the moral order established by God, where actions have consequences.<p><b>since you have despised the oath:</b><br>The "oath" refers to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). To despise the oath is to treat it with contempt, indicating a serious breach of faithfulness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, oaths and covenants were binding agreements, and breaking them was a grave offense. This phrase underscores the gravity of Israel's unfaithfulness and their disregard for the sacred promises made to God.<p><b>by breaking the covenant:</b><br>The covenant mentioned here is the Mosaic Covenant, which included laws, commandments, and stipulations that the Israelites were to follow. Breaking the covenant implies a violation of the terms agreed upon, leading to the loss of blessings and the imposition of curses as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This breach is not just a legal issue but a relational one, as it signifies a betrayal of the intimate relationship between God and His people. The breaking of the covenant is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting the need for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon, delivering messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, depicted in this chapter as an unfaithful wife who has broken her covenant with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred agreement between God and Israel, which Israel has violated through idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a period of judgment for Israel's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_covenant.htm">The Seriousness of Covenant</a></b><br>God's covenants are sacred and binding.

Every word that follows is guaranteed, just as Isaiah proclaimed the same certainty in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and Jeremiah in <a href="/jeremiah/33-2.htm">Jeremiah 33:2</a>. Whenever Scripture introduces God&#8217;s speech this way, He is asserting that His verdict is final, echoing <a href="/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1&#8211;2</a> where His voice alone determines blessing or judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will deal with you according to your deeds</b><p>God&#8217;s justice is always measured, personal, and precise:<p>&#8226; He weighs actions, not appearances&#8212;<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a> confirms He &#8220;rewards each man according to his conduct.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes the same principle: <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a> declare He will repay everyone &#8220;according to their deeds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In the context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, Judah&#8217;s deeds were blatant idolatry and moral corruption, graphically portrayed earlier in the chapter as spiritual prostitution. God&#8217;s response is not impulsive; it is the righteous outworking of His perfect justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since you have despised the oath</b><p>An &#8220;oath&#8221; refers to the solemn vow Israel took at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12&#8211;13</a>). Judah treated that promise as worthless, much like the treachery described in <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18&#8211;19</a>. Other prophets highlight the same sin:<p>&#8226; <a href="/nehemiah/9-38.htm">Nehemiah 9:38</a> recalls the renewed covenant oath.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a> rebukes covenant-breaking in marriage, paralleling Judah&#8217;s betrayal of God.<p>By despising the oath, they treated God&#8217;s name lightly, trampling on the sacred trust He had established.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by breaking the covenant</b><p>Breaking covenant means violating the entire relationship God initiated:<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a> laments, &#8220;Like Adam they transgressed the covenant.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> detail the curses that follow covenant breach&#8212;historical warnings now coming to pass in Ezekiel&#8217;s generation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a> shows the original promise hinged on obedience; turning to idols ruptured that bond. God&#8217;s people forfeited the blessings and opened themselves to the covenant&#8217;s disciplinary clauses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a> is God&#8217;s solemn confirmation that Judah&#8217;s unfaithfulness will be answered with divine justice. They scorned the oath and shattered the covenant, so He will repay them exactly as their deeds deserve. Yet the surrounding context (v.60) hints at mercy beyond judgment, proving that while God disciplines covenant breakers, He also remembers His covenant love. The verse therefore calls every believer to honor promises to God, trust His righteous judgments, and cling to His unwavering faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(59) <span class= "bld">In breaking the covenant.</span>--This was the especial point of the heinousness of the sin of the Jews, and the one which so greatly aggravated their guilt.

She must suffer as though it no longer existed. She must "dree her weird" and "accept her punishment" (<a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>). And then Jehovah would show that he had not really been unmindful of his part in it. He bad remained faithful in spite of her unfaithfulness. And so in the day of her repentance he will not only renew it, but will give it a higher and more permanent character. The "new covenant" of which Ezekiel's master had spoken (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) should not be as the old, decaying and vanishing away, but should be foreverlasting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I will deal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
