The concept of a "covenant of peace" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with the Messianic age. It echoes the promises found in <a href="/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God speaks of a new covenant characterized by peace and internal transformation. Historically, covenants were binding agreements, and this divine covenant signifies God's commitment to His people, ensuring their security and well-being.<p><b>it will be an everlasting covenant.</b><br>The term "everlasting" emphasizes the perpetual nature of this covenant, contrasting with the temporary and conditional covenants of the past. This everlasting covenant is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice established a permanent relationship between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>). The idea of an everlasting covenant also connects to the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), highlighting continuity in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>I will establish them and multiply them,</b><br>This promise of establishment and multiplication recalls the blessings given to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 26</a>:4, 28:14). It signifies not only physical growth and prosperity but also spiritual flourishing. In the context of Ezekiel, it reassures the exiled Israelites of their future restoration and growth as a nation. This multiplication is both a literal promise of increased numbers and a metaphor for spiritual expansion and influence.<p><b>and I will set My sanctuary among them forever.</b><br>The sanctuary represents God's presence among His people, a central theme in the Old Testament. This promise points to the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, where God's presence will dwell with humanity eternally (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). In Ezekiel's context, it anticipates the rebuilding of the temple, symbolizing God's return to His people. Theologically, it foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, making them a living sanctuary (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of both judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, they are in exile in Babylon, longing for restoration and a return to their homeland.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, representing both physical and spiritual captivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_of_peace.htm">Covenant of Peace</a></b><br>A divine promise from God to His people, signifying restoration, blessing, and a future hope.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sanctuary.htm">God's Sanctuary</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's presence among His people, indicating a restored relationship and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_covenant_of_peace.htm">Understanding the Covenant of Peace</a></b><br>The "covenant of peace" is a divine promise that transcends temporary circumstances, offering eternal hope and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_everlasting_nature_of_god's_promises.htm">The Everlasting Nature of God's Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are not bound by time; they are everlasting, providing assurance and stability to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_god's_presence.htm">The Significance of God's Presence</a></b><br>God's sanctuary among His people signifies His desire for a close, personal relationship with them, offering guidance, protection, and blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_and_establishment.htm">Multiplication and Establishment</a></b><br>God's promise to "multiply" and "establish" His people speaks to His intention to bless them abundantly and secure their future.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_in_modern_life.htm">Application in Modern Life</a></b><br>Believers today can find comfort in God's unchanging promises, trusting in His presence and provision in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_37_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 37:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_26_God_s_eternal_covenant.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:26 illustrate God's promise of an "everlasting covenant"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_feel_God_s_peace_daily.htm">In what ways can we experience God's "peace" in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_26_and_Hebrews_8_10_link.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:26 connect to the New Covenant in Hebrews 8:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_God_s_sanctuary_within_us.htm">What steps can we take to ensure God's "sanctuary" is within us today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_God_s_dwelling_in_communities.htm">How can we apply the promise of God's "dwelling place" in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_26_and_Israel_s_covenant.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:26 relate to God's covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_peace_in_Ezekiel_37_26.htm">What is the significance of "peace" in Ezekiel 37:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ezekiel_37_26_to_Messiah_prophecy.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:26 connect to the prophecy of the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_ezekiel_37_25-28_fulfilled_today.htm">How can Ezekiel 37:25&#8211;28&#8217;s everlasting covenant and sanctuary be understood when there seems to be no clear historical or present-day fulfillment matching this depiction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_no_evidence_for_ezekiel_42_4_design.htm">Ezekiel 42:4 describes specific architectural details for temple chambers&#8212;why is there no clear archaeological evidence supporting this exact design?

Even John the Baptist had said, "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham"; but our Lord more emphatically taught that the true children of Abraham were those who followed Him (<a href="/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>, &c.); while His Apostle St. Paul explains repeatedly, and at length, that Abraham was the father of all those who walk in his faith, whether they be of the circumcision or the uncircumcision (<a href="/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>, &c.); and again, "that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>). Thus was fulfilled the promise that he should be "the father of many nations" (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a>, interpreted in <a href="/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>), and in the same way also was to be fulfilled the present promise of the multiplication of the seed of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - With the people thus gathered (ver. 21), united (ver. 22), purified (ver. 23), and established under the rule of Messiah (ver. 25), Jehovah makes a <span class="cmt_word">covenant of peace</span> (see on Ezekiel 34:25; and comp. <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>), further characterized as <span class="cmt_word">an everlasting covenant</span>; or, <span class="accented">covenant of eternity</span> (see on Ezekiel 16:60; and comp. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>); which guarantees the continuance between him and them of undying friendship, conjoined with the bestowment on his part and the enjoyment on theirs of the highest social and religious blessings.

That this promise was in part implemented by the erection of the second temple in the days of Zerubbabel may be conceded, and also that Ezekiel himself may have looked forward to a literal restoration of the sanctuary; but its highest realization must be sought for, first in the Incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), next in God's inhabitation of the Church through the Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>), and finally in his tabernacling with redeemed men in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3, 22</a>). The last blessing specified is the intimate communion of God with his people, and of them with him - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> This, which formed the kernel of the old covenant with Israel (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>), became the essence of the new covenant with the Israel of the restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>;
