The "loud voice" signifies the importance and seriousness of the command. In biblical context, God often speaks in a loud voice to convey judgment or significant revelation (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>). The prophet Ezekiel is receiving a vision, and his role as a watchman (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>) is underscored by his ability to hear and relay God's messages.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Draw near, O executioners of the city</b><br>The "executioners of the city" are likely angelic beings tasked with carrying out divine judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of God using agents, both human and supernatural, to execute His will (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). The city in question is Jerusalem, which is facing judgment due to its idolatry and rebellion against God (Ezekiel 8). The call to "draw near" indicates the imminence of this judgment.<p><b>each with a weapon of destruction in hand.&#8221;</b><br>The "weapon of destruction" symbolizes the impending judgment and the severity of the punishment to be inflicted. In the historical context, this reflects the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a fulfillment of prophetic warnings (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>). Theologically, it underscores the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin indefinitely. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical narrative of divine retribution and the ultimate judgment at the end of the age (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/executioners_of_the_city.htm">Executioners of the City</a></b><br>These are likely angelic beings or symbolic figures representing divine judgment, each carrying a weapon of destruction as instruments of God's wrath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, which is under divine judgment due to the people's idolatry and sinfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_voice.htm">God's Voice</a></b><br>The authoritative and commanding voice of God, indicating the seriousness and urgency of the impending judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/weapon_of_destruction.htm">Weapon of Destruction</a></b><br>Symbolizes the impending judgment and the severity of the consequences for the city's sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's judgment is a response to persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is just and sovereign, and His judgments are righteous.

The "loud voice" was to give emphasis to what is said; it is the natural expression of the fierceness of the Divine indignation and wrath.<p><span class= "bld">Them that have charge over the city.</span>--Not earthly officers, but those to whom God has especially entrusted the execution of His will concerning Jerusalem. The word is, no doubt, used often enough of human officers, but such sense is necessarily excluded here by the whole circumstances of the vision. Nor does the phrase "every man" at all indicate that they were human beings, the same expression being constantly used of angels (as in <a href="/context/genesis/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;">Genesis 18:1-2</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>; <a href="/judges/13-11.htm" title="And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman?

They appear only in the light of the administrators of vengeance, the description of them being that each had "his destroying weapon in his hand." This is repeated in the following verse. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cried,</span> etc. The voice comes, as before, from the human form, seen as a theophany, in the midst of the Divine glory. <span class="cmt_word">Cause them that have charge over the city.</span> The noun is an abstract plural, commonly rendered "visitation" (<a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>, and elsewhere). Here, however, it clearly stands for persons (just as we use "the watch" for "the watchmen"), and is so used in <a href="/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>). The persons addressed are called "men," but they are clearly thought of as superhuman; like the angels who came to Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>); like the angel with the drawn sword in <a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His destroying weapon.</span> The word clearly implies something different from a sword, but corresponds in its vagueness to the Hebrew. In ver. 2 the Hebrew for "slaughter weapon" implies an instrument for crashing into fragments, probably an axe or mace. A cognate word in <a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is translated "battle axe," and the LXX. gives that meaning here, as also does the margin of the Revised Version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I heard Him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;nay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
