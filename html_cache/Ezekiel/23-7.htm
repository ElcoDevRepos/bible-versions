The "elite of Assyria" refers to the political and military leaders of the Assyrian Empire, a dominant power in the ancient Near East. Historically, Israel and Judah often sought alliances with Assyria, compromising their faithfulness to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual adultery, where Israel's pursuit of foreign alliances and gods is likened to infidelity. The prophets frequently condemned such alliances, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a> and <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>, where reliance on foreign powers is portrayed as a lack of trust in God.<p><b>She defiled herself with all the idols of those for whom she lusted.</b><br>Idolatry is a central theme in the prophetic literature, symbolizing the spiritual corruption and apostasy of Israel. The term "defiled" indicates a state of ritual impurity, which in the Old Testament often results from idolatry and immorality. The idols of Assyria, such as those of Ashur and Ishtar, were part of a polytheistic system that Israel was forbidden to adopt (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This phrase underscores the spiritual consequences of Israel's alliances, as they not only sought political security but also adopted the religious practices of their neighbors, violating the covenant with Yahweh. This theme is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, where idolatry is equated with harlotry, emphasizing the betrayal of their exclusive relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively.

The prophet uses the stark image of prostitution to show how God sees political alliances that reject trust in Him.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s kings paid tribute and sought Assyrian protection instead of relying on the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19&#8211;20</a>; 17:3).<p>&#8226; Hosea captures the same pursuit: &#8220;For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey on its own&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a> draws a parallel with earlier liaisons: &#8220;You lusted after your neighbors, the Egyptians.&#8221;<p>By turning to Assyria&#8217;s &#8220;elite,&#8221; Israel wasn&#8217;t just securing treaties; she was selling her spiritual fidelity. God&#8217;s covenant people were meant to look to Him alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6&#8211;8</a>). The blunt wording reminds us how repulsive spiritual compromise is to a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She defiled herself with all the idols</b><p>The alliances came packaged with Assyria&#8217;s gods. Instead of remaining distinct, Israel imported foreign shrines, symbols, and rituals.<p>&#8226; &#8220;They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah warns against this same contamination: &#8220;You will defile your silver-covered idols&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-36.htm">Psalm 106:36</a> sums up the tragedy: &#8220;They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.&#8221;<p>Defilement here is more than ceremonial uncleanness; it is moral rot.

Samaria eagerly courted Assyria&#8217;s leaders, trading covenant loyalty for political security.

The verse warns that spiritual compromise is never harmless; it defiles and dims the witness of God&#8217;s people.
