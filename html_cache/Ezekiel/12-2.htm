It underscores the contrast between the divine message he delivers and his human nature. The term is also a messianic title used for Jesus Christ in the New Testament, highlighting His role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>you are living in a rebellious house</b><br>Ezekiel is among the exiles in Babylon, living with the Israelites who have been deported due to their disobedience to God. The term "rebellious house" refers to the persistent disobedience and idolatry of the Israelites, which led to their exile. This rebellion is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the covenantal relationship between God and Israel and their frequent breaches of that covenant.<p><b>They have eyes to see but do not see</b><br>This phrase indicates spiritual blindness. Despite having the ability to perceive God's works and messages, the Israelites choose not to understand or accept them. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and later in the New Testament in <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>, where Jesus speaks of the people's inability to perceive spiritual truths.<p><b>and ears to hear but do not hear</b><br>Similar to their spiritual blindness, the Israelites are described as having the capacity to hear God's word but refusing to listen. This selective hearing is a metaphor for their stubbornness and unwillingness to heed prophetic warnings. This theme is also present in <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a> and is reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/mark/8-18.htm">Mark 8:18</a>, emphasizing the importance of spiritual receptivity.<p><b>for they are a rebellious house</b><br>The repetition of "rebellious house" underscores the severity and persistence of Israel's disobedience. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God, which in this context, is the Babylonian exile. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual hope of restoration, as God remains faithful to His covenant, promising redemption and return for those who repent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
