In the Old Testament, this glory was seen in the cloud that led the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). It signifies God's holiness, power, and divine presence. In Ezekiel's vision, the return of God's glory to the temple symbolizes the restoration of His presence among His people, which had departed due to their sin (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>).<p><b>entered the temple</b><br>The temple is the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God among His people. Ezekiel's vision of the glory entering the temple signifies a future hope of restoration and renewal for Israel. Historically, the temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, and its desecration or destruction was seen as a profound loss. This vision points to a time when God will once again dwell among His people, fulfilling His covenant promises.<p><b>through the gate</b><br>The gate is a significant architectural feature in ancient cities and temples, serving as a point of entry and exit. In Ezekiel's vision, the specific mention of the gate highlights the orderly and purposeful return of God's presence. Gates in biblical times were also places of judgment and decision-making, symbolizing authority and governance.<p><b>facing east</b><br>The east holds symbolic importance in biblical literature. The Garden of Eden was planted in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the entrance to the tabernacle faced east (<a href="/exodus/27-13.htm">Exodus 27:13-16</a>). The east is often associated with the direction from which divine intervention or blessing comes. In Ezekiel's vision, the east-facing gate signifies the direction of God's return, aligning with the expectation of the Messiah's coming from the east (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>). This orientation also connects to the rising sun, symbolizing new beginnings and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
