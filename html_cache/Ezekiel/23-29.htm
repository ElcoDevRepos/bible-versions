The hatred from foreign nations, particularly the Babylonians, is a result of Israel's alliances and idolatry. Historically, these alliances were often political and involved adopting foreign religious practices, which led to God's judgment. This hatred can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience would lead to becoming an object of scorn.<p><b>take all for which you have worked</b><br>The loss of possessions and wealth signifies the stripping away of what Israel had gained through its alliances and efforts. This reflects the futility of relying on human strength and foreign powers instead of God. The historical context includes the Babylonian conquest, where Jerusalem was plundered, and its treasures taken (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of worldly wealth and the importance of spiritual fidelity.<p><b>and leave you naked and bare</b><br>Nakedness in the Bible often symbolizes shame and exposure of sin (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>). Here, it represents the complete humiliation and vulnerability of Israel due to its spiritual adultery. The imagery of being left naked underscores the totality of judgment and the removal of any pretense of dignity or protection, as seen in the Babylonian exile.<p><b>so that the shame of your prostitution will be exposed</b><br>This phrase highlights the public exposure of Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness, likened to prostitution. The prophetic language used by Ezekiel is intended to shock and bring awareness to the gravity of Israel's sin. The exposure serves as a divine judgment, revealing the consequences of forsaking God for other deities, as warned in <a href="/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>.<p><b>Your indecency and promiscuity</b><br>Indecency and promiscuity refer to Israel's spiritual infidelity and the worship of foreign gods. This behavior is condemned throughout the prophetic books, where idolatry is equated with adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>). The historical context includes the adoption of Canaanite religious practices, which were often sexually immoral. This phrase serves as a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness, emphasizing the need for purity and devotion to God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>Symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, representing the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel, respectively.
