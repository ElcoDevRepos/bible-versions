In the context of ancient Israel, offerings were made to God as a form of worship and gratitude. However, here it is used to describe Israel's idolatry, where they misused God's gifts for pagan worship. The "pleasing aroma" is reminiscent of the language used in Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>) to describe sacrifices that were acceptable to God, highlighting the irony and tragedy of Israel's actions.<p><b>the food I had given you</b><br>This refers to the blessings and provisions God had bestowed upon Israel. In the wilderness, God provided manna (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>) and later, in the Promised Land, He gave them abundance. The phrase underscores God's role as the provider and the ingratitude of Israel in using these gifts for idolatry. It echoes the covenant relationship where God promised to care for His people if they remained faithful.<p><b>the fine flour, oil, and honey</b><br>These items were symbols of prosperity and blessing in the ancient Near East. Fine flour was a staple for making bread, oil was used for cooking and anointing, and honey was a luxury item. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, these are listed among the bounties of the Promised Land. Their misuse in idol worship represents a profound betrayal of the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>that I had fed you</b><br>This emphasizes God's provision and care for Israel. It recalls the sustenance provided during the Exodus and the ongoing blessings in the land of Canaan. The phrase highlights the divine origin of these gifts, contrasting with their profane use in idolatry. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness despite Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>That is what happened, declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This statement serves as a divine confirmation of the events described. It underscores the authority and sovereignty of God in declaring judgment. The phrase "declares the Lord GOD" is a prophetic formula used throughout Ezekiel to affirm the truth and certainty of God's words. It serves as a solemn reminder of the consequences of Israel's actions and the seriousness of their covenant breach.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

By doing so, they twisted sacrificial language meant for the Lord into praise for false gods.
