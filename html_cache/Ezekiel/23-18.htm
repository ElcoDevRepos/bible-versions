The imagery of prostitution is used to describe the spiritual unfaithfulness of the people, as they turned to idolatry and alliances with pagan nations. This metaphor is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where idolatry is often equated with adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>, <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>). The term "openly" suggests a blatant and shameless departure from covenantal faithfulness, highlighting the severity of their sin.<p><b>and exposed her nakedness</b><br>Nakedness in biblical terms often symbolizes shame and vulnerability (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>). Here, it indicates the exposure of Jerusalem's sins and the loss of divine protection. The act of exposing nakedness is a metaphor for revealing the true nature of their idolatry and moral corruption, which was once hidden but now laid bare for all to see.<p><b>I turned away from her in disgust</b><br>God's turning away signifies His withdrawal of favor and protection due to their persistent unfaithfulness. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's patience is eventually exhausted by the people's rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, <a href="/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>). The disgust reflects God's holiness and intolerance of sin, emphasizing the seriousness of their spiritual adultery.<p><b>just as I had turned away from her sister</b><br>Oholibah's sister, Oholah, represents Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Samaria had already faced judgment and destruction due to similar sins (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-18</a>). This reference serves as a warning to Jerusalem, illustrating that God's judgment is impartial and that Judah is not exempt from the consequences of their actions. The parallel between the two sisters underscores the theme of repeated unfaithfulness and the inevitability of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah</a></b><br>Represents the southern kingdom of Judah.
