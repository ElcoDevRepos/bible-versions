The role of a watchman, as described earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/3.htm">Ezekiel 3</a>, is to provide warnings and guidance. This reflects the broader biblical principle of accountability within the community of believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>, where believers are encouraged to restore one another gently.<p><b>and he does not sin</b><br>The outcome of the warning is positive; the righteous person heeds the warning and refrains from sinning. This highlights the power of prophetic warning and the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also underscores the concept of free will, where the individual has the choice to respond to the warning. This aligns with the teachings in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which encourages believers to be doers of the word, not just hearers.<p><b>he will indeed live</b><br>The promise of life is both physical and spiritual. In the Old Testament context, obedience often resulted in tangible blessings and protection, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Spiritually, this points to eternal life, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where belief and obedience lead to everlasting life.<p><b>because he heeded your warning</b><br>The emphasis here is on the response to the warning. The righteous man's decision to heed the warning is crucial for his continued well-being. This reflects the biblical principle that God desires obedience over sacrifice, as stated in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>. It also shows the effectiveness of the prophet's role when the message is delivered faithfully.<p><b>and you will have saved yourself.</b><br>This phrase underscores the dual responsibility of the prophet: to deliver God's message and to ensure his own accountability. By fulfilling his duty, the prophet is not held responsible for the potential sin of the righteous man. This concept is echoed in the New Testament in <a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>, where Paul declares himself innocent of the blood of all men because he did not hesitate to proclaim the whole will of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

That role includes sounding an alarm whenever righteousness is threatened. The verse assumes the righteous are still capable of stumbling; love therefore calls for timely warning (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Warning is not meddling; it is obedience to God&#8217;s charge (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The message is clear and moral, not speculative&#8212;&#8220;not to sin.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Faithfulness requires speaking even when silence feels easier (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he does not sin</b><p>The hoped-for outcome follows: the righteous one takes the counsel to heart and turns from potential disobedience.
