The term "Son of man" is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently uses it to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and fulfillment of prophecy (e.g., <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<p><b>there were two women</b><br>The two women symbolize the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. This allegory is used to illustrate their unfaithfulness to God through idolatry and alliances with pagan nations. The use of women in prophetic literature often represents cities or nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a> and <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17:1-5</a>.<p><b>daughters of the same mother</b><br>This phrase indicates that both Israel and Judah originated from the same covenant relationship with God, established through the patriarchs and the giving of the Law at Sinai.

By beginning this oracle with the familiar address, the Lord signals continuity with earlier visions (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8&#8211;11</a>) and sets a sober tone for the shocking allegory that follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there were two women</b><p>Immediately God introduces an extended parable: two women who stand for the two kingdoms.<p>&#8226;
