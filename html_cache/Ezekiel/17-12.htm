This phrase highlights the spiritual state of the people, who had turned away from God despite numerous warnings from prophets. The rebellion is not just political but deeply spiritual, reflecting a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where Israel repeatedly strayed from their covenant with God.<p><b>&#8216;Do you not know what these things mean?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question implies that the people should understand the significance of the events unfolding around them. It suggests that the meaning of the parable or allegory should be clear to them, given their knowledge of the covenant and the consequences of disobedience. This echoes the prophetic tradition where God, through His prophets, often used parables and symbolic actions to convey His messages, expecting the people to discern their meaning.<p><b>Tell them, &#8216;Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem,</b><br>The king of Babylon refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, who was a dominant figure in the ancient Near East during this period. His campaigns against Jerusalem are well-documented both biblically and historically. This event marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as it led to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event that reshaped Jewish identity and religious practice.<p><b>carried off its king and officials,</b><br>This phrase refers to the deportation of King Jehoiachin and the leading officials of Judah to Babylon. This was a common practice in ancient conquests, aimed at weakening the subjugated nation by removing its leadership and potential sources of rebellion. The exile of the king and officials symbolizes the loss of national sovereignty and the beginning of a period of judgment and purification for the people of Judah.<p><b>and brought them back with him to Babylon.</b><br>Babylon, the center of the Babylonian Empire, was a city of great power and influence. The relocation of the Judean elite to Babylon not only served political purposes but also exposed them to Babylonian culture and religion. This period of exile is crucial in biblical history, as it led to significant developments in Jewish theology and practice, including a renewed focus on the law and the writings of the prophets. Theologically, the exile is seen as both a punishment for sin and a means of eventual restoration, as prophesied by Jeremiah and others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

The people have just heard Ezekiel&#8217;s parable of the two eagles and the vine (<a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3-10</a>) yet fail to grasp its obvious meaning&#8212;just as earlier audiences missed Jeremiah&#8217;s acted-out sermons (<a href="/jeremiah/16-1.htm">Jeremiah 16:1-13</a>).<p>- The question mirrors Jesus&#8217; later challenge to His disciples about understanding parables (<a href="/mark/4-13.htm">Mark 4:13</a>), underscoring that truth is available but must be received with a responsive heart (<a href="/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem</b><p>- The statement moves from parable to plain history: Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s arrival in 597 BC (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-11</a>).<p>- God is sovereignly directing political events, using a pagan ruler as His instrument of judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>).<p>- The verb &#8220;came&#8221; signals a decisive invasion that ended Judah&#8217;s illusion of security (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carried off its king and officials</b><p>- Nebuchadnezzar deported King Jehoiachin, the royal family, and the leading men of the land (<a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12-16</a>).<p>- This removal stripped Judah of leadership, fulfilling earlier warnings that disobedience would result in exile (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s discipline targeted those responsible for guiding the nation, just as He later held shepherds accountable in <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And brought them back with him to Babylon</b><p>- The captives were resettled in Babylon, where they would live under foreign rule for seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p>- Yet even in exile, God promised to preserve a remnant and give them &#8220;a heart to know Me&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>).<p>- Stories of Daniel, Ezekiel himself, and Esther show God&#8217;s sustaining grace among the deportees (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12</a> translates the vivid parable of the eagles into plain terms: Judah&#8217;s rebellion produced God&#8217;s judgment, executed through Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s conquest and deportation. The verse explains that the fall of Jehoiachin and the exile of Judah&#8217;s leaders were not random geopolitical events but deliberate acts of divine discipline. By restating the history, God calls His people to recognize His sovereignty, repent of their stubbornness, and trust that even in judgment He is working out His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - The parable has been spoken. Ezekiel, after the pause implied in ver. 11, now becomes its interpreter. And that interpretation is to be addressed to the "rebellious house" (<a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3, 6</a>) among whom he lived. Probably even among the exiles of Tel-Abib there were some who cherished hopes of the success of the Egyptian alliance, and of the downfall of the power of Babylon as its outcome. The tenses are better in the indefinite past - "came," "took," "brought," and so on in ver. 13. The history of Jeconiah's deportation and of Zedekiah's oath of fealty (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>) is recapitulated. He dwells specially on the fact that the <span class="cmt_word">mighty of the land</span> had been carried off with Jecoutah. It was Nebuchadnezzar's policy to deprive the kingdom of all its elements of strength - to leave it "bare." Even masons. smiths, and carpenters were carried off, lest they should be used for warlike preparations (<a href="/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>). It could not lift itself up. It was enough if "by keeping its covenant" it was allowed to stand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">say to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#257;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this rebellious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
