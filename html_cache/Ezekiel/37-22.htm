Historically, after the reign of Solomon, the kingdom split into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). This division led to separate political, religious, and cultural developments. The prophecy of reunification signifies a return to unity under God's sovereignty. This also foreshadows the ultimate unity of God's people, as seen in the New Testament, where believers are united in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>on the mountains of Israel</b><br>The mountains of Israel are significant both geographically and symbolically. Geographically, they refer to the central highlands of the land of Israel, a region of historical and strategic importance. Symbolically, mountains often represent stability and permanence in biblical literature. This setting underscores the enduring nature of God's promise to restore and unify His people in their ancestral land.<p><b>and one king will rule over all of them</b><br>This phrase points to the messianic expectation of a single, divinely appointed ruler. Historically, the divided kingdoms had separate kings, but the prophecy envisions a future where one king, often interpreted as the Messiah, will reign over a united Israel. This is seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King and Shepherd of His people (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>Then they will no longer be two nations</b><br>The division into two nations was a result of sin and disobedience, leading to political and spiritual fragmentation. The promise of no longer being two nations signifies healing and restoration. This reflects God's desire for unity among His people, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the unity of the Church (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>and will never again be divided into two kingdoms</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the permanence of the reunification. Historically, the division was a source of conflict and weakness. The prophecy assures that such division will not recur, highlighting the eternal nature of God's covenant with His people. This can be seen as a precursor to the eternal kingdom established by Christ, where division and strife are abolished (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and restoration to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which was previously divided from Judah, representing the people of God who are promised reunification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, which, along with Israel, will be united under one king as prophesied by Ezekiel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_israel.htm">Mountains of Israel</a></b><br>Symbolic of the promised land where the reunification and restoration of the nation will occur.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/one_king.htm">One King</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to a future leader, often interpreted as the Messiah, who will unite and rule over the restored nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>Just as God promised to unite Israel and Judah, believers today are called to unity in Christ, transcending divisions within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_fulfillment.htm">Messianic Fulfillment</a></b><br>The prophecy of one king points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate King who unites all believers under His lordship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>God's promise to restore and reunite His people offers hope for personal and communal restoration in our lives today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>The prophecy underscores God's control over history and His ability to fulfill His promises, encouraging trust in His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_reconciliation.htm">Call to Reconciliation</a></b><br>As God reconciles Israel and Judah, believers are called to pursue reconciliation in their relationships, reflecting God's heart for unity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_37_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 37:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_22_God_s_unity_plan.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:22 illustrate God's plan for unity among His people?

The prophet has just illustrated this promise with the joining of two sticks (<a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-17</a>); now the Lord states plainly that He will fuse the divided people into a single nation. Earlier prophecies echo the same certainty: &#8220;I will gather you from all the nations and bring you back to the land&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>). The promise is literal; Israel&#8217;s scattered tribes will be physically regathered and transformed from exile into nationhood, just as the dry bones were re-fleshed and revived (<a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the mountains of Israel</b><p>The reunion is not abstract but geographic. &#8220;I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them&#8230; to their own land; I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13-14</a>). These mountains, once defiled by idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3-6</a>), will become the stage for restored blessing (<a href="/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1-8</a>). By specifying the uplands, God underscores both security and visibility: a united Israel will dwell openly, unmistakably at home, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>&#8217;s picture of a banner to the nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and one king will rule over all of them</b><p>The reunion requires a single shepherd-king. Earlier the Lord promised, &#8220;I will place over them one Shepherd, My servant David&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>). That promise stretches forward to the Messiah, the eternal heir of David&#8217;s throne (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).

Centuries of rivalry, war, and divergent worship followed. God&#8217;s promise reverses that history. <a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a> foresaw Ephraim&#8217;s envy vanishing and Judah&#8217;s hostility ceasing. Here, Ezekiel reaffirms that the centuries-old breach will be healed. For modern readers, it reminds us that no division&#8212;political, ethnic, or spiritual&#8212;is beyond the Lord&#8217;s power to mend.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will never again be divided into two kingdoms</b><p>The restoration is permanent. &#8220;I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be uprooted&#8221; (<a href="/amos/9-15.htm">Amos 9:15</a>). The everlasting covenant of peace (<a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>) guarantees ongoing unity:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sanctuary will stand among them forever (37:27-28).<p>&#8226; His Spirit will ensure obedience (<a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-40</a>).<p>&#8226; The possibility of another civil schism is erased; the kingdom&#8217;s integrity rests on divine, not human, faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a> promises a future, literal, and lasting reunion of Israel&#8217;s tribes under one King in their own land. The same Lord who reassembles dry bones will reunify a divided people, plant them securely on the mountains of Israel, and place the Davidic Messiah over them forever. The verse assures God&#8217;s people that His plans cannot be thwarted and foreshadows the ultimate harmony found under Christ&#8217;s righteous reign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
