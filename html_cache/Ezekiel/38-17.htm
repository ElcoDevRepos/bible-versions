It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the following message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This underscores the importance and seriousness of the message.<p><b>Are you the one of whom I have spoken in former days</b><br>This suggests a continuity in God's revelation, indicating that the events described have been part of God's plan for a long time. It implies that the current situation is a fulfillment of earlier prophecies, highlighting God's omniscience and the reliability of His word. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of prophecy and fulfillment.<p><b>through My servants, the prophets of Israel,</b><br>The prophets of Israel were God's chosen messengers, tasked with delivering His messages to the people. This phrase underscores the role of the prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. It also points to the collective witness of the prophets, suggesting that the message about this adversary was not isolated but part of a larger prophetic tradition.<p><b>who in those times prophesied for years</b><br>This indicates that the prophecies concerning this adversary were not sudden or recent but had been given over an extended period. It suggests a persistent and consistent warning from God through His prophets, emphasizing the patience and long-term planning of God. This can be seen as a call to heed prophetic warnings and recognize their significance.<p><b>that I would bring you against them?</b><br>This phrase highlights God's active role in orchestrating events, even those involving adversaries. It suggests that the coming of this adversary is not outside of God's control but is part of His divine plan. This can be connected to the theme of God's sovereignty over nations and history, as seen in other scriptures where God uses nations to accomplish His purposes, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign ruler and divine authority who speaks through the prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or entity that is prophesied to come against Israel.

The sovereign LORD&#8212;who spoke of this very foe long ago through a chorus of faithful prophets&#8212;now confronts Gog with the fact that every step he takes was foreseen and folded into God&#8217;s plan. The verse reassures Israel (and today&#8217;s reader) that history unfolds under divine supervision: the same God who foretold the conflict will also secure the victory and display His glory to the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Of whom I have spoken in old time.--</span>This is put in that interrogative form which is often used for emphatic assurance. The word <span class= "ital">many</span> before "years" is not in the original, but is correctly inserted to mark the accusative of duration. The statement is then an emphatic one, that God had of old and for a long time foretold by His prophets this attack of Gog. But the name of Gog is not mentioned in any earlier prophecy now extant, nor is it likely that any such, far less that any long series of such prophecies, have been lost. This concurs with many other indications in the prophecy to show that it does not relate to any particular event, but that Gog and his allies represent the enemies of the Church in general, and that the prophet is here depicting the same great and prolonged struggle between evil and good, between the powers of the world and the kingdom of God, which has formed the burden of so much of both earlier and later prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time</span>? As no existing prophecy, prior to Ezekiel's time, mentions Cog by name, it must be concluded either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ezekiel refers to prophecies known in his day, though no longer extant; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his words simply mean that earlier prophets had predicted such an invasion of Israel in the last times as that which he announces under the leadership of Gog. The former opinion, though countenanced by Ewald, Kuenen, and Smend, is less probable than the latter, which expositors both ancient and modern favor. Schroder considers the hypothesis that earlier prophets had spoken of Gog by name as excluded by the interrogatory form of the sentence, since, had Cog been thus explicitly pointed out, there would, he thinks, have been no need to ask, "Art thou he?" But it is doubtful if the interrogatory form of the words had any other intention than to lend emphasis to the assertion that Gog was he to whom the earlier prophets had unconsciously referred. As to which earlier prophets he alluded opinions vary. Ewald cites <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; Smend adding <a href="/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; Keil, <a href="/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5, 10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23</a>, 25; Joel 4:2, 11, etc.; Hengstenberg, <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24-27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; and Fairbairn, <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-28.htm">Isaiah 14:28-32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>; <a href="/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44, 45</a>; though Schroder is probably correct in holding that all should be included which represent the hostility of the heathen world as culminating in the latter days in a grand concentrated attack upon Israel. Smend sees in the unusual phenomenon that Ezekiel reflects upon earlier prophecies an indication of the declining spirit of prophetism; it should, however, rather be regarded as a sign of superior spiritual insight on the part of Ezekiel, who could discern that from the first the prophets had been guided in their utterances by One who was intimately acquainted with the whole world-program, and knew the end from the beginning, so that however dark and enigmatical their predictions might be when taken separately, when viewed in connection they were recognized as forming parts of a harmonious whole. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Are you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
