It underscores the divine authority given to Ezekiel to deliver God's message. The term "son of man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His role as the ultimate prophet and mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says</b><br>This phrase establishes the divine origin of the message. It is not Ezekiel's own words but a direct communication from God. This underscores the authority and seriousness of the prophecy. The use of "Lord GOD" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, a common theme in Ezekiel's prophecies.<p><b>concerning the Ammonites and their contempt:</b><br>The Ammonites were a neighboring nation of Israel, often in conflict with them. Their contempt refers to their hostility and mockery towards Israel, especially during times of Israel's distress. Historically, the Ammonites were descendants of Lot and had a long-standing enmity with Israel. This prophecy indicates that God is aware of their actions and will hold them accountable.<p><b>&#8216;A sword! A sword is drawn for slaughter,</b><br>The sword symbolizes impending judgment and destruction. In biblical imagery, the sword often represents divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>). The repetition emphasizes the certainty and severity of the coming judgment. Historically, this could refer to the Babylonian army, which God used as an instrument of judgment against various nations, including the Ammonites.<p><b>polished to consume,</b><br>The polishing of the sword suggests readiness and inevitability. It is prepared to fulfill its purpose of judgment. This imagery conveys the thoroughness and decisiveness of God's judgment. The idea of consumption indicates total destruction, leaving nothing behind.<p><b>to flash like lightning&#8212;</b><br>The comparison to lightning suggests the suddenness and swiftness of the judgment. Lightning is often associated with divine presence and power in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). This imagery reinforces the idea that God's judgment will be both powerful and unavoidable. The use of such vivid imagery serves to instill a sense of urgency and seriousness in the audience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites and surrounding nations during the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation of Israel, often in conflict with Israel, known for their contempt and hostility towards God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God who pronounces judgment on nations, including the Ammonites, for their actions and attitudes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's impending judgment and the instrument of His wrath against the Ammonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy.htm">Prophecy</a></b><br>The act of delivering God's message, often concerning future events, as Ezekiel does here regarding the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their destinies.

This would leave the inference that the Ammonites might escape altogether; and from the destruction of God's peculiar people, along with the immunity of their ancient enemies, the heathen would be likely to draw conclusions inconsistent with the power and majesty of God. Hence this prophecy is added to show that His judgments shall certainly fall on them also, and in this case the ruin foretold is final and hopeless, without the promise given to Israel in <a href="/ezekiel/21-27.htm" title="I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.">Ezekiel 21:27</a>. Another prophecy against Ammon is given in <a href="/context/ezekiel/25-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,">Ezekiel 25:1-7</a>. As a matter of history, the Ammonites were conquered, and their country desolated, by Nebuchadnezzar a few years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and they gradually dwindled away until their name and place among the nations finally disappeared.<p><span class= "bld">Their reproach</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, their exultation in the desolation of Israel. (See <a href="/ezekiel/25-3.htm" title="And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;">Ezekiel 25:3</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm" title="I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.">Zephaniah 2:8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites.</span> Ezekiel has not forgotten that scene at the parting of the ways. The Ammonites, when they saw the issue of the divination, and the march of the Chaldean army to the west, thought themselves safe. They took up their reproach against Jerusalem, and exulted in its fall. They are warned, as in another strophe of the "Lay of the Sword of Jehovah," that their confidence is vain (comp. <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> for a like exultation at an earlier period). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
