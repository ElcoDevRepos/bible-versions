The Nile was considered a source of life and sustenance, and its deification in Egyptian religion made it a target for divine judgment. This judgment reflects God's sovereignty over all nations and their gods, as seen in <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, where God executed judgment on the gods of Egypt during the plagues. The phrase underscores the theme of divine retribution against pride and idolatry.<p><b>I will turn the land of Egypt into a ruin, a desolate wasteland</b><br>This prophecy foretells the devastation of Egypt, a nation known for its wealth and power. Historically, Egypt was a dominant force in the ancient Near East, often seen as a place of refuge and strength. The imagery of a "desolate wasteland" contrasts sharply with Egypt's fertile lands, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment. This desolation serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of opposing God's will, similar to the fate of Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>.<p><b>from Migdol to Syene,</b><br>Migdol and Syene represent the northern and southern extremities of Egypt, respectively. Migdol, located near the northeastern border, was a fortified city, while Syene (modern Aswan) was near the southern border. This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting the entire land. The mention of these locations highlights the historical and geographical accuracy of the prophecy, as both were significant in Egypt's defense and trade routes.<p><b>and as far as the border of Cush.</b><br>Cush refers to the region south of Egypt, known today as Sudan. The inclusion of Cush signifies the extent of Egypt's influence and the reach of the impending judgment. Historically, Egypt and Cush had complex relations, including periods of conflict and cooperation. The border of Cush marks the southern limit of Egypt's power, and the prophecy suggests that even Egypt's influence over Cush would be affected. This reflects the broader theme of God's control over all nations, as seen in <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>, where God reminds Israel of His sovereignty over Cushites and other peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The Migdol (equivalent to "tower") so named is mentioned in the 'Itinerarium' of Antoninus (p. 171, edit.

The expedition of Psammis against Ethiopia, as above, had probably given prominence to the latter fortress.
