These visions were a primary means by which God communicated His messages to Ezekiel, providing insight into spiritual realities and future events. Visions in the Bible often signify a deeper spiritual truth or a forthcoming divine action.<p><b>was like the vision I had seen when He came to destroy the city</b><br>This refers to the earlier vision Ezekiel had in chapters 8-11, where he witnessed the glory of the Lord departing from the temple in Jerusalem, symbolizing impending judgment and destruction due to the people's idolatry and sin. The destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC by the Babylonians fulfilled this vision, emphasizing God's holiness and justice.<p><b>and like the visions I had seen by the River Kebar</b><br>The River Kebar was in Babylon, where Ezekiel was among the exiles. The initial vision by the Kebar (Ezekiel 1) introduced the glory of God in a dramatic and awe-inspiring manner, with the appearance of the living creatures and the wheels. This setting underscores the theme of God's presence with His people, even in exile, and His sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>I fell facedown</b><br>Ezekiel's response of falling facedown is a common biblical reaction to divine encounters, signifying reverence, awe, and submission to God's overwhelming presence. This posture reflects the appropriate human response to the holiness and majesty of God, seen in other biblical figures such as Daniel and John in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of divine visions and messages, tasked with conveying God's words to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>This refers to the divine revelation Ezekiel receives, which is consistent with previous visions, particularly those concerning God's glory and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_river_kebar.htm">The River Kebar</a></b><br>A location in Babylon where Ezekiel received earlier visions, symbolizing a place of divine encounter and revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, which faced destruction as a consequence of the Israelites' disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_glory.htm">God's Glory</a></b><br>The manifestation of God's presence, often depicted as a radiant and overwhelming force, central to Ezekiel's visions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consistency_of_god's_revelation.htm">The Consistency of God's Revelation</a></b><br>God's messages and visions are consistent and reliable.

The verse we are studying explains why this moment carries such weight for the prophet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the vision I saw was like the vision I had seen</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel immediately recognizes what he is seeing; it is the same divine glory he has encountered before.<p>&#8226; The repetition underscores that God is consistent in His self-revelation: His holiness, majesty, and splendor do not change (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the earlier visions proved trustworthy, Ezekiel can trust that this new revelation about a restored temple and renewed worship will also be fulfilled literally (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when He came to destroy the city</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel recalls the vision in chapters 8&#8211;11, where God&#8217;s glory departed Jerusalem as judgment approached, culminating in the Babylonian destruction foretold in 586 BC (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>; 11:22-23).<p>&#8226; That memory highlights both God&#8217;s justice and His mercy.

The prophet recognizes the same unchanging, holy glory he saw at Kebar and during Jerusalem&#8217;s judgment. God&#8217;s return to the temple guarantees that the exile&#8217;s sorrow will give way to restoration.

Ewald and Smend follow the Vulgate. <span class="accented">quando venit ut disperderet</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> substituting "he," Jehovah, for "I," Ezekiel; but the change is unnecessary, as the prophet's language is perfectly intelligible and quite correct, since "the prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy" (Hitzig), and it is not unusual for Scripture to represent a prophet as himself doing what he is only sent to predict (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The prophet's reason for introducing this clause was manifestly the same he had for identifying the visions - to show that, while it was the same Jehovah who had departed from the old temple that was now returning to the new, there was nothing incongruous in the idea that he who in the past had shown himself a God of justice and judgment by overturning and destroying the old, should in the future exhibit himself as a God of grace and mercy by condescending to establish his abode in the new. The impression produced upon the prophet's soul by his vision was the same that had been produced by the <span class="accented">former - he fell upon his face</span> in awe and wonder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;mar&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k &#124;
