It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, as it originates from God Himself. This divine command is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God speaks to His chosen messengers.<p><b>Prophesy to the breath</b><br>The term "breath" here is significant, as it is translated from the Hebrew word "ruach," which can mean breath, spirit, or wind. This command to prophesy to the breath highlights the spiritual nature of the vision. The breath symbolizes the life-giving Spirit of God, reminiscent of the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam.<p><b>Prophesy, son of man</b><br>"Son of man" is a title used frequently for Ezekiel, emphasizing his humanity and role as a representative of the people. It also foreshadows the use of this title for Jesus in the New Testament, where it signifies His role as the Messiah and His identification with humanity.<p><b>And tell the breath that this is what the Lord GOD says</b><br>This phrase establishes the authority of the message, as it comes directly from the Lord GOD. It reinforces the idea that the power to give life resides with God alone. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes both the sovereignty and covenantal relationship of God with His people.<p><b>Come from the four winds, O breath</b><br>The "four winds" symbolize the universality and omnipresence of God's Spirit. This imagery suggests that God's life-giving power is not limited by geography or circumstance. It also connects to other biblical passages, such as <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>, where the four winds represent God's control over the earth.<p><b>And breathe into these slain</b><br>The "slain" refers to the dry bones seen earlier in the chapter, symbolizing the house of Israel in exile, spiritually dead and without hope. The act of breathing into them signifies resurrection and restoration, pointing to God's promise to revive and restore His people. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament with the resurrection of Jesus, who brings life to those who are spiritually dead.<p><b>So that they may live!</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the prophecy is life. This reflects God's desire for His people to experience spiritual renewal and restoration. It foreshadows the new life offered through Jesus Christ, who declares Himself the resurrection and the life in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>. This promise of life is central to the Christian message of salvation and eternal life through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_dry_bones.htm">The Valley of Dry Bones</a></b><br>A vision given to Ezekiel, symbolizing the spiritual and national restoration of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breath.htm">The Breath (Ruach)</a></b><br>Represents the Spirit of God, which brings life and renewal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_winds.htm">The Four Winds</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's sovereign power and presence throughout the earth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slain.htm">The Slain</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, who are spiritually dead and in need of revival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_spirit.htm">The Power of God's Spirit</a></b><br>Just as the breath (Ruach) brought life to the dry bones, the Holy Spirit brings spiritual life and renewal to believers today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The four winds signify God's omnipresence and His ability to bring about His purposes from all corners of the earth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revival_and_restoration.htm">Revival and Restoration</a></b><br>The vision of the dry bones is a powerful reminder that no situation is too hopeless for God to restore and revive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_responsibility.htm">Prophetic Responsibility</a></b><br>Ezekiel's role in prophesying to the breath highlights the importance of obedience and faithfulness in delivering God's message.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_the_future.htm">Hope for the Future</a></b><br>This passage assures believers of God's promise to restore and give life, encouraging us to trust in His plans for renewal.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_37_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 37:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_9_God_s_power_over_death.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:9 illustrate God's power to bring life from death?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_breath_restore_dry_bones.htm">What role does the "breath" play in the restoration of the dry bones?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Invite_Holy_Spirit_to_enliven_our_lives.htm">How can we invite the Holy Spirit to "breathe" life into our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_God_s_breath_Ezekiel_37_9_Gen_2_7.htm">Connect Ezekiel 37:9 with Genesis 2:7 regarding God's life-giving breath.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Ezekiel_37_9_daily_in_faith.htm">How can we apply the message of Ezekiel 37:9 in our daily faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_9_God_s_power_to_restore_life.htm">What does Ezekiel 37:9 reveal about God's power to restore life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_9_and_spiritual_revival.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:9 relate to the concept of spiritual revival?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Ezekiel_37_9.htm">What historical context surrounds the prophecy in Ezekiel 37:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_four_winds_in_the_bible.htm">What are the Four Winds in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/main_themes_in_ezekiel.htm">What are the main themes in the Book of Ezekiel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_eccles._8_8_conflict_with_meteorology.htm">In Ecclesiastes 8:8, does the statement that no one can control the wind conflict with modern meteorological science and technology? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_breathe_for_holy_spirit.htm">Did Jesus breathe on them to receive the Holy Spirit?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 37:9 Mean</div><b>Then He said to me</b><p>God Himself initiates the action.

"Four winds" are mentioned, as in <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a>, to indicate the four quarters of heaven (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10, 12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>), and perhaps also to suggest the immense quantity of vitalizing force demanded by the multitude of the dead (Smend), "the fullness and force of the Spirit's operations" (Hengstenberg), or the notion that the Spirit, in resuscitating Israel, would make use of all the varied forces that were then working in the world (Plumptre). The designation of the dead as slain reveals that the resurrection intended was not that of men in general, but of the nation of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
