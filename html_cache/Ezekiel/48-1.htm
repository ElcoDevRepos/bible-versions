It reflects the restoration and reorganization of Israel, emphasizing God's faithfulness to His covenant with the patriarchs. The listing of tribes is reminiscent of earlier biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> and <a href="/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, where the tribes are also enumerated.<p><b>At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion:</b><br>Dan is the first tribe mentioned, located at the northern boundary of the land. Historically, Dan was one of the northernmost tribes, as seen in <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>. This positioning signifies a return to their ancestral inheritance, despite their previous struggles with idolatry and relocation.<p><b>Bordering the road of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath:</b><br>Hethlon and Lebo-hamath are geographical markers that define the northern boundary of the land. Lebo-hamath is often associated with the entrance to Hamath, a significant city-state in ancient Syria. This boundary aligns with the description of the Promised Land in <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>, indicating a restoration to the full extent of the land promised to Israel.<p><b>And running on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus with Hamath to the north:</b><br>Hazar-enan marks the northeastern boundary, near Damascus, a major city in ancient Aram. The mention of Damascus and Hamath highlights the extent of Israel's territory in the eschatological vision, suggesting a future where Israel's borders are secure and expansive, as prophesied in <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a>.<p><b>And extending from the east side to the west side:</b><br>This phrase indicates the breadth of the land allocation, stretching from east to west.

Earlier, the prophet heard, &#8220;This is the boundary by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>). Just as <a href="/bsb/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a> and <a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;19</a> recorded allocations in Joshua&#8217;s day, this passage speaks of a future allotment that fully restores Israel to the land under Messiah&#8217;s rule (<a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a>). The names highlight individual identity yet shared covenant inclusion&#8212;every tribe accounted for, none forgotten (<a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the northern frontier,</b><p>The list starts at the top of the land because, geographically, that is where Israel&#8217;s borders were first defined (<a href="/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7-9</a>). God fixes exact frontiers, underscoring His sovereignty over geography and history (<a href="/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>). This northern focus also reminds readers that past enemies came mainly from the north (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>), but in the coming age the same region will mark secure inheritance, not invasion (<a href="/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dan will have one portion</b><p>Dan, once displaced to Laish in <a href="/bsb/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, is restored here with a full share. Though Dan&#8217;s earlier idolatry caused spiritual decline (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>), God&#8217;s grace gives the tribe a place. The single &#8220;portion&#8221; matches every other tribe&#8217;s allotment (<a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a>), proving divine impartiality (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). Dan&#8217;s position at the border also provides a buffer for the nation, turning former weakness into service (cf. <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bordering the road of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath</b><p>Hethlon and Lebo-hamath mark the ancient northern entryway into Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). By naming real roads and towns, Scripture anchors the prophecy in literal geography, not symbolism alone. The same border appeared when Solomon&#8217;s kingdom reached its widest extent (<a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), anticipating an even fuller realization under Christ&#8217;s reign (<a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and running on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus with Hamath to the north,</b><p>Hazar-enan (also in <a href="/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>) forms the northeastern corner where Israel touches Damascus and Hamath. God delineates peaceful boundaries even alongside historically hostile neighbors (<a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>).

This uniform east-west alignment guarantees equal access to the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan Valley, reflecting God&#8217;s fair distribution (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>). It also ensures that every tribe faces the sanctuary&#8217;s central strip (<a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-12</a>), keeping worship at the heart of national life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a> marks the opening line of Israel&#8217;s future land assignment. God begins at the northern frontier, restores Dan with an equal share, specifies historic border points, and lays out an east-west allocation pattern. The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to covenant promises, His meticulous attention to geographic detail, and His gracious restoration of tribes once marred by failure. What was lost through sin will be reclaimed in the Messiah&#8217;s kingdom, where every boundary, tribe, and person fits perfectly into God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XLVIII.</span><p>The closing chapter of Ezekiel is mainly occupied with the distribution of the land in detail. Beginning at the north, a portion is assigned to each of seven tribes (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goes to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a>); then the "oblation" is described, with its parts for the Levites, the priests and Temple, the city and those that serve it, and for the prince (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>), and lastly portions for the remaining five tribes. The chapter and the book close with an account of the size and the twelve gates of the city, the whole ending with its name, "The Lord is there."<p>The distribution of the land is entirely different from that made under Joshua, nor is it easy to trace any historical reasons for it, except that the central portion, containing the Temple, the land of the priests and the prince, is flanked by the two tribes of the southern kingdom, Judah and Benjamin. The chapter can best be understood by the aid of a small map, the outline of which is traced from Dr. Wm. Smith's ancient atlas. This might be drawn with the lines between the tribes perpendicular either to the general course of the Jordan, or to the general coast-line of the Mediterranean. The latter would give a little more width for the oblation, but still not enough, and would leave no space at all on the west for the prince. The former arrangement is on the whole preferred. It will be seen that the tribes are not arranged either according to their seniority or their maternity. The territory falling to each tribe was much smaller than of old, partly because of the large space occupied by the "oblation" (fully one-fifth of the whole), and partly because the remainder was to be divided among the whole twelve tribes, instead of among only nine and a half. The portion thus given to each tribe was rather less than two-thirds that assigned, on the average, by Joshua.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">These are his sides east and west.</span>--<span class= "ital">Lit., The east side, the west side, shall be to him,</span> meaning that the portion of Dan stretches across the country from the eastern to the western boundary. So of them all. The original portion of Dan was at the west of Benjamin, but a part of the tribe having conquered Laish, and settled at the extreme north, Dan is now made the most northern of the tribes. Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim are so far approximated to their old places as to be north of the sanctuary.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">In length as one of the other parts.--</span>The oblation, which has been already spoken of in <a href="/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a> in a different connection, is here (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>) more exactly described. Its whole width is again stated as 25,000 reeds, and its length from the eastern to the western boundaries of the laud "as one of the other parts," no account being taken in this of the varying distance between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. It cannot, however, be so placed as not to exceed that distance. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-29.</span> - The <span class="accented">distribution of the land among the several tribes</span>.
