In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/20.htm">Ezekiel 20</a>, God recounts Israel's history of rebellion despite His guidance and blessings. The "statutes that were not good" can be understood as God allowing the Israelites to follow their own sinful desires and the pagan practices of surrounding nations, which were contrary to His righteous laws. This is reminiscent of <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>, where God "gave them over" to their sinful desires as a form of judgment. Theologically, this demonstrates God's respect for human free will and the consequences of choosing paths contrary to His will.<p><b>and ordinances by which they could not live</b><br>The ordinances mentioned here refer to the practices and decrees that led to spiritual and physical death rather than life. In <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, God sets before Israel life and death, urging them to choose life by obeying His commandments. The ordinances "by which they could not live" highlight the futility and destructiveness of living outside God's covenant. Historically, Israel's adoption of pagan customs, such as child sacrifice and idol worship, led to their downfall and exile. This serves as a warning of the spiritual death that results from turning away from God's life-giving laws. Theologically, it underscores the necessity of adherence to God's Word for true life, pointing to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the law and the source of eternal life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who were in rebellion against God and were being addressed by Ezekiel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a significant backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is speaking through Ezekiel, expressing His judgment and intentions for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/statutes_and_ordinances.htm">Statutes and Ordinances</a></b><br>Refers to the laws and decrees that God allowed the Israelites to follow, which were not beneficial due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's allowance of harmful statutes is a form of judgment, reflecting His respect for human free will and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>When we choose to ignore God's guidance, we may find ourselves following paths that lead to spiritual and moral decay.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>True life and fulfillment come from adhering to God's good and righteous laws, which are designed for our well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>Even in judgment, God's ultimate desire is for repentance and restoration, showing His mercy and love for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Reflect on areas in our lives where we might be following "statutes that are not good" and seek God's guidance to realign with His will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_20_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 20:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_25_Israel_s_disobedience.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:25 illustrate consequences of Israel's disobedience to God's laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_do_bad_statutes_show_about_God.htm">What does "statutes that were not good" reveal about God's judgment in Ezekiel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_God_s_will_to_avoid_laws.htm">How can we discern God's will to avoid "ordinances by which they could not live"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_25_vs_Romans_1_24-28_Choices.htm">Compare Ezekiel 20:25 with Romans 1:24-28 regarding God allowing human choices.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Align_Ezekiel_20_25_with_God_s_laws.htm">How can we apply Ezekiel 20:25 to ensure alignment with God's righteous statutes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_give_not_good_statutes_God.htm">Why would God give "statutes that were not good" in Ezekiel 20:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_25_God_s_justice_love.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:25 align with God's nature as just and loving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_couldn_t_they_live_by_Ezekiel_20_25_laws.htm">What historical context explains the "laws by which they could not live" in Ezekiel 20:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_'not_good'_laws_in_ezekiel_20_25.htm">What are the "not good" statutes in Ezekiel 20:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_ezekiel_20_25_align_with_god's_justice.htm">Ezekiel 20:25 mentions God giving Israel &#8220;statutes that were not good&#8221;; how does this align with the concept of a just and unchanging God elsewhere in Scripture?

He removes His protective restraints, hands them over to corrupt customs, and allows destructive rules to dominate them&#8212;rules that can never give life. The verse underlines two timeless truths: God&#8217;s law is always for our good, and rejecting it inevitably leads to bondage and death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Statutes that were not good.</span>--In this verse the general statement is made of which a particular instance is given in the next. The "statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live," cannot be the same with those described in <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm" title="And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.">Ezekiel 20:11</a> as "judgments which, if a man do, he shall even live in them." They are not, therefore, to be understood (as many of the fathers took them) of any part of the Mosaic law. Neither is it a sufficient explanation to say that God gave them what was intrinsically good, but it became evil to them through their sins; such a view of the law is emphatically discarded in <a href="/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.">Romans 7:13</a>. The statutes of the Mosaic law are not intended here at all, as is plain from the particular instance of the consecration of children to Moloch in the next verse. These evil statutes and judgments were those adopted from the heathen whom they had suffered to dwell among them, and from the surrounding nations. But how can the Lord say that <span class= "ital">He </span>gave these to them? In the same way that it is said in <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>, "O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from Thy ways, and hardened our heart from Thy fear?" So also St. Paul says of the heathen (<a href="/context/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21-28</a>) that God "gave them up to uncleanness," "unto vile affections," "to a reprobate mind;" and of certain wicked persons (<a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>) "God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believe not the truth." And St. Stephen says of these very Israelites at this very time, "God gave them up to worship the host of heaven" (<a href="/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>). It is part of that universal moral government of the world, to which Ezekiel so frequently refers, that the effect of disobedience and neglect of grace is to lead the sinner on to greater sin. The Israelites rebelled against the Divine government, and neglected the grace given them; the natural consequence was that they fell under the influence of the heathen. Comp. Note on <a href="/ezekiel/14-9.htm" title="And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the middle of my people Israel.">Ezekiel 14:9</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them</span> <span class="cmt_word">also statutes that were</span> <span class="cmt_word">not good,</span> etc. The words have sometimes been understood as though Ezekiel applied these terms to the Law itself, either as speaking of what St. Paul calls its "weak and beggarly elements" (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>), or as unable to work out the righteousness which it commanded (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>), and the language of <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a> and Hebrews 10:1 has been urged in support of this view. One who has studied Ezekiel with any care will not need many words to show that such a conclusion was not in his thoughts at all. For him the Law was "holy and just and good," and its statutes such that a man who should keep them should even live in them (vers. 13, 21). He is speaking of the time that followed on the second publication of that Law, and what he Says is that the people who rebelled against it were left, as it were, to a law of another kind. The baser, darker forms of idolatry are described by him, with a grave irony, as <span class="cmt_word">statutes</span> and <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> of another kind, working, not life, but death. Sin became, by God's appointment, the punishment of sin, that it might be manifest as exceeding sinful. So Stephen says of Israel that "God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven" (<a href="/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>). So St. Paul paints the corruptions of the heathen world as the result of God's giving them up to "vile affections" (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24, 25</a>). So in God's future dealings with an apostate form of Christianity, the same apostle declares that "God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts as asserting the same general law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
