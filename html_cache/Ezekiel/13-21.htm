These veils symbolize the lies and false assurances they provided, leading people away from God's truth. The act of tearing off the veils signifies God's intervention to expose and dismantle these deceptions. This imagery is consistent with God's actions throughout scripture, where He reveals truth and exposes falsehood, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, where God promises to destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples.<p><b>and deliver My people from your hands</b><br>This phrase highlights God's protective nature and His commitment to rescuing His people from spiritual bondage and deception. Historically, Israel often fell prey to false prophets and idolatry, leading to spiritual and physical captivity. God's deliverance is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>), where God delivers the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This deliverance is also a type of the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death.<p><b>so that they will no longer be prey in your hands</b><br>The imagery of being "prey" suggests vulnerability and exploitation. False prophets preyed on the fears and hopes of the people, leading them astray for personal gain. This phrase underscores God's desire to protect His people from such exploitation. In a broader biblical context, this reflects God's shepherd-like care, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where He leads and protects His flock. It also foreshadows the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This concluding phrase is a common declaration in Ezekiel, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the ultimate recognition of His authority. It serves as both a warning and a promise: a warning to those who oppose Him and a promise of vindication for His people. This acknowledgment of God's lordship is a central theme throughout the Bible, culminating in the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as Lord (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). It underscores the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's message, pointing to a future where God's sovereignty is universally recognized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Israel who claimed to speak for God but led the people astray with lies and deceit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/veils.htm">Veils</a></b><br>Symbolic of the deceptive practices used by false prophets to ensnare and manipulate the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals His power and authority through judgment and deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were often led astray by false teachings but are promised deliverance by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_leadership.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Leadership</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant and discerning about who they follow and listen to, ensuring that teachings align with Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is sovereign and will ultimately expose deceit and deliver His people from falsehood, affirming His justice and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deception.htm">The Danger of Deception</a></b><br>False teachings can lead believers astray, making it crucial to remain grounded in the truth of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_deliverance.htm">The Assurance of Deliverance</a></b><br>God's promise to deliver His people from deception is a source of hope and assurance for believers facing spiritual challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/k/knowing_god_through_his_actions.htm">Knowing God Through His Actions</a></b><br>God's interventions in history, such as delivering His people from false prophets, reveal His character and deepen our understanding of Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_13_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 13:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_13_21_s_warning_for_today_s_church.htm">How does Ezekiel 13:21 warn against false prophets in today's church?
