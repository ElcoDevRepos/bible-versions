The mention of Arvad highlights the international connections and alliances that Tyre, the subject of <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, maintained. Helech is less well-known, but it is often associated with regions known for their military prowess. The presence of these men on Tyre's walls signifies the city's reliance on foreign mercenaries for defense, a common practice in ancient times. This reflects Tyre's wealth and influence, as it could afford to hire skilled soldiers from distant lands.<p><b>and the men of Gammad were in your towers</b><br>The identity of Gammad is uncertain, but it is thought to refer to a group of people or a region known for their strength and military capabilities. The placement of these men in the towers suggests a strategic defense position, indicating their role in protecting the city from attacks. This detail emphasizes Tyre's comprehensive defense system and the importance of its fortifications. The use of foreign troops in key defensive positions also underscores the city's dependence on external support for its security.<p><b>They hung their shields around your walls</b><br>Hanging shields on the walls was both a practical and symbolic act. Practically, it provided ready access to weapons in case of an attack. Symbolically, it demonstrated the city's preparedness and strength, serving as a deterrent to potential aggressors. This practice is reminiscent of other ancient cultures that displayed military might through visible armaments. The imagery of shields also connects to other biblical passages where God is described as a shield, offering protection to His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>they perfected your beauty</b><br>The phrase "perfected your beauty" suggests that the military defenses and the presence of skilled warriors contributed to the overall splendor and reputation of Tyre. In the ancient world, a city's beauty was often associated with its strength and prosperity. This idea is echoed in other parts of Scripture where beauty and strength are linked, such as in the descriptions of Jerusalem. The emphasis on beauty also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Tyre, as its reliance on external appearances and alliances could not ultimately save it from judgment, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arvad.htm">Arvad</a></b><br>An island city located off the coast of modern-day Syria, known for its skilled seafarers and warriors.

Arvad was an island city just north of Tyre, and Helech (often linked with the same region) supplied seasoned seamen&#8211;soldiers. Their presence on every side of the wall shows how completely Tyre fortified herself (<a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>). What looks like smart international cooperation also hints at pride: rather than trusting the Lord, Tyre trusted hired strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the men of Gammad were in your towers</b><p>The watchtowers were the city&#8217;s highest points, reserved for the most trusted guards. Gammad (commonly connected with Gebal/Byblos) had craftsmen and warriors already working for Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>). Stationing them in the towers underscores Tyre&#8217;s strategy of placing elite forces where the battle would be fiercest. It also echoes how Israel sometimes turned to foreign help instead of God (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They hung their shields around your walls</b><p>Shields displayed on the battlements served a double purpose: instant readiness for combat and a showy parade of military hardware. The practice resembled Solomon&#8217;s golden shields in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16&#8211;17</a>) and the imagery of Song of Songs 4:4, where &#8220;a thousand shields hang on the tower of David.&#8221; What Tyre did physically, God&#8217;s people were to do spiritually&#8212;keep faith and obedience on display (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they perfected your beauty</b><p>From the street, the gleam of bronze or polished wood around the ramparts made the city look flawless. Earlier the Lord had called Tyre &#8220;perfect in beauty&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3&#8211;4</a>), yet the beauty was only skin-deep. God soon promised to scrape those walls bare (<a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>) and sink the ships that supplied her glory (<a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>). Earthly splendor without righteousness is a momentary shine that ends in judgment (<a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a> pictures Tyre at her military and cosmetic peak&#8212;foreign mercenaries on every wall, gleaming shields decorating the towers, and a city that looked invincible. The verse celebrates human ingenuity yet exposes its emptiness when separated from reliance on the Lord. What Tyre thought &#8220;perfected her beauty&#8221; merely set the stage for a greater fall, reminding us that true security and lasting splendor come only from faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The Gammadims were in thy towers.</span>--No people of this name is known, and it is extremely unlikely that the responsible posts upon the watch-towers would have been entrusted to foreigners. The word occurs only here, and is probably not a proper name, but should be translated <span class= "ital">brave men.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - (For <span class="cmt_word">Arvad</span>, see Ver. 8.) <span class="cmt_word">Gammadim</span>. The LXX. translates "guards" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Pygmies</span>, probably as connecting the name with <span class="accented">Gamad</span> (equivalent to "a cubit"). The Targum gives "watchmen;" Gesenius, "warriors:" Hitzig, "deserters." The name probably indicates that they were the flower of the Tyrian army - the life-guards (like the "Immortals" of the Persians) of the merchant-city. On the whole, we must leave the problem as one that we have no data for solving. The grouping with Arvad, however, suggests a Syrian or Phoenician tribe. <span class="cmt_word">They hanged their shields</span>. The custom seems to have been specially Phoenician. Solomon introduced it at Jerusalem (<a href="/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>). The sight of the walls thus decorated, the shields being sometimes gilt or painted, must have been sufficiently striking to warrant Ezekiel's phrase that thus the beauty of the city was "made perfect" by it. The custom reappears in 1 Macc. 4:57. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Arvad</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;wa&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_719.htm">Strong's 719: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arvad -- a city of Phoenicia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Helech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
