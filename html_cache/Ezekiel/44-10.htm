Their wandering signifies a departure from their sacred responsibilities. This phrase highlights the seriousness of their apostasy, as they were meant to be spiritual leaders. The Levites' unfaithfulness is a reflection of Israel's broader spiritual decline, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/2-8.htm">Malachi 2:8</a>, where the priests are rebuked for leading people astray.<p><b>when Israel went astray</b><br>This refers to the period of widespread idolatry and disobedience among the Israelites, which led to their exile. The historical context includes the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign and the subsequent idolatry that plagued both Israel and Judah. The phrase underscores the collective nature of the nation's sin, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>, where the reasons for Israel's exile are detailed.<p><b>and who wandered away from Me after their idols</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, often involving the worship of Canaanite gods like Baal and Asherah. This phrase indicates a deliberate choice to abandon God for false deities, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The Levites' participation in idolatry is particularly grievous given their role as spiritual leaders. This mirrors the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23-28</a> about the consequences of idolatry.<p><b>will bear the consequences of their iniquity</b><br>The consequences refer to the judgment and punishment that would come upon the Levites for their unfaithfulness. This is consistent with the principle of divine justice found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>, where the Israelites face consequences for their rebellion. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual restoration and purification of the priesthood, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>, where faithful Levites are promised a renewed role in temple service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe in Israel set apart for religious duties, particularly in the temple.
