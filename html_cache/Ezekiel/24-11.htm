The pot represents the city, and the coals signify the intense heat of God's wrath. In ancient times, setting a pot on coals was a method to purify or cleanse it, indicating that Jerusalem would undergo severe trials to purge its iniquities. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature where fire is used as a metaphor for purification and judgment (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>until it becomes hot and its copper glows</b><br>The heating of the pot until it glows suggests a thorough and complete process. Copper, a common material for pots in ancient Israel, requires significant heat to glow, symbolizing the intensity of the coming judgment. This reflects the thoroughness of God's refining process, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, where God refines His people in the furnace of affliction.<p><b>Then its impurity will melt within</b><br>The melting of impurity within the pot signifies the removal of sin and corruption from Jerusalem. This purification process is necessary for restoration. The imagery of melting impurity aligns with the biblical theme of God refining His people, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, where God refines them like silver and tests them like gold.<p><b>its rust will be consumed</b><br>Rust represents the accumulated sin and corruption of the people. The consumption of rust indicates the complete eradication of these impurities. This is a metaphor for the cleansing power of God's judgment, which is intended to restore holiness and righteousness. The concept of consuming rust parallels the idea of God as a consuming fire, as described in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, emphasizing His holiness and the necessity of purification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

It is unnecessary here to think of heat as removing the rust (scum) from the cauldron; the prophet's mind is not upon any physical effect, but upon the methods of purifying defiled metallic vessels under the law (see <a href="/numbers/31-23.htm" title="Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.">Numbers 31:23</a>). It was a symbolical rather than a material purification, and in the present case involved the actual destruction of the city itself. In <a href="/context/ezekiel/24-11.htm" title="Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.">Ezekiel 24:11-14</a>, the obduracy of the people is set forth in strong language, together with the completeness of the coming judgment in contrast to the in-effectiveness of all former efforts for their reformation (<a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm" title="In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.">Ezekiel 24:13</a>); and, finally, the adaptation of the punishment to the sin (<a href="/ezekiel/24-14.htm" title="I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 24:14</a>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The word translated "lies" in <a href="/ezekiel/24-12.htm" title="She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.">Ezekiel 24:12</a> means <span class= "ital">pains </span>or <span class= "ital">labour. </span>Translate, <span class= "ital">The labour is in vain; her rust does not go out of her, even her rust with fire. </span>In <a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm" title="In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.">Ezekiel 24:13</a> "lewdness" would be better rendered <span class= "ital">abomination.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then set it empty upon the coals</span>, etc. The empty cauldron is, of course, the city bereaved of its inhabitants.

When the punishment had done its full work, then Jehovah might cause his fury to rest (Ver. 13). Till then he declares, through the prophet, there will be no mitigation of the punishment.
