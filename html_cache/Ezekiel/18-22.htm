In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their collective disobedience and idolatry. This statement reassures them that individual repentance and righteousness can lead to forgiveness. Theologically, this reflects the principle found in <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes transgressions "as far as the east is from the west." It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of forgiveness through Christ, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where confession leads to cleansing from unrighteousness. The idea of not holding past sins against someone is a profound expression of grace, which is central to the Christian faith.<p><b>Because of the righteousness he has practiced,</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of personal responsibility and the active pursuit of righteousness. In the historical context, Ezekiel was addressing a people who believed in collective guilt and punishment. This statement shifts the focus to individual accountability, a theme also found in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that children should not be punished for the sins of their parents. The righteousness mentioned here is not merely legalistic adherence to the law but a genuine transformation of heart and behavior. This anticipates the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is dead, emphasizing that true faith results in righteous actions.<p><b>he will live.</b><br>The promise of life here is both literal and spiritual. In the immediate context, it suggests that those who turn from their wicked ways and practice righteousness will be spared from the consequences of sin, which often led to death or exile. Spiritually, this points to the abundant life promised by Jesus in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where He speaks of giving life to the full. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of eternal life offered through Christ, who is the ultimate source of life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The assurance of life for the righteous is a recurring theme in Scripture, reinforcing the hope and promise of salvation for those who follow God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, who were in exile due to their collective disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and source of forgiveness, emphasizing His desire for repentance and righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>The state of living in accordance with God's laws, which leads to life and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and relationship with God.

Here, again, at first sight, there seems to be an inconsistency between the Divine promise and the actual facts of the world. The penitent and forgiven sinner is continually seen to suffer through life from the consequences of his sin, as David's whole reign was overclouded with trouble and sorrow after his great sin in the matter of Bathsheba and Uriah. But here also it is the natural law continuing to work in subservience to a higher moral law. The natural consequences of any acts are not changed, or are only partially modified, by the subsequent moral state of him who has done them; but that moral state determines whether those consequences, however painful they may be in themselves, shall or shall not be really for his own highest gain. The absoluteness of the Divine forgiveness is seen by us, under the Christian dispensation, to be a necessary result of the ground on which it rests--the atonement of Christ. If the believer is truly united to Him by faith, he is a new creature (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>), and is looked upon no longer as a sinful son of Adam, but, as he is in reality, a member of the beloved and only-begotten Son of God. Hence his forgiveness must be complete, for his sins are atoned for, covered up, hidden from God's sight.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">None</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the transgressions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6588.htm">Strong's 6588: </a> </span><span class="str2">Transgression</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has committed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be held against him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yiz&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Because of the righteousness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1514;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6666.htm">Strong's 6666: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rightness, subjectively, objectively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has practiced,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he will live.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7717;&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">To live, to revive</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/18-22.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 18:22 None of his transgressions that he has (Ezek.
