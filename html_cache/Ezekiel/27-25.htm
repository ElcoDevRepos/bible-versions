Tarshish is often associated with a distant trading partner, possibly located in the western Mediterranean, such as modern-day Spain. These ships symbolize wealth and extensive trade networks. In biblical context, Tarshish is mentioned in connection with Solomon's and Jehoshaphat's fleets (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>), indicating a prosperous trade era. The mention of Tarshish here underscores the extensive reach and economic power of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city known for its maritime prowess and commercial success.<p><b>And you were filled with heavy cargo</b><br>The phrase "filled with heavy cargo" highlights the abundance and wealth accumulated through trade. Tyre's prosperity was largely due to its strategic location and its role as a central hub in the ancient world&#8217;s trade routes. The "heavy cargo" signifies not only the physical goods but also the economic and cultural influence Tyre wielded. This wealth, however, also led to pride and eventual judgment, as seen in the broader context of Ezekiel's prophecies against Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2-8</a>). The imagery of being "filled" suggests both prosperity and the potential for downfall due to overreliance on material wealth.<p><b>in the heart of the sea.</b><br>The phrase "in the heart of the sea" emphasizes Tyre's maritime dominance and its identity as a powerful island city. Geographically, Tyre was located on the coast of modern-day Lebanon, with part of the city on an island, making it a formidable naval power. The sea represents both the source of Tyre's wealth and its vulnerability. Biblically, the sea often symbolizes chaos and danger, and here it foreshadows the impending judgment and destruction prophesied by Ezekiel. The heart of the sea also connects to the idea of being surrounded and isolated, which can be seen as a metaphor for Tyre's eventual siege and downfall (<a href="/ezekiel/26-3.htm">Ezekiel 26:3-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Scripture pictures them as the super-freighters of the ancient world (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). By naming these ships, Ezekiel underscores the scale and prestige of Tyre&#8217;s trading network&#8212;only the best and largest fleets were sufficient for her commerce. The verse is therefore a literal statement about real ships that regularly docked at Tyre&#8217;s harbor, yet it also hints at the city&#8217;s pride in her global reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>carried your merchandise</b><p>Tyre&#8217;s livelihood depended on an immense variety of goods moving through her port&#8212;metals from Tarshish, spices from Arabia, textiles from Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12-24</a>). &#8220;Your merchandise&#8221; points to ownership and control: Tyre dictated prices and routes, prospering from every transaction. <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a> echoes this pattern when it lists the goods of another great trading power and laments their loss. Tyre&#8217;s merchandise symbolized both blessing&#8212;because trade is part of God&#8217;s mandate to fill and subdue the earth (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>)&#8212;and temptation, as wealth can seduce the heart (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you were filled with heavy cargo</b><p>&#8220;Filled&#8221; pictures the holds crammed to capacity, the very decks pressed low by abundance. Tyre literally became rich beyond measure (<a href="/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Ezekiel 28:5</a>), but heavy cargo can overbalance a ship. <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> warns, &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall.&#8221; <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a> recounts the rich fool whose barns were bursting yet whose soul was bankrupt. Tyre&#8217;s fullness foreshadows the moment when the weight of prosperity would help drag her down.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the heart of the sea</b><p>Tyre&#8217;s island stronghold sat &#8220;in the heart of the sea&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a>), giving her both protection and peril. While the waters shielded her from land attacks, they also exposed her to storms and, ultimately, to divine judgment announced from the very waves that sustained her (<a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>). The phrase stresses the literal geography while conveying spiritual truth: no fortress, however central or secure, can stand when God&#8217;s verdict arrives (<a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of Tyre at her commercial zenith: the largest ships on earth docking at her piers, every hold stuffed with goods, the city riding high in the Mediterranean. Yet each clause carries a sober undertone. The same Tarshish ships that showcased her glory would later mourn her fall (<a href="/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29-32</a>). Her merchandise, once a badge of success, became a weight too heavy to bear. And her proud location in the sea could not save her from the wave of judgment God unleashed. The verse therefore calls readers to recognize that wealth, influence, and strategic advantage are gifts to be stewarded under God&#8217;s rule, never idols to be trusted, for only He grants lasting security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Ships of Tarshish</span> means simply, <span class= "ital">ships of the largest size,</span> such as were fitted for the voyage to Tarshish: as we now say, "East Indiaman."
