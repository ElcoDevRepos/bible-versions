It emphasizes the authority of God as the ultimate source of the prophecy. In the biblical context, prophets were often called to deliver messages of judgment or hope. This phrase underscores the role of Ezekiel as a mouthpiece for God, highlighting the seriousness and divine origin of the message.<p><b>Behold, I am against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt:</b><br>Here, God declares His opposition to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine or semi-divine figures in Egyptian culture, often seen as gods on earth. This declaration of divine opposition would have been a significant affront to Pharaoh's perceived authority and divinity. It also reflects the historical enmity between Egypt and Israel, as Egypt was often a place of refuge or oppression for the Israelites.<p><b>O great monster who lies among his rivers:</b><br>The "great monster" likely refers to a crocodile or a mythical creature like a dragon, symbolizing chaos and power. In Egyptian culture, the Nile was central to life and prosperity, and the crocodile was a powerful symbol associated with the god Sobek. This imagery portrays Pharaoh as a formidable but ultimately controllable force. Biblically, it echoes themes of God&#8217;s sovereignty over chaos, similar to His control over Leviathan in other scriptures.<p><b>who says, &#8216;The Nile is mine; I made it myself.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase highlights Pharaoh's arrogance and self-deification, claiming ownership and creation of the Nile, which was the lifeblood of Egypt. It reflects the pride and hubris that often led to divine judgment in the Bible. Theologically, it contrasts with the biblical teaching that God is the Creator of all things. This claim of self-sufficiency and divine status is reminiscent of other biblical figures who were judged for their pride, such as Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The verse warns every generation that earthly power cannot rival the Creator; boasting in achievements instead of worshiping God invites His judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The great dragon</span>.--This word is usually translated <span class= "ital">dragon</span> in the English version, but sometimes <span class= "ital">whale</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>), and (in a slightly modified form) <span class= "ital">serpent</span> (<a href="/context/exodus/7-9.htm" title="When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.">Exodus 7:9-10</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-12.htm" title="For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.">Exodus 7:12</a>).

The expression "his rivers," used of the branches of the Nile near its mouth, is peculiarly appropriate to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, to which Pharaoh-Hophra belonged, whose capital was Sais, in the midst of the Delta.<p><span class= "bld">My river is mine own.</span>--This is characteristic of the pride of Hophra, who, according to Herodotus, was accustomed to say that "not even a god could dispossess him of power." The whole dynasty to which he belonged, beginning with Psammeticus, improved the river and encouraged commerce with foreign nations, thereby acquiring great wealth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The great dragon</span>. The word is cognate with that used in <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> for the great "whales," monsters of the deep. The "dragon," probably the crocodile of the Nile (compare the description of "leviathan" in <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>.) had come to be the received prophetic symbol of Egypt (<a href="/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">rivers</span> are the Nile-branches of the Delta. <span class="cmt_word">My river is mine own</span>. The words probably imply that Hophra, like his grandfather Necho, in his plan of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, had given much time and labor to irrigation works in Lower Egypt. The boast which rose to his lips reminds us of that of Nebuchadnezzar as he looked on Babylon (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>). He, like the kings of Tyre and Babylon, was tempted to a self-apotheosis, and thought of himself as the Creator of his own power.
