In the context of Ezekiel, "she" refers to Jerusalem, representing the people of Israel. The comparison to "the nations" underscores the gravity of their sin, as Israel was chosen to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>) and a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). Their rebellion is seen as more egregious because they had the Law and the prophets, unlike the surrounding nations. This echoes the theme of Israel's unfaithfulness found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>, where Israel's lack of knowledge and rejection of God is lamented.<p><b>and against My statutes worse than the countries around her</b><br>The "statutes" refer to the specific laws given by God to Israel, which were meant to set them apart (<a href="/leviticus/18-4.htm">Leviticus 18:4-5</a>). The "countries around her" were pagan nations that did not have the same covenantal relationship with God. Israel's failure to uphold God's statutes is seen as a betrayal of their unique calling. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>, where Israel is called to observe God's laws as a testimony to the nations. Their failure to do so not only dishonors God but also diminishes their witness.<p><b>For her people have rejected My ordinances</b><br>The rejection of God's ordinances indicates a willful disobedience and a turning away from the covenant. This is not merely a failure to follow rules but a deeper spiritual apostasy. The ordinances were meant to guide Israel in righteousness and justice (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>). The rejection is reminiscent of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's commands. This rejection is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, where God laments the people's refusal to listen to His words.<p><b>and have not walked in My statutes.</b><br>"Walking" in the statutes implies living a life in accordance with God's laws, a metaphor for daily conduct and lifestyle. The failure to walk in God's statutes suggests a complete departure from the path of righteousness. This imagery is common in the wisdom literature, such as in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-2</a>, where the blessed man is described as one who delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night. The failure to walk in God's ways is a central issue in the prophetic critique of Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9-11</a>, where the people are described as rebellious and unwilling to hear the instruction of the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The phrase &#8220;rebelled against My ordinances&#8221; highlights willful defiance, not mere failure. Ezekiel has already dramatized this rebellion with the hair-shaving sign (<a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>), picturing the city&#8217;s coming judgment. Their refusal echoes earlier warnings: &#8220;The LORD, the God of their fathers, repeatedly sent word to them&#8230; but they mocked God&#8217;s messengers&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). Rebellion, then, is personal&#8212;against &#8220;My ordinances,&#8221; not an abstract code.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>more wickedly than the nations</b><p>Shockingly, God says His covenant people out-sinned the pagans. Compare Israel&#8217;s idolatry in <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>: &#8220;They rejected His statutes&#8230; and followed worthless idols, so they became worthless.&#8221; <a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a> reminds us, &#8220;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&#8221; Covenant privilege brings higher accountability. When those with the most light choose darkness, their deeds become &#8220;more wicked.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and against My statutes worse than the countries around her</b><p>The surrounding nations never received Sinai&#8217;s revelation, yet Judah surpassed them in evil. <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a> underscores the principle: &#8220;You only have I chosen&#8230; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.&#8221; Jesus later applies the same standard to cities that saw His miracles (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21-24</a>). Possession of God&#8217;s Word multiplies responsibility; spurning it intensifies guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For her people have rejected My ordinances</b><p>Rejection is deliberate. <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a> records a similar verdict: &#8220;They have not listened to My words and have rejected My law.&#8221; The people despised God&#8217;s clear directives about worship, justice, and morality, preferring syncretism and self-rule. <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a> labels them &#8220;rebellious people, deceptive children, children unwilling to obey the LORD&#8217;s instruction.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have not walked in My statutes</b><p>Disobedience moved from attitude to lifestyle. <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a> declares, &#8220;You have not followed My statutes or kept My ordinances; instead you have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.&#8221; Obedience is a walk&#8212;daily, observable, practical (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Judah chose a different path, so judgment would meet them in the streets where they walked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/5-6.htm">Ezekiel 5:6</a> exposes covenant infidelity in five escalating statements: rebellion, surpassing pagan wickedness, deeper statutory violation, outright rejection, and an ungodly walk. With greater revelation comes greater responsibility; when God&#8217;s people renounce His Word, His justice must answer. The verse calls every believer to cherish, obey, and walk in God&#8217;s ordinances lest we repeat Jerusalem&#8217;s tragic example.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Changed my judgments into wickedness.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">hath wickedly resisted my judgments, </span>the sense adopted by most modern expositors.<p><span class= "bld">More than the nations.</span>--Not, of course, absolutely, but in proportion to the knowledge and the privileges given them. It would be an exaggeration to say that the Israelites were actually more evil in their life than the surrounding heathen; for they were, no doubt, far better. Even of those cities which our Lord, at a later day, so strongly upbraided, it would be absurd to suppose that they equalled Sodom and Gomorrah in their iniquity. God's judgments are always relative and proportioned to the opportunities He has granted to men. The point is that the Israelites had <span class= "ital">resisted His judgments </span>more than the heathen; they had sinned against greater light.
