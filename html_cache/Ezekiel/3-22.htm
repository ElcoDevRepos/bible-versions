The "hand of the LORD" symbolizes God's authority and guidance, often seen in prophetic contexts (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>). It signifies empowerment for the task ahead, ensuring that Ezekiel's actions and words are under divine direction. This divine touch is crucial for the prophet's mission, emphasizing that his message is not self-derived but from God.<p><b>and He said to me</b><br>This phrase underscores the direct communication between God and Ezekiel, highlighting the personal nature of God's relationship with His prophets. It reflects the biblical theme of God speaking to His chosen messengers, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). This direct speech is a hallmark of prophetic literature, affirming the authenticity and authority of the message conveyed.<p><b>Get up, go out to the plain</b><br>The instruction to "get up" suggests urgency and readiness to obey God's command. The "plain" refers to a specific geographical location, possibly a flat, open area outside the city, conducive for solitude and reflection. In biblical times, plains were often places of significant encounters with God (e.g., <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>, where God appeared to Abram). This setting away from distractions allows Ezekiel to focus on God's revelation, emphasizing the importance of solitude in receiving divine messages.<p><b>and there I will speak with you</b><br>This promise of communication assures Ezekiel of further divine revelation. It highlights the progressive nature of God's revelation, where understanding unfolds over time. The phrase also reflects the biblical pattern of God choosing specific locations for significant revelations, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>) and Elijah on Mount Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>). This encounter foreshadows the intimate relationship between God and His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), bridging the gap between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who directly communicates with Ezekiel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plain.htm">The Plain</a></b><br>A specific location where God instructs Ezekiel to go, symbolizing a place of solitude and divine encounter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_the_lord.htm">The Hand of the LORD</a></b><br>A phrase indicating God's power, presence, and guidance upon Ezekiel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_communication.htm">Divine Communication</a></b><br>The event where God speaks directly to Ezekiel, emphasizing the importance of obedience and attentiveness to God's voice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was instructed to go to the plain, we must be willing to follow God's directions, even when they lead us to unfamiliar or uncomfortable places.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_solitude.htm">The Importance of Solitude</a></b><br>God often speaks to us in moments of solitude, away from distractions.

Psychologically, it seems probable that the effect of the message was to fill him with an overwhelming, crushing sense of the burden of his responsibility. How was he to begin so terrible a work? What were to be the nearer, and the remoter, issues of such a work? Apparently, at least, he does not then begin it by a spoken warning. He passes, at the Divine command borne in on his soul, from the crowd that had watched him during the seven days' silence, and betakes himself to the solitude of the "plain," as distinct from the "mound" where the exiles dwelt, and there the vision appears again in all points as he had seen it when he stood on the river's bank. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
