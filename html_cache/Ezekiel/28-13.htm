It suggests a state of innocence and beauty, often associated with the pre-fall condition of humanity. The mention of Eden here is symbolic, possibly referring to the high status and privileged position of the figure being addressed, often interpreted as a reference to the King of Tyre or a representation of Satan before his fall. The garden of God signifies a place of divine fellowship and abundance, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8-15</a>.<p><b>Every kind of precious stone adorned you:</b><br>The imagery of precious stones signifies beauty, wealth, and honor.

Gold's association with the divine is seen throughout scripture, such as in the construction of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>).<p><b>prepared on the day of your creation.</b><br>This phrase indicates intentionality and purpose in the creation of the being addressed.

The verse underscores three truths: the reality of Edenic fellowship, the lavish honor originally granted, and the clear distinction between the Creator and His creature. All serve to expose pride as a tragic misuse of God-given splendor and to warn every reader that beauty without humility invites certain downfall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Every precious stone.--</span>There is some uncertainty in regard to the names of some of these stones (as sardius may be <span class= "ital">carnelian,</span> and beryl <span class= "ital">chrysolite</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> but the general fact is an allusion to the profuse use of precious stones as ornaments of their royal apparel by Oriental monarchs. The stones mentioned are the same with those in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="/exodus/39-10.htm" title="And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.">Exodus 39:10</a>), the third row being omitted; this is supplied in the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">Thy pipes.</span>--The word occurs only here, and its most probable sense is <span class= "ital">females,</span> those who played upon the tambourines. All these things did not need to be collected by the king of Tyre, but were ready prepared to his hand at the moment of his accession to the throne, just as everything was made ready for Adam in Eden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast been in Eden</span>, etc. The words are suggestive, as showing that Ezekiel was familiar with the history of <a href="/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>. and 3. (compare the mention of Noah, in <a href="/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>:14, 20). To him the King of Tyre seemed to claim a position like that of Adam before his fall, perfect in beauty and in wisdom, the lord of the creation. And in that fancied Eden he stood, so he thought, not like Adam, "naked and ashamed," but like one of the cherubim that guarded the gates of the primeval Paradise (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), covered with all imaginable splendor. Ezekiel returns to the phrase in <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8, 16, 18</a> and Ezekiel 36:35. Other instances meet us in <a href="/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Every precious stone.</span> All the stones named are found in the list of the gems on the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8-14</a>). Three, however, of those gems are wanting - those in the third row of the breastplate - which are not named elsewhere; and the order is not the same. The LXX. makes the two lists identical, apparently correcting Ezekiel by Exodus. St. John (<a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>) reproduces his imagery in his vision of the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem, but naturally returns to the fullness of the symbolic number - twelve. Possibly the description of gold and bdellium and onyx (or beryl), as in <a href="/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11, 12</a>, may have suggested the thought that Eden was a land of jewels. <span class="cmt_word">The workmanship of thy tabret and pipes</span>; better, <span class="accented">the service</span>. The Authorized Version and Revised Version follow Luther. Keil agrees as to "tabret" (so <a href="/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; elsewhere, as in <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a> and <a href="/job/21-12.htm">Job 21:12</a>, the Authorized Version gives "timbrels"), but takes the latter word (not found elsewhere) as identical with its feminine form, and meaning "female." He sees in the clause, accordingly, a picture of the pomp of the Tyrian king, surrounded by the odalisques of the harem, who, with their timbrels, danced to his honor as their lord and king (camp. <a href="/isaiah/23-16.htm">Isaiah 23:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). Havernick, who agrees with Keil, calls attention to a passage in Athenaeus (12:8. p. 531), in which Strafe, a Sidonian king, is said to have prepared for a great festival by bringing girls who played on the flute and harp from all parts of Greece. Others, however (Smend), find in both the words articles of jewelry, pearls perforated or set in gold (as in <a href="/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and so see in them the conclusion of the description of the gorgeous apparel of the king. Furst takes the words as meaning musical instruments that were of gold set with jewels. Ewald, following out the Urim and Thummim idea, takes the gems as the subject of the sentence, and translates, "they were for the work of thine oracles and divining." On the whole, the interpretation given above seems preferable. <span class="cmt_word">In the day that thou wast created</span>. The words point to the time of the king's enthronement or coronation. It was then that he appeared in all his supreme magnificence. Had Ezekiel been a witness of that ceremony? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in Eden,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1448;&#1491;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7695;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
