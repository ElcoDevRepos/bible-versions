In biblical times, a name represented one's identity and authority. God's name being "great" signifies His supreme power and sovereignty. The holiness of His name reflects His purity, righteousness, and separateness from sin. This declaration is a response to the desecration of His name by His people, Israel, and serves as a promise of restoration and divine intervention. The holiness of God's name is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>, where God acts for the sake of His name.<p><b>which has been profaned among the nations</b><br>The profaning of God's name among the nations refers to the actions and behaviors of the Israelites that led to God's name being disrespected and dishonored. This occurred when Israel, chosen to be a light to the nations, failed to uphold God's laws and commandments, leading to their exile. The nations viewed Israel's defeat and exile as a reflection of their God's weakness. This phrase highlights the importance of God's people living in a way that honors Him, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>, where God commands His people not to profane His holy name.<p><b>the name you have profaned among them</b><br>This part of the verse directly addresses the Israelites, holding them accountable for their actions that led to the profanation of God's name. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where Israel's disobedience and idolatry brought shame to God's name. The historical context includes Israel's repeated failure to remain faithful to God, leading to their punishment and exile. This serves as a reminder of the responsibility of God's people to uphold His name through their conduct, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58-59</a>.<p><b>Then the nations will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This phrase points to the ultimate purpose of God's actions: to reveal His identity and sovereignty to all nations. The acknowledgment of God as the LORD (Yahweh) by the nations signifies a recognition of His supreme authority and power. This is a fulfillment of God's promise to make Himself known to the world, as seen in <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>, where God declares His intention to show His power and proclaim His name throughout the earth. It also foreshadows the universal recognition of God in the eschatological future, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) combines the titles of God's sovereignty and covenant faithfulness. It assures the fulfillment of His promises and the execution of His divine will. This phrase is often used in prophetic literature to underscore the seriousness and divine origin of the message, as seen throughout the book of Ezekiel.<p><b>when I show My holiness in you before their eyes</b><br>God's holiness will be demonstrated through the transformation and restoration of His people, Israel. This transformation will serve as a testimony to the nations of God's power and faithfulness. The phrase "before their eyes" indicates a public and undeniable display of God's work, leading to the recognition of His holiness. This transformation is a type of the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who through His life, death, and resurrection, revealed God's holiness and provided a way for humanity to be restored to a right relationship with God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations surrounding Israel, who witnessed Israel's unfaithfulness and God's subsequent judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_reputation.htm">God's Holiness and Reputation</a></b><br>God's primary concern is the sanctity of His name.

Here He is not merely teaching about holiness; He is putting it on display for all to witness.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;great name&#8221; recalls passages such as <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory.&#8221; The point is that everything God does aims at magnifying who He is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which has been profaned among the nations</b><p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s rebellion dragged God&#8217;s name through the mud. When the covenant people were exiled, the surrounding nations mocked, assuming Israel&#8217;s God was powerless (<a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Profaning the name means treating what is sacred as common (<a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>).

This keeps grace front and center.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the nations will know that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The repeated purpose clause in Ezekiel&#8212;&#8220;then they will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (over 60 times)&#8212;highlights the mission: universal recognition of Yahweh&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s acts of judgment and restoration both serve this end (<a href="/ezekiel/25-17.htm">Ezekiel 25:17</a>; 39:28).

As Israel's dispersion had caused that Name to be profaned, so Israel's restoration would secure that it should be magnified among the heathen (<a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>), who should learn from this event that their previous ideas of Jehovah, as a feeble and local divinity, had been wrong. The question whether your eyes, as in the Hebrew text, or "their eyes," as in many ancient versions, should be read is debated. The latter reading appears to be demanded by the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of Ezekiel (see <a href="/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), and is adopted by both English versions as well as by interpreters of eminence; but other expositors of equal name adhere to the former reading on the ground that the sanctifying of Jehovah's Name in the eyes of Israel was an indispensable preliminary to its sanctification in the eyes of the heathen. Havernick regards "their eyes" as "an obvious emendation to relieve a difficulty," to which in no case should criticism accord the preference; while Keil gives it the preference, though admitting that "your eyes" can be justified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will show the holiness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qid&#183;da&#353;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
