In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the east was often associated with the direction of the rising sun, symbolizing new beginnings and divine presence. Biblically, the east gate of the temple is particularly significant as it is traditionally associated with the return of God's glory to the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-5</a>). This gate facing east also connects to the prophecy of the Messiah's return, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, where the Mount of Olives, located east of Jerusalem, is mentioned. The east gate's orientation may also symbolize the entrance of God's light and truth into the world.<p><b>and climbed its steps</b><br>The presence of steps leading up to the gate suggests a sense of elevation and reverence, as one ascends towards a holy place. In ancient temple architecture, steps often indicated a transition from the common to the sacred. This ascent can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual elevation and preparation to enter into God's presence. The act of climbing steps also reflects the physical and spiritual effort required to approach holiness, reminiscent of the psalms of ascent (Psalms 120-134), which were sung by pilgrims as they ascended to Jerusalem.<p><b>He measured the threshold of the gate to be one rod deep</b><br>The act of measuring in Ezekiel's vision signifies God's order and precision in the construction of His temple. A rod, approximately 10.5 feet or 3.2 meters, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient times. The specific measurement of the threshold underscores the importance of exactness in God's design, reflecting His holiness and the need for purity in worship. This measurement can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the cornerstone and foundation of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). Just as the threshold is foundational to the gate, Christ is foundational to the faith. The act of measuring also connects to the prophetic visions in <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>, where measuring the temple signifies God's protection and ownership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_measuring_rod.htm">The Man with the Measuring Rod</a></b><br>This figure, often interpreted as an angelic being, guides Ezekiel through the vision of the temple, measuring its dimensions and features.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eastern_gate.htm">The Eastern Gate</a></b><br>A significant part of the temple structure in Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing the direction from which God's glory returns to the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-5</a>).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_vision.htm">The Temple Vision</a></b><br>A detailed vision given to Ezekiel, representing a future idealized temple, often interpreted as a symbol of God's presence and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rod.htm">The Rod</a></b><br>A measuring tool used by the man to measure the temple, symbolizing precision and divine order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_east.htm">Symbolism of the East</a></b><br>The east often symbolizes new beginnings and the return of God's presence.

The other gates were like it, but this is described first, because it had the pre-eminence. It looked straight to the door of the Temple itself; it was by this that the glory of the Lord was afterwards seen to enter His house (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:">Ezekiel 43:1</a>); and in consequence this gate was to be kept shut, except for the prince (<a href="/context/ezekiel/44-2.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.">Ezekiel 44:2-3</a>). The accompanying plan may be a help in understanding the description. Notwithstanding the minuteness of detail in the text, a few points remain undetermined; but the plan represents the main features correctly, and gives the most probable view of the parts that are not entirely settled.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">The stairs.--</span>These steps to the porch were seven in number (<a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm" title="And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.">Ezekiel 40:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm" title="And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on the posts thereof.">Ezekiel 40:26</a>) for the north and south gates, and therefore probably also for this.

The text of this verse becomes clearer by omitting the words in italics which are not in the original; also throughout the description it is better to omit the inserted words <span class= "ital">was</span> and <span class= "ital">were,</span> since the various things mentioned are all dependent upon <span class= "ital">measured.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">east gate</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The gate which looketh toward the east</span>; literally, <span class="accented">whose face was toward the east</span>. That this was not the gate in which the angel had been first observed standing seems implied in the statement that he came to it.
