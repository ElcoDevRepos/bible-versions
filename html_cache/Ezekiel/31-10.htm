In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to the prophet, conveying messages of judgment and hope. This particular message is directed towards Egypt, using the metaphor of a great tree to symbolize its power and pride. The phrase underscores the importance of listening to God's words, as they carry ultimate authority and truth.<p><b>Since it became great in height</b><br>The imagery of a tree growing tall is symbolic of Egypt's rise to power and prominence among the nations. In the ancient Near East, trees often represented strength and stability. The height of the tree signifies the extent of Egypt's influence and dominance. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages where nations or leaders are likened to trees, such as in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a> with Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great tree.<p><b>and set its top among the clouds,</b><br>This phrase suggests arrogance and self-exaltation. In ancient cultures, reaching the heavens or clouds was often associated with divine status or challenge to God's authority. The Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) is a parallel example where humanity's attempt to reach the heavens resulted in divine judgment. The imagery here indicates that Egypt, like the tree, has overstepped its bounds, aspiring to a position reserved for God alone.<p><b>and it grew proud on account of its height,</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, often leading to downfall. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that "pride goes before destruction." Egypt's pride in its achievements and status is a direct challenge to God's sovereignty. This pride is not just a personal failing but a national one, reflecting a broader cultural attitude that disregards God's authority. The Bible consistently teaches that humility is valued by God, while pride leads to judgment, as seen in the stories of Lucifer (Isaiah 14) and King Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign ruler and ultimate authority, who speaks through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, tasked with delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>Often symbolized by the great cedar tree in this chapter, representing a powerful and prideful nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The immediate context of the prophecy, as Ezekiel is addressing Pharaoh and Egypt, using Assyria as a cautionary example.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cedar_tree.htm">The Cedar Tree</a></b><br>A metaphor for Assyria's greatness and subsequent downfall due to pride.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride can lead to a false sense of security and self-sufficiency, ultimately resulting in downfall.

The future may also have been used because the object of this parable is not Assyria, but Egypt, whose fall was still to come.

The ground of the judgment upon Assyria is its pride, on which <a href="/context/2_kings/18-32.htm" title="Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.">2Kings 18:32-35</a> may be considered a commentary. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast lifted up thyself</span>.
