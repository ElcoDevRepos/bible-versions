In biblical times, raising one's hand was a gesture associated with making a vow or oath, indicating the seriousness and binding nature of the declaration. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to emphasize the certainty and authority of God's promises and judgments (e.g., <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>).<p><b>I swore to them in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness refers to the period of Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, a time marked by rebellion and disobedience. This setting is crucial as it highlights the context of Israel's repeated failures to trust and obey God despite His continuous provision and guidance. The wilderness experience is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing both testing and divine discipline (<a href="/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26-35</a>).<p><b>that I would scatter them among the nations</b><br>This phrase predicts the dispersion of the Israelites due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. The scattering among the nations is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, where God warned Israel of the consequences of breaking His covenant. Historically, this prophecy was realized through the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, where the Israelites were forcibly removed from their land.<p><b>and disperse them throughout the lands</b><br>The dispersion throughout various lands underscores the extent of Israel's punishment, emphasizing the loss of national identity and unity. This scattering served as both a judgment and a means of preserving a remnant that would eventually return and restore the nation. Theologically, this dispersion foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church being scattered throughout the world, tasked with spreading the Gospel (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-4</a>). Additionally, it points to the ultimate regathering and restoration of Israel as prophesied in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were often rebellious and disobedient, leading to their punishment and exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The period of Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, marked by testing and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the foreign lands where the Israelites would be scattered due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_oath.htm">God's Oath</a></b><br>The solemn promise made by God, emphasizing the seriousness of His intentions and the certainty of His actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_god's_promises.htm">The Seriousness of God's Promises</a></b><br>God's promises, whether of blessing or judgment, are certain and should be taken seriously.

This scattering&#8212;historically realized in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles&#8212;demonstrates that God&#8217;s word is certain, His holiness uncompromising, and yet His covenant mercy still at work, preserving a remnant and promising eventual restoration for all who turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">I would scatter them among the heathen.--</span>This threatening was not designed to be fulfilled in that immediate generation, as abundantly appears from <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-27.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.">Deuteronomy 4:27</a>, Deut. 27:64, and the other passages in which it is given, especially Deuteronomy 29, 30. It was given to that generation as representing the nation, but was only to be carried out when, by a long course of obdurate sin, it should be shown to be imperatively required. The threat had now been already realised in part, and was on the eve of being fully accomplished. It was important that the people should be made to understand that this had been the Divine warning from the beginning, and that in its fulfilment they were only receiving that punishment which had always been designed for such sin as they had committed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I would scatter them among the heathen.</span> The words seem to refer to the generation that had grown up in the wilderness, and, so taken, do not correspond with the history of the conquest of Canaan. What Ezekiel contemplates, however, as the resolve of Jehovah, is the commutation of the sentence of destruction for that of the dispersion of the people, leaving the time and manner of that dispersion to be determined by his own will. Possibly even in the time of the judges, with its many conquests and long periods of oppression, there were instances of such dispersion, and these, with others that would naturally accompany an invasion like that of Shishak (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-9</a>), not to speak of frequent attacks from Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, Edomites, and Syrians, may have seemed to the prophet the working out, step by step, of the dispersion which culminated in the deportation of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser, and of Judah and Benjamin by Nebuchadnezzar.
