The number "two hundred" suggests a manageable and fair expectation, ensuring that the burden of sacrifice is not too heavy on any individual. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and giving according to one's means, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>. The sheep, a common sacrificial animal, symbolizes innocence and purity, prefiguring Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>from the well-watered pastures of Israel</b><br>The mention of "well-watered pastures" emphasizes the abundance and fertility of the land, a blessing from God. This imagery recalls the Promised Land described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The pastures signify God's provision and the responsibility of the Israelites to offer back to God from the best of what He has given them. This also connects to the idea of spiritual nourishment and growth, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where God leads His people to green pastures.<p><b>These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings</b><br>This phrase outlines the types of offerings required, each with distinct purposes. Grain offerings symbolize dedication and thanksgiving to God, burnt offerings represent atonement and complete surrender, and peace offerings signify fellowship and reconciliation with God. These offerings collectively point to the comprehensive nature of worship and atonement in the Old Testament, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who fulfills all these offerings (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>to make atonement for the people</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, addressing the separation caused by sin. In the Old Testament, atonement was achieved through sacrifices, which temporarily covered sins. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ's atoning work on the cross, providing a once-for-all sacrifice for sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>). The concept of atonement underscores God's holiness and the necessity of a mediator, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase asserts divine authority and the certainty of God's word. The use of "declares the Lord GOD" emphasizes that these instructions are not merely human traditions but commands from the sovereign Creator. It reflects the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's message, where God directly communicates His will to His people. This assurance of divine authority is echoed throughout Scripture, affirming the reliability and truth of God's promises (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, focusing on judgment and restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often symbolizing His people, who are called to live in covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/well-watered_pastures.htm">Well-watered pastures</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's provision and blessing, representing the abundance from which offerings are to be made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings.htm">Offerings (Grain, Burnt, Peace)</a></b><br>Sacrificial practices in the Old Testament that symbolize worship, atonement, and fellowship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process of reconciling with God, often through sacrifice, to cover sin and restore relationship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifice.htm">Understanding Sacrifice</a></b><br>Recognize the significance of sacrificial offerings in the Old Testament as a means of atonement and worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Reflect on how God provides abundantly for His people, symbolized by the well-watered pastures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/atonement_and_reconciliation.htm">Atonement and Reconciliation</a></b><br>Consider the importance of atonement in restoring our relationship with God, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_sacrifices.htm">Living Sacrifices</a></b><br>Apply the concept of offerings to our lives today by dedicating ourselves wholly to God as living sacrifices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Acknowledge the communal aspect of offerings, where each member contributes to the spiritual well-being of the whole.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_45_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 45:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_45_15_Offerings_role_today.htm">How does Ezekiel 45:15 emphasize the importance of offerings in worship today?

Just as Abel brought &#8220;the firstlings of his flock&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>), the people are called to offer the choicest part first, not last.

Because the flock thrives under His care (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>), they can freely yield an offering. God never demands what He has not first supplied (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the grain, burnt, and peace offerings</b><p>Three distinct sacrifices are supplied:<p>&#8226; Grain offering&#8212;expressing gratitude and devotion (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Burnt offering&#8212;wholly consumed to symbolize complete surrender (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Peace offering&#8212;celebrating fellowship with God (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-5</a>).<p>Together they paint a full picture of worship: thanksgiving, consecration, and communion, all ultimately fulfilled in Christ, &#8220;an offering and a sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To make atonement for the people</b><p>&#8220;Atonement&#8221; speaks of covering sin so restored fellowship becomes possible (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).

The blood of the sheep pointed forward; the blood of the Lamb of God paid in full (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declares the Lord GOD</b><p>The verse ends with divine authority.

Ultimately, the verse calls God&#8217;s people&#8212;then and now&#8212;to honor Him with the first and best of what He has already provided, confident that His declared word is both gracious and binding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/45-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sheep shall be given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#347;eh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
