The name "Tel-abib" means "mound of the flood" or "hill of ears of grain," suggesting a place of renewal or growth amidst desolation. This setting underscores the theme of exile and displacement, as the Israelites were taken from their homeland due to their disobedience to God. The exiles represent the remnant of Israel, a recurring theme in the prophetic books, highlighting God's continued faithfulness despite judgment.<p><b>who dwelt by the River Kebar</b><br>The River Kebar is a canal near Nippur in ancient Babylon, where many Jewish exiles lived. This location is significant as it represents the physical and spiritual distance from Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and identity. The Kebar Canal is mentioned several times in Ezekiel, serving as a backdrop for his visions and prophecies. The setting by the river may evoke imagery of the Israelites' earlier captivity in Egypt, drawing a parallel between the two periods of bondage and God's deliverance.<p><b>And for seven days I sat where they sat</b><br>The act of sitting for seven days is reminiscent of the mourning period observed in Jewish culture, known as "shiva." This period of mourning reflects Ezekiel's deep empathy and identification with the exiles' suffering. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting that Ezekiel's time among the exiles was a complete immersion into their experience, preparing him for his prophetic ministry.<p><b>and remained there among them, overwhelmed</b><br>Ezekiel's overwhelming experience indicates the weight of the prophetic calling and the gravity of the message he was to deliver. This emotional response highlights the human aspect of the prophets, who often bore the burden of God's message with great personal cost. The term "overwhelmed" suggests a profound spiritual and emotional impact, akin to the reactions of other prophets like Jeremiah, who lamented over the fate of his people. This phrase also foreshadows the intense visions and messages Ezekiel would receive, emphasizing the seriousness of his mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The verse teaches that faithful servants of God must identify with those they serve, absorb the weight of God&#8217;s message, and wait on the Lord before speaking&#8212;because only then can they convey heaven&#8217;s Word with authenticity and compassion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">I came to them of the captivity at Telabib.</span>--Ezekiel now leaves the place where he had been, and comes to Tel-abib, which is described as still by the same "river of Chebar," and which signifies the "mound of ears (of grain)," and was probably a place of especial fruitfulness, but which cannot be further identified. It appears to have been the central place of the captivity.<p><span class= "bld">I sat where they sat </span>is an expression of so much difficulty in the Hebrew, that it has given rise to various readings in the manuscripts, and to a marginal correction which has been followed by the English.

By this act the prophet shows his deep sympathy with his people in their affliction. This week of silent meditation among those to whom he was commissioned to speak corresponds, as already said, to the week of the consecration of his fathers to their priestly office (Leviticus 8). Such a season of retirement and thought has been given to other great religious leaders--to Moses, in his forty years of exile; to Elijah, in his forty days in Mount Horeb (<a href="/context/1_kings/19-4.htm" title="But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.">1Kings 19:4-8</a>); to St. Paul, in his journey to Arabia (<a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>); and to our Lord Himself, when He went into the wilderness after His baptism. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Tel-Abib,</span> etc., We now enter on the first scene of the prophet's ministry. The LXX. leaves the proper name. The Vulgate rightly translates it as <span class="accented">acervus novarum frugum</span>, the "mound of ears of corn" (the meaning appears in the name of the Passover month, Abib). Luther gives, strangely enough, "where the almond trees stood, in the mouth Abib"). Jerome's suggestion, that here also there was a <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> and that those who shared Ezekiel's exile were regarded as the "firstfruits" of the future, is at least ingenious, and finds some support in <a href="/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>. The place has not been identified, and its position depends on that of the river with which it is connected (see note on Ezekiel 1:1). The word "Tel" is commonly applied to the mounds formed out of masses of ruins, which are common all over the plains of Mesopotamia. The name in this case may suggest that the earth had gathered over it, and that it was cultivated. <span class="cmt_word">I sat where they sat</span>, etc. The ministry begins not with speech, but silence. Our Western habits hardly enable us to enter into the impressiveness of such a procedure. The conduct of Job's friends (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>) presents a parallel, and as Ezekiel seems to have known that book (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>), he may have been influenced by it.
