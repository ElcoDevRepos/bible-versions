Historically, Elam was a significant power, often in conflict with Assyria and Babylon. The "resting place" among the slain signifies judgment and defeat, a common theme in prophetic literature where nations opposing God&#8217;s people face divine retribution. The imagery of graves "all around" suggests total destruction and the end of Elam's power and influence.<p><b>All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was once spread in the land of the living.</b><br>In the Old Testament, circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people, Israel. To be "uncircumcised" symbolically represents being outside of God's covenant and favor. The phrase "slain by the sword" indicates a violent end, often used in prophetic texts to describe divine judgment. Elam's "terror" refers to its former might and influence, which has now been nullified, emphasizing the transient nature of earthly power.<p><b>They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.</b><br>The "Pit" is a metaphor for Sheol, the abode of the dead in Hebrew thought. Bearing "disgrace" indicates a loss of honor and status, a common fate for those judged by God. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where the proud and powerful are brought low. It also echoes the fate of other nations and individuals who opposed God, as seen in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>They are placed among the slain.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the completeness of Elam's judgment. Being "placed among the slain" signifies not only physical death but also spiritual and eternal separation from God. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of living in opposition to God's will, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
