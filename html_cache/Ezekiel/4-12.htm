Barley was a common grain in ancient Israel, often associated with the food of the poor. This act symbolizes the dire conditions and scarcity of food that would occur during the siege of Jerusalem. Barley cakes were a staple, simple to make, and represented basic sustenance. The use of barley here underscores the theme of judgment and the humbling of the people.<p><b>after you bake it over dried human excrement</b><br>The use of human excrement as fuel for baking is a shocking and defiling act, intended to convey the severity of the coming judgment. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, using human waste was considered unclean and abhorrent, highlighting the desperation and degradation that would accompany the siege. This act serves as a vivid illustration of the defilement and impurity that the Israelites would experience due to their disobedience. It also reflects the extreme conditions of famine and the lack of resources.<p><b>in the sight of the people.</b><br>Ezekiel's actions were to be performed publicly, serving as a prophetic sign to the people of Israel. This public demonstration was meant to capture attention and provoke reflection on their spiritual state and the consequences of their actions. The visibility of the act emphasizes the role of the prophet as a messenger and a living symbol of God's warnings. It also serves as a call to repentance, urging the people to recognize the seriousness of their situation and turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The words have been thought to determine that the whole transaction was an actual symbolic act and not a vision; but this does not follow. It need only have been a part of the vision that what was done was done publicly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall bake it with dung</span>, etc. The process of baking in ashes was as old as the time of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>), and continues in Arabia and Syria to the present day. The kneaded dough was rolled into thin flat cakes, and they were placed upon, or hung over, the hot wood embers of the hearth or oven. But in a besieged city the supply of wood for fuel soon fails. The first resource is found, as still often happens in the East, in using the dried dung of camels or of cattle. Before Ezekiel's mind there came the vision of a yet more terrible necessity. That supply also might tail, and then men would be forced to use the dried contents of the "draught houses" or cesspools of Jerusalem. They would be compelled almost literally to fulfil the taunt of Rabshakeh (<a href="/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a>). That thought, as bringing with it the ceremonial pollution of <a href="/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>: 7:21, was as revolting to Ezekiel as it is to us; but like Dante, in a like revolting symbolism ('Inf.,' 18:114), he does not shrink from naming it. It came to him, as with the authority of a Divine command, that he was even to do this, to represent the extreme horrors of the siege. And all this was to be done visibly, before the eyes of his neighbours at Tel-Abib. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you shall eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1499;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;a&#774;&#183;len&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the food]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as you would a barley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8184.htm">Strong's 8184: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barley</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cake,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1490;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;u&#183;&#7713;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5692.htm">Strong's 5692: </a> </span><span class="str2">A disc or cake of bread</span><br /><br /><span class="word">after you bake</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1490;&#1462;&#1430;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#8216;u&#183;&#7713;e&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5746.htm">Strong's 5746: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it over dried human</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">excrement</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7713;el&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1561.htm">Strong's 1561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dung</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the sight [of the people].&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - cdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/4-12.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 4:12 You shall eat it as barley cakes (Ezek.
