Throughout the book of Ezekiel, this statement is repeated to underscore that the events prophesied are meant to reveal God's power and holiness. The acknowledgment of God as LORD is a central theme in the Old Testament, often following acts of judgment or deliverance (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>). It signifies a deeper understanding and acceptance of God's identity and His rightful place as the ruler over all creation.<p><b>when I have made the land a desolate waste</b><br>The desolation of the land is a direct consequence of the people's sins. In the historical context, this refers to the Babylonian conquest and the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 586 BC. The land, once flowing with milk and honey, becomes barren as a result of divine judgment. This desolation serves as a physical manifestation of spiritual decay and is a common theme in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>). Archaeological evidence supports the widespread destruction and depopulation during this period.<p><b>because of all the abominations they have committed.</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to the idolatry and moral corruption that the Israelites engaged in, which violated their covenant with God. These abominations included idol worship, child sacrifice, and other practices borrowed from surrounding pagan cultures (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6-18</a>). The historical context shows that these practices were prevalent in Judah, leading to God's judgment. Theologically, this highlights the seriousness of sin and the necessity of repentance. The prophetic message calls for a return to faithfulness and purity, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who cleanses from all unrighteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.
