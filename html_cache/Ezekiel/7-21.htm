Historically, this refers to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, where the Babylonians, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, seized the wealth of the city and the temple. This act of handing over is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>, where God warns Israel of foreign invasion if they disobey His commandments. Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God over nations and His use of them as instruments of judgment.<p><b>and loot to the wicked of the earth</b><br>The "wicked of the earth" refers to the Babylonians, known for their ruthless military campaigns and idolatrous practices. This phrase highlights the moral corruption of those who would benefit from Israel's downfall. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin, both for Israel and for the nations used by God to execute His judgment. The looting of Jerusalem's treasures, including those from the temple, symbolizes the desecration of what was once holy and set apart for God, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a> and <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>.<p><b>who will defile them</b><br>The defilement mentioned here is both physical and spiritual. Physically, the sacred items of the temple would be taken and used for profane purposes, as seen when Belshazzar used the temple vessels during his feast in <a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2-4</a>. Spiritually, the defilement represents the loss of Israel's sanctity and the profanation of what was meant to be holy. This defilement is a direct consequence of Israel's own idolatry and unfaithfulness, as they had already defiled themselves with foreign gods, leading to their judgment. Theologically, it points to the need for a true and lasting purification, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who cleanses and restores what is defiled by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, specifically the people of Judah who are facing impending judgment due to their idolatry and sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Refers to the invading nations, particularly the Babylonians, who will conquer and plunder Israel as a part of God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_of_the_earth.htm">The Wicked of the Earth</a></b><br>These are the ungodly nations and peoples who will take possession of Israel's treasures, symbolizing the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/defilement.htm">Defilement</a></b><br>The act of desecrating what was once holy, indicating the spiritual and physical degradation that will occur as a result of Israel's sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Israel's idolatry led to their treasures being handed over to foreigners.
