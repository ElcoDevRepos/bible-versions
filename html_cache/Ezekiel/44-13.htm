In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the Levites who went astray when Israel went after idols. The role of a priest was to mediate between God and the people, a sacred duty requiring holiness and obedience. The restriction underscores the importance of purity and faithfulness in those who serve God. This echoes the broader biblical theme that God requires holiness from those who minister before Him, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6-8</a>.<p><b>or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things</b><br>The distinction between "holy things" and "most holy things" reflects the gradations of holiness in the temple. The "holy things" could include offerings and sacrifices, while the "most holy things" might refer to the inner sanctum of the temple, such as the Holy of Holies. This separation emphasizes the sanctity of God's presence and the need for reverence. The restriction on access to these sacred items highlights the consequences of unfaithfulness and the need for repentance and restoration, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's exile and return.<p><b>They will bear the shame of the abominations they have committed</b><br>This phrase addresses the consequences of sin, specifically idolatry and unfaithfulness. The term "abominations" often refers to idolatrous practices that were detestable to God. Bearing shame indicates a public acknowledgment of wrongdoing and its repercussions. This concept is consistent with the prophetic literature, where sin leads to judgment, but also offers a path to redemption through repentance. The idea of bearing shame is also seen in the New Testament, where Christ bears the shame of humanity's sin on the cross, offering a way for reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and a key figure in delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, specifically those who went astray, are the focus of this verse.
