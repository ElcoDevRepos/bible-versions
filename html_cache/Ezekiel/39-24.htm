The terms "uncleanness" and "transgressions" indicate both ritual impurity and moral rebellion. In the Old Testament, uncleanness often refers to violations of the purity laws found in Leviticus, which were meant to set Israel apart as holy. Transgressions denote willful disobedience to God's commandments. This judgment is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to divine retribution. The historical context involves the Babylonian exile, a direct consequence of Israel's failure to uphold the covenant. This phrase also echoes the prophetic warnings given by earlier prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who called the nation to repentance. Theologically, it underscores God's holiness and justice, as He cannot tolerate sin.<p><b>and I hid My face from them</b><br>The concept of God hiding His face is a metaphor for the withdrawal of His favor and presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the face of a deity symbolized blessing and protection. When God hides His face, it signifies a break in the relationship, leading to vulnerability and suffering. This idea is rooted in the blessings and curses of the Mosaic Covenant, where God's presence is contingent upon Israel's obedience. The hiding of God's face is a recurring theme in the Psalms and prophetic literature, often associated with lament and a call for repentance. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin but also as an invitation to seek restoration. In the broader biblical narrative, this concept finds resolution in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, through His atoning work, restores the broken relationship between God and humanity, ensuring that believers will never be forsaken.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
