In the context of Ezekiel, it points to the day when Jerusalem would fall to the Babylonians. This aligns with the prophetic timeline given by Ezekiel, who had been warning of Jerusalem's destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness. The phrase "on that day" is frequently used in prophetic literature to denote a significant event in God's redemptive plan, similar to "the day of the Lord" found in other prophetic books.<p><b>a fugitive</b><br>The term "fugitive" indicates someone who has escaped from a disaster or calamity. In this context, it refers to a survivor from the siege of Jerusalem. Historically, when cities were conquered, a few would escape to bring news of the event. This aligns with the historical practice of messengers or survivors bringing reports of battles or sieges. Theologically, the fugitive serves as a witness to the fulfillment of God's word through Ezekiel, emphasizing the certainty of divine prophecy.<p><b>will come</b><br>This phrase suggests the certainty and inevitability of the event. The coming of the fugitive is a fulfillment of God's word, demonstrating His sovereignty over historical events. The arrival of the fugitive is not just a random occurrence but a divinely orchestrated event to confirm Ezekiel's prophecies. This reflects the biblical theme of God's control over time and history, ensuring that His purposes are accomplished.<p><b>and tell you the news</b><br>The news refers to the fall of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in Israel's history. This news would confirm Ezekiel's prophecies and serve as a turning point for the exiles in Babylon. Theologically, the announcement of Jerusalem's fall is a moment of realization and repentance for the people, as it confirms the warnings given by the prophets. This also prefigures the role of the Gospel, where the "good news" of salvation through Christ is proclaimed, bringing a message of hope and redemption. The act of telling news is a recurring biblical motif, emphasizing the importance of testimony and witness in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the central figure in this book, delivering God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fugitive.htm">The Fugitive</a></b><br>This refers to a messenger who escapes the destruction of Jerusalem to bring news to Ezekiel.
