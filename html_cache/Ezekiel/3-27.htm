In the context of biblical prophecy, God often spoke directly to His prophets, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8-9</a>). This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of the message Ezekiel is to deliver.<p><b>I will open your mouth</b><br>Ezekiel's role as a prophet is emphasized here, as God empowers him to speak. This is reminiscent of other instances where God enables His servants, such as when He touched Jeremiah's mouth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). The opening of Ezekiel's mouth signifies the divine origin of his message, contrasting with false prophets who speak from their own imagination (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>and you are to tell them, &#8216;This is what the Lord GOD says.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase establishes the source of the message as the sovereign Lord, emphasizing the authority and seriousness of the prophecy. This formula is common in prophetic literature, ensuring that the audience understands the message is not from the prophet himself but from God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>).<p><b>Whoever listens, let him listen;</b><br>This echoes the call to heed God's word, a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>). It implies a choice and responsibility on the part of the hearer, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and whoever refuses, let him refuse,</b><br>The phrase acknowledges human free will and the reality of rejection. It reflects the consistent biblical theme that while God offers His word, individuals have the choice to accept or reject it (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>). This also foreshadows the rejection of Christ by many during His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>for they are a rebellious house.</b><br>This characterizes the Israelites' historical pattern of rebellion against God, as seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>). It sets the stage for understanding the context of Ezekiel's ministry, which occurs during a time of exile and judgment due to Israel's persistent disobedience. This rebellion is a type of the broader human condition of sin and resistance to God, which is ultimately addressed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Ezekiel does not decide when to speak; he waits until the Lord addresses him. The same pattern appears with Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Jeremiah&#8217;s call (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;7</a>). This underscores that revelation is never man-made but divinely delivered (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Because Scripture is inspired, we can trust that every word truly comes from God and carries His full authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will open your mouth</b><p>The prophet&#8217;s ability to speak is literally under God&#8217;s control. Earlier, the Lord said He would make Ezekiel&#8217;s tongue cling to the roof of his mouth so he could not rebuke the people at will (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>). Now God promises to loosen that tongue at the appointed moment. Similar scenes appear when the Lord touched Isaiah&#8217;s lips with a coal (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6&#8211;7</a>) and when He placed His words in Jeremiah&#8217;s mouth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). These examples show that God equips His servants for the exact task He assigns (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you are to tell them, &#8216;This is what the Lord GOD says.&#8217;</b><p>The prophet&#8217;s message is not personal opinion; it is the unfiltered declaration of the Sovereign LORD. That refrain&#8212;&#8220;This is what the Lord GOD says&#8221;&#8212;echoes throughout Ezekiel (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>; 6:3; 12:10), emphasizing divine authorship. The unchanging standard remains: &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; carries absolute weight (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). In every generation, God&#8217;s spokesmen must transmit, not edit, His Word (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever listens, let him listen</b><p>Once the message is delivered, individuals are responsible for their response. Jesus later used the same principle: &#8220;He who has ears, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>). Faith comes by hearing God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), and obedient listeners find blessing, as seen in those who heeded Noah (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>) or repented at Jonah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whoever refuses, let him refuse</b><p>God allows people the freedom to reject His Word, yet refusal never nullifies truth. Pharaoh hardened his heart despite repeated warnings (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>), and many in Jesus&#8217; day turned back (<a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). Ezekiel is not held accountable for their disbelief; his duty is faithfulness, not results (<a href="/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Ezekiel 3:18&#8211;19</a>). This safeguards the messenger from despair and keeps the focus on obedience to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they are a rebellious house</b><p>The root problem is spiritual rebellion, the same reality that plagued Israel since Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>) and still infects humanity (<a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10&#8211;12</a>). By labeling them &#8220;a rebellious house,&#8221; God diagnoses the condition that only repentance can cure (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30&#8211;32</a>). The warning is severe, but it springs from a loving desire to restore (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a> highlights a divine chain of communication: God speaks, God empowers, and the prophet proclaims. The audience then must choose either obedient listening or obstinate refusal, revealing their heart condition. The verse reassures faithful messengers that their role is to relay God&#8217;s literal, authoritative Word and leave the results with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">When I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth.</span>--To this Ezekiel evidently refers in <a href="/ezekiel/24-27.htm" title="In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 24:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm" title="Now the hand of the LORD was on me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.">Ezekiel 33:22</a>, when, after the destruction of Jerusalem, his mouth should no longer be shut. But until then, although he should be greatly restrained in his ordinary utterances by the opposition of the people, yet there would be times when God would give him a message with such power that he would be constrained to declare it, whether the people would hear or whether they would forbear. Such messages are those contained in this book, which at this point begin to be recorded. By all this the difficulties and trials under which the prophet must exercise his office are clearly and strongly set before him. (See Excursus I., "On the Figurative and Symbolical Language of Ezekiel.")<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I speak with thee,</span> etc. This then, as ever, was the condition of the prophet's work. He was to speak out of his own heart. When the "time to speak" came words would be given him (<a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>). And those he would then speak would be as the echo of those in ver. 11. In our Lord's words (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9</a>) we have, it may be, a deliberate reproduction of Ezekiel's formula.
