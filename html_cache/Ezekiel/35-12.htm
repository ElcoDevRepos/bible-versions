The "mountains of Israel" symbolize the land and the people of Israel, often representing the spiritual and physical heritage of the Israelites. The contemptuous words reflect the hostility and arrogance of the surrounding nations, particularly Edom, towards Israel. This is a reminder of God's covenant with Israel and His promise to protect and vindicate them. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God hearing the cries and concerns of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God hears the cries of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>when you said, &#8216;They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!&#8217;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the opportunistic attitude of Israel's enemies, who see the desolation of Israel as a chance to seize and consume the land. Historically, this reflects the period after the Babylonian exile when the land of Israel was vulnerable. The phrase "given to us to devour" indicates a belief that the downfall of Israel was a divine allowance for other nations to take over. This attitude is condemned by God, as it disregards His sovereignty and the future restoration He has planned for Israel. The desolation mentioned here is temporary, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36.htm">Ezekiel 36</a>, where God promises to restore the land and bring His people back. This also serves as a type of Christ, who, despite being rejected and seemingly defeated, ultimately triumphs and restores His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

They believed Israel&#8217;s God was weak; His seeming absence during Israel&#8217;s exile emboldened them. The coming judgment will reverse that illusion, forcing them to acknowledge the covenant-keeping LORD who never abdicates His throne (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, every historical fulfillment of God&#8217;s word is a fresh reminder that our faith rests on a God who consistently makes Himself known.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have heard every contemptuous word you uttered</b><p>Words matter to God because they reveal the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s speech dripped with scorn and triumphalism. God notes not &#8220;some&#8221; but &#8220;every&#8221; word&#8212;total recall that guarantees total accountability (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Contempt for God&#8217;s people is contempt for God Himself (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). The same principle protected Israel when Balaam tried to curse them (<a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>) and still guards the church (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This clause comforts the righteous: slander does not evaporate into the air; it is recorded in heaven, and vindication will come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the mountains of Israel</b><p>The phrase places Edom&#8217;s hostility in geographic and covenantal focus.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Mountains of Israel&#8221; symbolizes the land promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). Threatening the land challenges God&#8217;s covenant fidelity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a> immediately turns to blessing those same mountains, contrasting Edom&#8217;s curse with God&#8217;s restoration plan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>-13 documents Edom&#8217;s violence when Judah was weak, looting and gloating at the crossroads. That attitude provoked divine jealousy (<a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; For every believer, this reminds us that God&#8217;s people&#8212;though dispersed, disciplined, or distressed&#8212;are never abandoned real estate; they remain His inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when you said, &#8216;They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!&#8217;</b><p>Edom interpreted Israel&#8217;s desolation as divine permission.

Such opportunism exposes a heart eager to exploit another&#8217;s discipline.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s reply in <a href="/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14-15</a> flips the script: the reproach Edom hurled will return on their own land.<p>&#8226; The devouring language mirrors earlier predator imagery (<a href="/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3-10</a>). God alone assigns inheritance; human greed masquerading as destiny will be overturned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a> proclaims that the LORD hears, remembers, and responds to every proud word spoken against His covenant people. Edom&#8217;s contempt will become the very evidence that forces them to acknowledge His lordship.
