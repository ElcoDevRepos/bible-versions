The term "your people" refers to the Israelites, who are in exile in Babylon at this time. This context is crucial as it reflects the people's need for understanding and guidance during a period of displacement and uncertainty. The role of a prophet often involved addressing the questions and concerns of the people, serving as a conduit for divine revelation.<p><b>&#8216;Won&#8217;t you explain to us</b><br>The request for explanation underscores the people's lack of understanding regarding the symbolic actions or messages delivered by Ezekiel. This reflects a broader theme in the prophetic literature where God&#8217;s messages are often conveyed through visions, symbols, or parables that require interpretation. The need for explanation also points to the spiritual blindness or hardness of heart that the Israelites often exhibited, necessitating a clear and direct interpretation from the prophet.<p><b>what you mean by these?&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "what you mean by these" refers to the symbolic act or vision that Ezekiel has presented to the people. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, this likely pertains to the vision of the valley of dry bones and the joining of two sticks, representing the reunification of Israel and Judah. This vision is a powerful metaphor for restoration and resurrection, themes that resonate throughout the Bible. The request for meaning highlights the importance of prophetic symbolism in conveying God's promises and plans. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration, foreshadowing the ultimate reunification and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile in Babylon, seeking understanding and hope for their future.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_dry_bones.htm">The Valley of Dry Bones</a></b><br>A vision given to Ezekiel symbolizing the restoration of Israel, preceding this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_sticks.htm">The Two Sticks</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, these represent the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which God promises to reunite.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, representing a period of judgment and purification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_symbols.htm">Understanding Prophetic Symbols</a></b><br>The importance of seeking understanding of God's messages, as the Israelites did, encourages us to delve deeper into Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>Just as God promised to restore Israel, He offers hope and restoration in our lives today, regardless of our circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The reunification of Israel and Judah foreshadows the unity believers have in Christ, breaking down divisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The fulfillment of God's promises in Ezekiel reminds us of His control over history and His faithfulness to His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_faith.htm">Active Faith</a></b><br>Like Ezekiel, we are called to be active participants in God's plan, sharing His messages and living out our faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_37_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 37:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_37_18_God_s_unity_plan.htm">How does Ezekiel 37:18 illustrate God's plan for unity among His people?

The suggestion that such a request would be preferred to Ezekiel makes it clear he was meant to perform the symbolic action in public. That his countrymen should fail to understand this action accorded with their proverbial dullness of apprehension (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a>). In explanation, the prophet was enjoined to <span class="cmt_word">say unto them</span>, while holding the sticks in his hand, that just as he had made the sticks one in his hand, so would God make one in his hand the two kingdoms symbolized by the sticks. The union of the sticks was to be Ezekiel's work (ver. 17, "in thy hand"); the union of the kingdoms should be Jehovah's (ver. 19, "in my hand"). The separation of the kingdoms had been Ephraim's doing ("in the hand of Ephraim"); their combination should be God's ("in my hand"). Their severance had been effected, on the part of Ephraim, by an unlawful breaking off from the house of Judah, and the establishment of an independent kingdom; their unification should be brought about by the putting down of Ephraim, and the confirming of the crown rights of Judah. The translation, <span class="cmt_word">And will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah</span>, signifying "And will put the tribes of Israel with him." <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tribe of Judah, supported by the LXX., and preferred by Ewald, Smend, and others, is superior to that of the Revised Version margin, "And will put them together with it, unto [or, ' to be'] the stick of Judah."
