In the context of Ezekiel, God appointed him as a watchman for Israel, tasked with warning the people of impending judgment. The role of a watchman was crucial in ancient cities, where they would alert inhabitants of approaching danger. This duty parallels the Christian responsibility to share the gospel and warn others of spiritual peril.<p><b>and he does not turn from his wickedness and his wicked way</b><br>The concept of repentance is central here. The Hebrew word for "turn" (shuv) implies a complete change of direction, both morally and spiritually. The dual mention of "wickedness" and "wicked way" underscores the depth of the individual's sin, encompassing both actions and lifestyle. This reflects the biblical theme that true repentance involves a transformation of both heart and behavior, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a> and <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>.<p><b>he will die in his iniquity</b><br>This phrase highlights the consequence of unrepentant sin, which is spiritual death. The Bible consistently teaches that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). In Ezekiel's context, this also had immediate implications, as the Israelites faced physical destruction and exile due to their persistent rebellion. Theologically, this points to the ultimate judgment awaiting those who reject God's offer of salvation.<p><b>but you will have saved yourself</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the accountability of the messenger. Ezekiel's faithfulness in delivering God's warning absolves him of responsibility for the people's response. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to faithfully proclaim the truth, leaving the results to God (<a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>). It underscores the importance of obedience to God's call, regardless of the outcome.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

If the wicked refuse, they suffer the consequences of their sin, yet the faithful watchman is vindicated. The verse calls believers today to loving boldness&#8212;sounding the alarm clearly, trusting God with the results, and resting in the assurance that obedient witness pleases Him and preserves the messenger from guilt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast delivered thy soul,</span> etc. This phrase is again an eminently characteristic one (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/33-9.htm">Ezekiel 33:9</a>). Here also, though the words do not necessarily imply more than deliverance from bodily death, thought of as a judgment for negligence, it is, I think, scarcely possible to avoid finding in them a "springing and germinant" sense, analogous to that which we have found in the preceding verse. The dread warning has for its complement a message of comfort. The judgment passed on the prophet does not depend on the results of his ministry. "Whether men will bear, or whether they will forbear," he has "delivered his soul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> saved his life, when he has done his duty as a watchman. The phrase is noticeable as having passed out of the language of Scripture into familiar use. A man can say, "Liberavi animam meam," when he has uttered his conviction on any question of importance affecting the well being of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
