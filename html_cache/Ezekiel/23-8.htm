The imagery of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to describe idolatry and unfaithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>). The reference to Egypt recalls Israel's early history, where they were influenced by Egyptian idolatry and practices (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>). This historical context highlights the persistent nature of Israel's spiritual infidelity, which began during their time in Egypt and continued despite God's deliverance and covenant relationship with them.<p><b>when men slept with her in her youth</b><br>The "youth" of Israel refers to the early period of the nation's history, particularly during their time in Egypt. This metaphorical language indicates the early adoption of idolatrous practices. The "men" symbolize the foreign nations and their gods, with whom Israel engaged in spiritual adultery. This reflects the cultural and religious influences that Israel encountered and adopted, contrary to God's commands (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>caressed her virgin bosom</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intimate and personal nature of Israel's idolatry. The "virgin bosom" suggests purity and innocence that was corrupted by idolatrous practices. The imagery of caressing indicates a deep, personal involvement in these practices, highlighting the betrayal of their covenant with God. This can be connected to the idea of Israel as God's chosen people, meant to be set apart and holy (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>and poured out their lust upon her</b><br>The pouring out of lust signifies the complete and overwhelming nature of Israel's idolatry. It suggests an abandonment to sinful desires and a total immersion in pagan practices. This phrase underscores the severity of Israel's unfaithfulness and the depth of their spiritual corruption. The imagery of lust also connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual adultery, where Israel's relationship with God is likened to a marriage covenant that they have broken (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively.

The reference to Egypt in this verse highlights Israel's long-standing history of unfaithfulness, beginning from their time in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/harlotry.htm">Harlotry</a></b><br>This term is used metaphorically to describe Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. It signifies the spiritual adultery of turning away from God to worship other deities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/youth.htm">Youth</a></b><br>Refers to the early period of Israel's history, particularly during their time in Egypt, when they first began to adopt idolatrous practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Symbolic of the foreign nations and their gods with whom Israel engaged in idolatry and unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adultery.htm">Spiritual Adultery</a></b><br>Just as Israel was unfaithful to God by turning to idols, Christians today must guard against anything that takes the place of God in their hearts, whether it be materialism, relationships, or ideologies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Israel's alliances with foreign nations led to spiritual compromise.
