In the context of Ezekiel, this is a prophetic message about the Israelites' return from exile. The act of remembering is significant in the Hebrew tradition, often associated with repentance and turning back to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-3</a>). It suggests a deep introspection and acknowledgment of past sins.<p><b>and all the deeds with which you have defiled yourselves,</b><br>The deeds refer to the idolatry and disobedience that led to Israel's exile. Defilement in the Old Testament often relates to ritual impurity and moral corruption (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). This phrase underscores the gravity of their actions against God's covenant. The historical context includes the worship of foreign gods and the adoption of pagan practices, which were prevalent in Israel before the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and you will loathe yourselves</b><br>This self-loathing is a profound expression of remorse and contrition. It reflects a genuine repentance, where the Israelites not only recognize their sins but also feel deep sorrow for them. This is consistent with the biblical theme of godly sorrow leading to repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). The cultural context of the time viewed such self-reflection as necessary for restoration and reconciliation with God.<p><b>for all the evils you have done.</b><br>The evils refer to the collective sins of the nation, including idolatry, injustice, and breaking the covenant with God. This acknowledgment is crucial for the process of redemption and restoration. Theologically, it points to the need for atonement and the hope of forgiveness, which is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The prophetic nature of Ezekiel's message foreshadows the ultimate redemption and purification of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land given by God to the Israelites, from which they were exiled due to their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment_and_mercy.htm">God's Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>The overarching theme of Ezekiel's prophecies, highlighting both the consequences of sin and the hope of restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Remembering past sins is crucial for genuine repentance and transformation.

The word &#8220;There&#8221; roots the experience in a real geographic location and a real moment in prophetic history, showing that repentance is not abstract but bound to God&#8217;s tangible fulfillment of His promises (<a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-40</a>; <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will remember your ways</b><p>&#8226; God intends His people to recall their past choices with clarity, not to shame them endlessly but to bring them to honest reckoning (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Memory becomes a tool of grace: when blessings in the land contrast with former rebellion, the heart awakens to the goodness of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the deeds with which you have defiled yourselves</b><p>&#8226; The phrase widens from &#8220;ways&#8221; to &#8220;deeds,&#8221; spotlighting specific actions&#8212;idolatry, injustice, and covenant breaking (<a href="/ezekiel/6-9.htm">Ezekiel 6:9</a>; 16:15-22).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Defiled yourselves&#8221; underscores that sin is not merely external; it stains the inner person (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/mark/7-20.htm">Mark 7:20-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will loathe yourselves</b><p>&#8226; Genuine repentance produces godly sorrow, a revulsion toward sin and its residue (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; This self-loathing is not self-hatred for its own sake but a refusal to cling to the old, corrupted self (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for all the evils you have done</b><p>&#8226; The confession is comprehensive&#8212;nothing is excused or minimized (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By owning &#8220;all&#8221; their evils, the people align with the Lord&#8217;s righteous assessment and become ready for restoration (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a> portrays the moment when restored Israel, standing on covenant soil, looks back, remembers every sinful path and deed, feels holy disgust toward those evils, and thereby enters deep, authentic repentance. God orchestrates this memory and remorse so His people will treasure His mercy, walk in obedience, and live free from the defilements that once enslaved them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">Ye shall lothe yourselves.</span>--The especial sin above all others for which Israel had been reproved in past ages, and which still formed the burden of Ezekiel's denunciations, was idolatry; from this they were weaned, once for all, at the restoration, and whatever other sins may have been committed by them, into this, as a nation, they have never since relapsed.<p>With <a href="/ezekiel/20-44.htm" title="And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have worked with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 20:44</a> this prophecy ends, and here the chapter closes in the Hebrew and in the ancient versions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall ye remember</span>, etc. The words stretch far and wide, and throw light on many of the problems that connect themselves with the conversion of the sinner and the eschatology of the Divine government. The whole evil past is still remembered after repentance and forgiveness. There is no water of Lethe, such as the Greeks fabled, such as Dante dreamt of as the condition of entering Paradise ('Purg.,' 31:94-105). The self-loathing and humility which grow out of that memory, the acceptance of all the punishment of the past as less than had been deserved, - these are the conditions and safeguards of the new blessedness. Ezekiel teaches us, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, that it is possible to conceive of an eternal punishment, the punishment of memory, shame, self-loathing, as compatible with eternal life. So (in ver. 44) the prophet ends what is perhaps, the profoundest and the noblest of his discourses, his "vindication of the ways of God to man." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will remember</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;z&#601;&#183;&#7733;ar&#183;tem-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
