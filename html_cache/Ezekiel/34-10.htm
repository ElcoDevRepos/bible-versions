In the prophetic tradition, the phrase underscores that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This is a common introduction in prophetic literature, indicating the seriousness and divine backing of the forthcoming pronouncement.<p><b>Behold, I am against the shepherds:</b><br>The "shepherds" symbolize the leaders of Israel, such as kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for the people. The imagery of shepherds is frequently used in the Bible to describe leaders (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>). God's opposition to them indicates their failure in their duties, leading to the suffering and scattering of the people.<p><b>and I will demand from them My flock:</b><br>God holds the leaders accountable for their stewardship. The flock represents the people of Israel, whom God considers His own. This reflects the biblical principle of accountability, where leaders are responsible for the well-being of those they lead (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>and remove them from tending the flock:</b><br>This signifies a divine judgment and removal of authority from the unfaithful leaders. Historically, this can be seen in the fall of Jerusalem and the exile, where the political and religious leaders lost their positions. It also foreshadows the coming of a new shepherd, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>so that they can no longer feed themselves:</b><br>The leaders were exploiting their positions for personal gain, neglecting the needs of the people. This phrase highlights the corruption and self-interest that had become prevalent among the leaders. The removal of their authority is also a removal of their ability to exploit the people.<p><b>For I will deliver My flock from their mouths:</b><br>God promises to rescue His people from the exploitation and harm caused by their leaders. This deliverance is both a physical and spiritual salvation, pointing to God's ongoing care and protection for His people. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who saves His people from sin and spiritual death.<p><b>and it will no longer be food for them:</b><br>The imagery of the flock being "food" for the shepherds underscores the extent of the leaders' exploitation. God's intervention ensures that His people will no longer be preyed upon. This reflects God's justice and His commitment to the welfare of His people, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God as a protector and provider.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and divine authority who speaks against the shepherds, representing His ultimate power and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the leaders of Israel, such as kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for the people but failed in their duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, who were supposed to be cared for and protected by their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often depicted as a flock in need of guidance and protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event where God declares His intention to hold the leaders accountable and to rescue His people from their neglect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_of_leaders.htm">Accountability of Leaders</a></b><br>God holds leaders accountable for their actions, especially when they neglect their responsibilities.

His word is final and authoritative, echoing the prophetic formula found throughout Scripture (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>). When God begins with this solemn declaration, we know the following statements carry absolute weight and certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, I am against the shepherds</b><p>Here, &#8220;shepherds&#8221; refers to Israel&#8217;s leaders&#8212;kings, priests, and prophets&#8212;tasked with caring for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/numbers/27-16.htm">Numbers 27:16-17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). Instead of protecting the flock, they exploited it (<a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>; <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>). God&#8217;s direct opposition&#8212;&#8220;I am against&#8221;&#8212;is a sobering reality that parallels His stance against corrupt leadership elsewhere (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>).
