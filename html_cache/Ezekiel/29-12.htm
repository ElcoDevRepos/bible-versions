The desolation signifies a complete devastation, reducing Egypt to a state similar to other lands that have faced God's wrath. This prophecy aligns with the historical context of Egypt's decline during the 6th century BC, particularly under the Babylonian conquest led by Nebuchadnezzar. The imagery of desolation is reminiscent of other biblical judgments, such as those against Babylon and Edom, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>and her cities will lie desolate for forty years among the ruined cities</b><br>The specific mention of "forty years" is significant, as the number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or judgment in the Bible, such as Israel's forty years in the wilderness. This period of desolation for Egypt suggests a complete but temporary judgment, after which restoration is possible. Historically, this could refer to the period of Babylonian dominance when Egypt's influence waned. The mention of "ruined cities" underscores the totality of the destruction, aligning with the fate of other cities that opposed God's will.<p><b>And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations</b><br>The dispersion of the Egyptians is a form of divine punishment, similar to the exile experienced by the Israelites. This scattering serves as a humbling process, stripping Egypt of its national identity and power. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God using exile as a means of correction and eventual restoration. The dispersion also highlights the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics, where displaced populations were common due to conquests and shifting empires.<p><b>and scatter them throughout the countries</b><br>This scattering throughout various countries indicates a loss of unity and strength for Egypt, as its people are forced to live among foreign nations. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of pride and reliance on earthly power rather than on God. This scattering can be seen as a type of the ultimate dispersion of humanity due to sin, with the hope of eventual gathering and restoration through Christ. The scattering of Egypt parallels the fate of other nations that opposed God's plans, reinforcing the message of divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

By placing Egypt &#8220;among desolate lands,&#8221; God underscores that even the most fertile and secure nation can be reduced to barrenness when He judges (<a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This prophecy parallels earlier warnings: &#8220;The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;Behold, I will punish Amon of Thebes&#8230;and all who trust in Pharaoh&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The disaster is not random; it is divine retribution for Egypt&#8217;s arrogance against God and His people (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and her cities will lie desolate for forty years among the ruined cities</b><p>&#8226; Forty years is a literal time span&#8212;long enough for a full generation to pass (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). Just as Israel wandered forty years for disobedience, Egypt would endure forty years of emptiness for its pride.<p>&#8226; Historical records show Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s campaign (ca. 568-525 BC) ravaged Egypt, and Persian domination followed. Cities like Memphis and Thebes never regained former glory during that era (<a href="/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/32-15.htm">Ezekiel 32:15</a>). God&#8217;s purpose in the time-bound judgment is revelation of His identity and holiness.<p>&#8226; Nestled &#8220;among the ruined cities,&#8221; Egypt joins the company of other judged nations&#8212;Tyre (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26</a>), Sidon (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>), Edom (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>)&#8212;illustrating that no city, however grand, is exempt from divine accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the countries</b><p>&#8226; Beyond physical ruin, the people themselves would be uprooted.

The scattering fulfilled God&#8217;s word precisely.<p>&#8226; Yet the dispersion is not annihilation. Immediately after this verse God promises, &#8220;After forty years I will gather the Egyptians back&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13</a>). Judgment is severe but measured; restoration follows repentance (<a href="/isaiah/19-22.htm">Isaiah 19:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The scattering reminds us that God directs the movements of nations for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Ezekiel 29:12</a> is a precise, literal prophecy: God would strip Egypt of its famed fertility, leave its cities empty for forty years, and scatter its people across the world. History confirms the devastation under Babylon and Persia, validating Scripture&#8217;s accuracy. The verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereignty, the certainty of His judgments, and His grace that places a limit on punishment with the promise of future restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Scatter the Egyptians among the nations.--</span>Megasthenes and Berosus state that Nebuchadnezzar on his conquest of Egypt, sent great numbers of the people captive to Babylon; others doubtless, as in similar cases, took refuge in Ethiopia, Libya, and other neighbouring lands. The kind of desolation foretold for Egypt is the same as that for "desolate" cities and countries that fell under the power of the conqueror: they were to be plundered and reduced to subjection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations</span>. As before, records are silent as to any such dispersion. All that we can say is that such a deportation was uniformly the sequel of the conquests of an Oriental king, as in the case of the captivities of Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) and Jerusalem, and of the nations that were settled in Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), and of the Persians by Darius; that if we find reason to believe that Egypt was invaded by Nebuchadnezzar after the destruction of Jerusalem, we may assume, with little risk of doubt, that it was followed by what Ezekiel describes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
