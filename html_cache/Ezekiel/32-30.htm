Historically, the Phoenicians were known for their maritime prowess and trade. The "north" often symbolizes regions that were threats to Israel, such as Assyria and Babylon. The inclusion of Sidonians highlights their historical enmity and idolatry, which were condemned by the prophets.<p><b>they went down in disgrace with the slain,</b><br>The imagery of going "down" signifies death and descent into Sheol, the abode of the dead. The disgrace mentioned here reflects the loss of honor and power, a common theme in prophetic literature where the proud are humbled. This aligns with the biblical principle that those who exalt themselves will be brought low.<p><b>despite the terror of their might.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the formidable power and influence these leaders once wielded. Despite their might, they could not escape judgment. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate sovereignty of God over all nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15-17</a>.<p><b>They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword</b><br>Being "uncircumcised" in this context symbolizes being outside the covenant community of Israel, often associated with impurity and judgment. The slain by the sword indicates a violent end, common in divine judgments against nations. This reflects the fate of those who oppose God, as seen in the fate of Goliath and other enemies of Israel.<p><b>and bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit.</b><br>The "Pit" is another term for Sheol, emphasizing the finality and hopelessness of their condition. Bearing shame indicates a loss of dignity and honor, a common theme in prophetic warnings. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that those who reject God will face eternal separation and disgrace, contrasting with the hope of resurrection and eternal life for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes_of_the_north.htm">Princes of the North</a></b><br>Refers to the leaders or rulers from the northern regions, possibly including nations like Assyria or Babylon, known for their military might and influence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sidonians.htm">Sidonians</a></b><br>Inhabitants of Sidon, a prominent city in ancient Phoenicia, known for its wealth and maritime prowess.

The verse affirms that divine justice is literal, universal, and inescapable, urging every generation to humble itself before the Lord while mercy is still offered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">The princes of the north.--</span>The word is not the same as that used for the princes of Edom in <a href="/ezekiel/32-29.htm" title="There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:29</a>. That refers to the heads of the Edomite tribes, but this is thought to imply enfeoffed or vassal princes.
