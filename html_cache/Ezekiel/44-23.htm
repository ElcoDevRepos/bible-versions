The role of teaching was crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people. The priests were to be spiritual leaders, guiding the people in understanding God's laws and commandments. This echoes the role of spiritual leaders today, who are tasked with teaching and guiding believers in the truth of Scripture.<p><b>the difference between the holy and the common</b><br>The distinction between holy and common is a central theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the Levitical laws. "Holy" refers to that which is set apart for God, while "common" pertains to everyday, secular use. This distinction was vital for maintaining the purity of worship and the community's relationship with God. The concept is rooted in the holiness of God Himself, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>, where priests are instructed to differentiate between the holy and the common.<p><b>and show them how to discern between the clean and the unclean.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of ritual purity in the Israelite community. The laws concerning clean and unclean animals, objects, and actions are detailed in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>. These laws were not only about physical cleanliness but also about spiritual purity and obedience to God. The ability to discern between clean and unclean was a sign of spiritual maturity and understanding. This discernment is a type of the spiritual discernment that believers are called to exercise, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>, where mature believers are described as those who have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Specifically, the Levitical priests, who are given the responsibility to instruct the people in matters of holiness and purity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are being instructed on how to live in accordance with His laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_babylonian_exile.htm">The Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time of judgment and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern between what is holy and common, clean and unclean, in their daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders have a responsibility to teach and guide others in understanding God's standards of holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_daily_life.htm">Holiness in Daily Life</a></b><br>Holiness is not just a religious concept but a practical lifestyle that affects every aspect of a believer's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_maturity.htm">The Call to Maturity</a></b><br>As believers grow in their faith, they should develop the ability to discern and make decisions that honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The community of believers should support one another in living out God's standards and holding each other accountable.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_44_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 44:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_holy_vs_common_daily.htm">How can we discern "between the holy and the common" in daily life?
