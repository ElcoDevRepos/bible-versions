In biblical times, embroidered garments were a sign of wealth and status, often used in religious ceremonies. The act of using these garments for idolatry signifies a profound betrayal of the covenant. This imagery is reminiscent of the betrayal seen in <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>, where Israel misuses God's gifts. The garments can also symbolize the righteousness and purity God intended for His people, which they defiled through idolatry.<p><b>and you set My oil and incense before them</b><br>Oil and incense were integral to worship in the temple, representing the presence and favor of God. The use of "My oil and incense" underscores that these were sacred items meant for worshiping Yahweh alone. By setting them before idols, Israel was not only misappropriating what was holy but also attempting to transfer the worship due to God to false gods. This act parallels the warning in <a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a> against offering unauthorized incense. The oil can also be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, and its misuse signifies a rejection of God's Spirit. The incense, often associated with prayer (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>), being offered to idols, indicates a misdirection of devotion and communication meant for God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

What He had graciously provided as a sign of honor and covenant love she later seized for her own purposes.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;embroidered garments&#8221; point to God-given beauty and dignity, similar to the priestly garments He prescribed in <a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2&#8211;3</a> and the worthy garments He promises in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>.<p>&#8226; By appropriating these gifts for sin, Jerusalem mirrored <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;She did not acknowledge that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil&#8230; and she lavished it on Baal.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to cover them</b><p>&#8226; Instead of adorning herself in devotion to the Lord, Jerusalem used the garments &#8220;to cover&#8221; lifeless idols. The very attire that should have distinguished her as set apart now concealed abominations.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a> pictures a similar act: &#8220;You will discard your silver-plated idols&#8230; you will throw them away.&#8221; Here, however, the idols are not discarded but dressed&#8212;an even deeper insult.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a> underscores the folly: &#8220;With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves, to their own destruction.&#8221; The covering of idols is symbolic of embracing and protecting what God hates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you set My oil and incense</b><p>&#8226; The oil and incense belonged exclusively to the Lord&#8217;s worship (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7&#8211;9</a>; 30:25).

Jerusalem took what God lovingly bestowed&#8212;embroidered garments, sacred oil, fragrant incense&#8212;and redirected every gift to decorate and serve idols. Instead of displaying gratitude and holiness, she invested heaven&#8217;s treasures in hellish worship. The verse therefore stands as a sober reminder: every talent, resource, and privilege we possess is &#8220;My&#8221; gift, meant for His glory alone. To divert them elsewhere is not merely misuse; it is spiritual adultery that wounds the heart of the Giver.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine oil and mine incense</span>. This, as afterwards in <a href="/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>, was the crowning aggravation of the guilt. The very gifts of God, designed for his worship, were prostituted to that of his rivals. The "oil" is that of <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>, perfumed and set apart for sacred uses. The act of covering the idol was, as in ver. 8, the symbol of the marriage union. In the sweet savour we have the familiar phrase of <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. The scene brought before us is that of a sacrificial feast, in which cakes of flour, honey, and oil were eaten whilst incense was offered. So we have the "adored liba" of Virgil, 'AEneid,' 7:109, or more fully in Tibullus, 'Eleg.,' 1:7, 53, 54, the "thuria honores," the "liba ... dulcia melle." <span class="cmt_word">Thus it was,</span> etc. As in ver. 16, the description seems to rouse an instinctive abhorrence in the prophet's mind, which finds utterance in this form: "Yes, it was even so." The words are, however, taken by the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther as opening the following verse: "And it came to pass that." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
