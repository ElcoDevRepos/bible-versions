It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the following words are not of human origin but divinely inspired. This establishes the seriousness and certainty of the prophecy.<p><b>I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon:</b><br>This prophecy indicates a divine judgment against Egypt, a nation historically opposed to Israel. Nebuchadnezzar, as the king of Babylon, is portrayed as an instrument of God's judgment. Historically, Babylon was a dominant power in the ancient Near East, and this prophecy aligns with Babylon's expansionist policies. The giving of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar signifies a transfer of power and a humbling of Egypt, which had been a significant power in the region.<p><b>who will carry off its wealth, seize its spoil, and remove its plunder:</b><br>This phrase describes the outcome of Babylon's conquest of Egypt. The terms "wealth," "spoil," and "plunder" indicate the material riches that Egypt possessed, which were to be taken by Babylon. This reflects the common practice of ancient warfare, where victors would take the resources of the defeated. The prophecy highlights the totality of Egypt's defeat and the thoroughness of Babylon's victory.<p><b>This will be the wages for his army:</b><br>Here, the prophecy explains the reason for the conquest: it serves as compensation for Nebuchadnezzar's army. This suggests that the Babylonian forces were to be rewarded for their efforts, possibly due to their previous campaigns, such as the lengthy siege of Tyre. The concept of "wages" implies a transactional nature to the conquest, where the spoils of Egypt serve as payment for military service. This reflects the economic realities of ancient warfare, where soldiers were often compensated through the acquisition of plunder.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Jewish exiles in Babylon.

History verifies the prophecy, reinforcing our confidence that every word of Scripture stands firm and that God remains Lord over all peoples and events.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">I will give.</span>--In the original this is in the form of a participle; literally, <span class= "ital">I am giving.</span> This form is often used of the future, but with especial appropriateness of the immediate future. The other tenses, according to the Hebrew usage, take the temporal meaning of the principal verb. This seems probably to have been spoken at the very time of Nebuchadnezzar's campaign and conquest. On the evidence that he did actually conquer Egypt, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the book. He must have there found abundant booty, as the kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty were commercial, and greatly given to the accumulation of wealth.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS E: ON CHAPTER 29:19.--ON NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S CONQUEST OF EGYPT.</span><p>The fact of this conquest having been called in question, it may be well to state very briefly the points of evidence in its favour. It is admitted by all that Pharaoh-Hophra was dethroned, and died a violent death, and was succeeded by Amasis, who was at first little regarded by the people, though he afterwards won their confidence. The account given of this revolution by the Egyptian priests to Herodotus makes no mention of any foreign interference, but represents it as wholly an internal affair, caused by a revolt of the troops of Hophra, He sent Amasis to them to bring them back to their allegiance, but they saluted him as king. This authority is suspicious, since the priests were prone to cover up whatever they considered against the honour of their country; and the two facts of the popularity of Amasis with the troops and his unpopularity with the people are scarcely consistent, since it is said that he spared Hophra for a time, but afterwards, yielding to the wishes of the people, strangled him. Now against this suspicious and interested story stands the much more probable supposition that Hophra was dethroned and Amasis put into his place by the power of Nebuchadnezzar. Megasthenes and Berosus, according to Josephus, expressly testify that "Nebuchadnezzar conquered a great part of Africa, and having invaded Egypt, took many captives, who were committed to the charge of persons appointed to conduct them after him to Babylon." This conquest, according to the dates already given, must be placed just at the time of the fall of Hophra. Besides this, there is a very full prophecy of the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 46), uttered in the first year of his reign (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/46-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;">Jeremiah 46:1</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/25-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;">Jeremiah 25:1</a>). But Jeremiah was himself afterwards carried into Egypt, and while there uttered other prophecies to the same effect (Jeremiah 43, 44). It is altogether probable that he was still living there at the time of Nebuchadnezzar's expedition; and, on the lowest grounds, it is inconceivable that he should have allowed these various prophecies to remain on record if they had been proved false by the event. The same thing substantially may be said also of the present prophecy of Ezekiel, and of that in <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.">Ezekiel 30:10</a>, although the prophet was not, like Jeremiah, living where he could be an eye-witness of the result of the attack. Other prophecies against Egypt (Isaiah 18, 19, 31; <a href="/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a>) are more general, and may not have in view this particular conquest.<p>Again, Ezekiel represents Egypt as spoiled by Nebuchadnezzar, while both ancient history and the monuments describe the country as rich and prosperous under Amasis. There is really no inconsistency, but entire harmony between these accounts. The great drain upon the resources of Egypt for many generations had been her foreign wars with the powers of Mesopotamia. Relieved of this, and at peace with Nebuchadnezzar, under the government of his vassal, Egypt would soon have recovered her prosperity in wealth and art, while still politically desolated and no longer able to appear as a great power among the nations. From this time through all subsequent history Egypt was a base kingdom, and never again able to dispute, as in former days, the sovereignty of the world. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold I give the land of Egypt</span>, etc. For this disappointment, Ezekiel, writing, so to speak, the postscript which he incorporates with his earlier oracles, promises compensation. Egypt, as he had said seventeen years before, should be conquered, and its cities plundered, and so there should be <span class="cmt_word">wages</span> enough for the whole thirteen years of fruitless labor in the siege of Tyre. In that labor, the prophet adds (Ver. 20), they, though they knew it not, had been working out the will of the Supreme.
