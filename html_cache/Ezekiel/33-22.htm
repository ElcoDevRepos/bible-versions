The "fugitive" refers to a survivor from Jerusalem, bringing news of the city's fall to the Babylonians. This event fulfills earlier prophecies given by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26-27</a>). The timing, "the evening before," highlights God's precise orchestration in revealing His word to Ezekiel. The arrival of the fugitive marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, confirming the judgment that had been prophesied.<p><b>the hand of the LORD was upon me</b><br>This expression indicates a divine encounter or empowerment. Throughout Ezekiel, the "hand of the LORD" signifies God's direct influence or control over the prophet (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3, 3</a>:14, 8:1). It underscores the authority and authenticity of Ezekiel's message, as he is not speaking on his own but under divine inspiration. This phrase also connects to other biblical instances where God's hand signifies power and guidance (<a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>, <a href="/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>).<p><b>and He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning</b><br>Ezekiel had been rendered mute as a sign to the people, only speaking when God gave him a message (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>). The opening of his mouth signifies the end of this period of silence, allowing him to communicate freely once more. This act of God "opening" Ezekiel's mouth symbolizes the restoration of his prophetic voice, aligning with the arrival of the fugitive and the confirmation of Jerusalem's fall.<p><b>So my mouth was opened and I was no longer mute</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the restoration of Ezekiel's ability to speak. It marks a transition in his ministry, from one of warning to one of explanation and hope. The lifting of his muteness signifies a new phase in God's communication with His people, as Ezekiel is now able to deliver messages of both judgment and future restoration. This change also prefigures the ultimate liberation and restoration found in Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), bringing God's message of salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

reminding readers that He rules over events and timing (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting underscores Ezekiel&#8217;s credibility: what he is about to say is confirmed by the incoming eyewitness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the hand of the LORD was upon me</b><p>&#8226; Throughout Ezekiel, this phrase signals divine power seizing the prophet for a specific task (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; 3:14; 37:1).<p>&#8226; It guarantees that Ezekiel&#8217;s forthcoming words are God&#8217;s, not personal opinion (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s experience highlights that effective ministry depends on the Lord&#8217;s enabling hand, never on human strength (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He opened my mouth</b><p>&#8226; Earlier, God had deliberately muted Ezekiel except for occasional judgments (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>; 24:27).<p>&#8226; The silence symbolized Judah&#8217;s stubborn refusal to listen; now the restored speech signals a new chapter of hope.<p>&#8226; Similar moments in Scripture&#8212;such as Zechariah regaining speech after John&#8217;s birth (<a href="/luke/1-64.htm">Luke 1:64</a>)&#8212;show God&#8217;s authority over both message and messenger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the man came to me in the morning</b><p>&#8226; God moves first: Ezekiel speaks before any human confirmation arrives, proving the revelation is supernatural (<a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By morning, when the fugitive finally arrives, the exiles can match the prophet&#8217;s words with the eyewitness report, cementing trust in God&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; The sequence models how believers can rely on Scripture&#8217;s truth even before circumstances verify it (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So my mouth was opened and I was no longer mute</b><p>&#8226; The lifting of the mute condition frees Ezekiel to deliver consoling promises that follow, including the vision of a restored Israel (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; His renewed voice affirms that God disciplines but also restores; judgment never has the last word (<a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers today, the verse encourages readiness to speak whenever God provides both message and moment (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a> records the precise moment God re-empowers a once-silent prophet on the eve of Jerusalem&#8217;s grim news. The Lord&#8217;s hand assures the message, the timing proves His sovereignty, and the opening of Ezekiel&#8217;s mouth signals a shift from judgment to restoration. The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s Word before evidence appears and to speak boldly when He releases them to do so.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Was upon me.</span>--The sentence becomes clearer by translating this in the <span class= "ital">pluperf.: The hand of the Lord had been </span>(<span class= "ital">already</span>)<span class= "ital"> upon me.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the hand of the Lord</span>. When the messenger arrived he found the prophet in a state of ecstasy. This was in the evening. In that prophetic ecstasy his mouth was opened, and the long silence broken, and though he had not heard the message with his outward ears, he had taken, as it were, that message as his text. It was not till his discourse was ended, and the morning came, that he himself heard the terrible tidings from the lips of the messenger. Then a change came over him. He was no more dumb. The long silence was broken. Had the silence lasted, we ask, from <a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> onward? Had the whole intervening period been one of simply symbolic action, and of written but unspoken prophecies? The words at first suggest that conclusion; but it is traveled by the facts; by the commands of <a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10, 23</a>; by the order to "prophesy" in <a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>; by the message to speak unto the elders in <a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>; by the question, "Doth he not speak parables?" of <a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>. I infer, therefore, that, though the silence had been dominant, it had not been unbroken. To some, at least, a message had been spoken. Others may have been allowed to read the written prophecies. The death of the prophet's wife tended, probably, to the continuance of the silence, and it seems a legitimate inference from <a href="/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a> that it had continued from that date onward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the evening</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
