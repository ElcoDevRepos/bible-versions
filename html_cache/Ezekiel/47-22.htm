The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the covenantal promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where God promised the land of Canaan to their descendants. This allocation signifies the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of Israel as a nation in their own land. The idea of inheritance also points to the spiritual inheritance believers receive through faith, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>and for the foreigners who dwell among you and who have children.</b><br>This inclusion of foreigners is significant, as it reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for all nations. In the ancient Near Eastern context, foreigners often had limited rights, but here they are granted an inheritance, indicating a radical inclusivity. This foreshadows the New Testament teaching that the gospel is for all people, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The mention of children emphasizes the permanence of this inclusion, suggesting that the foreigners' descendants are also to be integrated into the community.<p><b>You are to treat them as native-born Israelites;</b><br>This command challenges the Israelites to extend full rights and privileges to the foreigners, treating them as equals. This reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and the call to justice and mercy. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>). The treatment of foreigners as native-born underscores the unity and equality that God desires among His people.<p><b>along with you, they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</b><br>This final phrase reiterates the inclusion of foreigners in the inheritance of the land, symbolizing their full integration into the community of God's people. The allocation among the tribes suggests a shared identity and purpose, pointing to the unity of believers in Christ. This prophetic vision anticipates the eschatological hope of a restored Israel where all nations are gathered together, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation stands before the throne of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel's visions and prophecies often focus on the restoration of Israel and the coming of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who are to be treated as native-born and given an inheritance in the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which is being promised restoration and inclusion of foreigners in its inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The division of the land among the tribes of Israel, which is extended to include foreigners, symbolizing God's inclusive promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The twelve tribes descended from the sons of Jacob, each receiving a portion of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_inclusive_promise.htm">God's Inclusive Promise</a></b><br>God's plan has always included the nations, not just Israel.

The verse upholds God&#8217;s covenant fidelity to Israel while showcasing His age-long purpose to include people from every nation in His blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">By lot.--</span>See Note on <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To the strangers.</span>--An entirely new feature is here added to the Mosaic law. According to <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm" title="But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:34</a>, strangers were to be treated with kindness, but the entire territory was to be divided among the Israelites, and strangers could therefore acquire no land except in so far as they might purchase a temporary right between the years of Jubilee. Now, however, such of them as "shall beget children among you," thus showing a disposition to permanent residence, are to receive an inheritance along with the tribes and in the portion of that tribe where they may have chosen to fix their residence. This privilege is absolute, without any condition of receiving circumcision.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You shall allot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(tap&#183;pi&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124;
