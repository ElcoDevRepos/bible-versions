The people of Israel were captivated by his eloquence and the vivid imagery of his prophecies, much like an audience is drawn to a talented musician. This reflects a common biblical theme where the message of God is heard but not heeded, similar to <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people hear but do not understand. The cultural context of ancient Israel valued oral tradition and storytelling, making Ezekiel's delivery appealing yet not transformative for his audience.<p><b>who skillfully plays an instrument</b><br>The reference to skillful playing suggests that Ezekiel's delivery was not only captivating but also expertly crafted. In the ancient Near East, music and skilled performance were highly regarded, often used in worship and royal courts. This metaphor highlights the irony that despite the prophet's skill, the message's true purpose was lost on the audience. The skillful playing can also be seen as a type of Christ, who spoke with authority and wisdom, yet many did not accept His message (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>They hear your words but do not put them into practice</b><br>This phrase underscores the disconnect between hearing and doing, a recurring theme in Scripture. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a> echoes this sentiment, urging believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers. The historical context of Ezekiel's ministry was during the Babylonian exile, a time when the Israelites were called to repentance and obedience. Despite the clarity and urgency of Ezekiel's message, the people's hearts were hardened, similar to the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13-18.htm">Matthew 13:18-23</a>, where the seed falls on different types of soil, representing various responses to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The people came, sat, and listened, but God saw beneath the surface. They regarded Ezekiel himself&#8212;his personality, his presence&#8212;not the Lord&#8217;s charge behind him (<a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10-11</a>). Like spectators attending a show, they made the prophet the attraction instead of heeding the divine warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a singer of love songs</b><p>Love songs stir emotion yet require no commitment. In the same way, the exiles treated Ezekiel&#8217;s messages as pleasant entertainment. Jesus later likened His generation to children demanding an amusing tune (<a href="/luke/7-32.htm">Luke 7:32</a>). Paul foresaw ears &#8220;itching&#8221; for agreeable teaching (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>). A love song masks its seriousness; the prophetic word unveils eternal stakes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With a beautiful voice</b><p>Ezekiel&#8217;s eloquence was undeniable, and God does not deny the beauty of gifted speech (<a href="/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>). Yet attractive delivery can distract hearers from obeying truth (<a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>). Paul purposely minimized polished rhetoric so that faith would rest on God&#8217;s power, not oratory (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>). Beauty of voice is a blessing only when it leads hearts to surrender.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who skillfully plays an instrument</b><p>Skill adds polish, precision, and artistry&#8212;qualities celebrated throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). However, artistry becomes a snare when it turns worship into mere performance. Herod enjoyed listening to John yet never repented (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>). The exiles applauded Ezekiel&#8217;s skill but kept their lives unchanged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They hear your words</b><p>Attendance was not the problem; attention was. The people &#8220;sit before you as My people and hear your words&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>). Faith does come by hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), yet hearing must penetrate the heart (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). God&#8217;s Word never returns void, but hearers may resist its intent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But do not put them into practice</b><p>Here lies the tragedy. Knowledge without obedience produces delusion (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>). Jesus warned that listeners who ignore His sayings build on sand (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26</a>). Israel&#8217;s history proved that mere acquaintance with truth could not spare them from judgment (<a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a> exposes the peril of treating God&#8217;s Word as inspiring performance rather than marching orders. The verse contrasts attractive delivery with absent obedience. True disciples move from listening to living; they let the beautiful melody of Scripture reshape conduct rather than simply applaud the singer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A very lovely song</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a song of love</span>, an erotic idyll, the word being the same as in Ver. 31. Yet this was the meaning of the large gathering. They came to hear the prophet, as they would to hear a hired singer at a banquet, like those of <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>. The prophet's words passed over them and left no lasting impression. All that they sought was the momentary tickling of the sense. The words receive a special significance from <a href="/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>. The Jewish exiles were famous among their conquerors for the minstrel's art. The nobler singers refused to "sing the songs of Zion in a strange land;" others, it may be, were not so scrupulous. Had the prophet seen his people gather to listen to such a singer? Were they better occupied when they were listening to his message from Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Indeed, you [are]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1444;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
