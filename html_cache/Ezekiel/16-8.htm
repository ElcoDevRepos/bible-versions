It reflects the divine initiative in choosing Israel as His people. The imagery of God "passing by" suggests a moment of divine intervention and care, reminiscent of God's earlier interactions with the patriarchs and His people throughout history.<p><b>and you were indeed old enough for love</b><br>This metaphorical language describes Israel's maturity as a nation, ready for a deeper relationship with God. It implies a readiness for commitment and covenant, similar to a young woman reaching the age of marriage. This maturity can be seen in Israel's development from a group of tribes into a unified nation under leaders like David and Solomon.<p><b>So I spread My cloak over you and covered your nakedness</b><br>The act of spreading a cloak symbolizes protection, provision, and a claim of responsibility, akin to a marriage proposal in ancient Near Eastern culture. This gesture signifies God's willingness to cover Israel's shame and vulnerability, offering His righteousness and protection. It echoes the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz spreads his garment over Ruth as a sign of his intent to marry her (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>).<p><b>I pledged Myself to you</b><br>God's pledge signifies a solemn promise or oath, highlighting the seriousness of His commitment to Israel. This reflects the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where God binds Himself to His people with promises of faithfulness and blessing. It underscores the unbreakable nature of God's love and commitment.<p><b>entered into a covenant with you</b><br>The covenant is a central theme in the Bible, representing a formal agreement between God and His people. This covenant with Israel is rooted in earlier covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and later formalized through Moses at Sinai. It involves mutual obligations, with God promising to be their God and Israel agreeing to follow His laws.<p><b>and you became Mine</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the exclusive relationship between God and Israel. It signifies ownership and belonging, where Israel is set apart as God's treasured possession. This echoes the language of <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God declares Israel to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>The use of "declares the Lord GOD" underscores the authority and certainty of the message. It is a divine affirmation, ensuring that the promises and actions described are not merely human intentions but are decreed by the sovereign Creator. This phrase is a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the reliability of His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, representing His covenant relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Symbolized as a woman whom God has chosen and entered into a covenant with.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and Israel, signifying a deep, committed relationship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/garment.htm">Garment</a></b><br>Represents protection, covering, and the act of taking someone under one's care.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_marriage_imagery.htm">Love and Marriage Imagery</a></b><br>Symbolizes the intimate and committed relationship God desires with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_initiative_in_relationship.htm">God's Initiative in Relationship</a></b><br>God takes the first step in establishing a relationship with His people, demonstrating His love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_as_commitment.htm">Covenant as Commitment</a></b><br>The covenant signifies a binding commitment, much like a marriage, where God pledges Himself to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_and_provision.htm">Protection and Provision</a></b><br>The imagery of spreading a garment signifies God's protection and provision, reminding us of His care and covering over our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/response_to_god's_love.htm">Response to God's Love</a></b><br>Just as Israel was called to respond to God's covenant, we are called to respond to His love and commitment with faithfulness and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>The phrase "old enough for love" suggests spiritual maturity, indicating the readiness to enter into a deeper relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_16_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_16_8_God_s_covenant_symbol.htm">How does Ezekiel 16:8 illustrate God's covenant relationship with His people?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_I_spread_My_cloak_over_you.htm">What does "I spread My cloak over you" signify in a biblical context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Ezekiel_16_8_s_commitment.htm">How can we apply the commitment shown in Ezekiel 16:8 to our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_16_8_parallels_in_Scripture.htm">What parallels exist between Ezekiel 16:8 and God's promises in other Scriptures?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_16_8_God_s_faithfulness_today.htm">How does understanding Ezekiel 16:8 deepen our appreciation for God's faithfulness today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_16_8_on_God_s_covenant_with_Israel.htm">What does Ezekiel 16:8 reveal about God's covenant relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_16_8_imagery_marriage_customs.htm">How does the imagery in Ezekiel 16:8 reflect ancient marriage customs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_marriage_symbolism_in_Ezekiel_16_8.htm">Why does God use marriage symbolism in Ezekiel 16:8 to describe His relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_god_vs._satan.htm">What does the Bible say about God versus Satan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_spreading_a_garment_mean.htm">What does spreading your garment over someone signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_god_synonymous_with_love.htm">Is God synonymous with love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/ready_for_the_wedding_feast.htm">Are you prepared for the wedding feast properly?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 16:8 Mean</div><b>Then I passed by and saw you</b><p>God personally notices His people. He is not distant or indifferent. Earlier in the chapter He had &#8220;seen&#8221; Israel as an abandoned infant (verses 4-6), and now He looks again, fully aware of her situation. His seeing always leads to action (<a href="/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a>; 3:7-8; <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The phrase also reminds us that grace begins with God&#8217;s initiative, not ours (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you were indeed old enough for love</b><p>The nation had reached a point of maturity where a deeper relationship could be formed.

And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.">Ruth 3:9</a>, and on "becamest mine," <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The words point to the time of the love of the espousals of <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, interpreting the parable, when Israel had grown to the maturity of a nation's life, and gave promise, in spite of previous degradation, of capacities that would render it worthy of the love of the Divine Bridegroom. <span class="cmt_word">I spread my skirt over thee.</span> Garments were often used as coverlets, and the act described was therefore, as in <a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>, the received symbol of a completed marriage (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>). The historical fact represented by the symbol here was probably the formal covenant between Jehovah and Israel (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6, 7</a>). It was then that he became her God, and that she became his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I passed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
