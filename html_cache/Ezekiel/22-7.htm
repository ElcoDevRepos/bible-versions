In ancient Israel, family was the cornerstone of society, and respect for parents was foundational. Disrespecting parents was not only a personal failing but a societal one, reflecting a broader moral decay. This contempt can be seen as a rejection of God's ordained authority structure, which is echoed in the New Testament where Paul warns of disobedience to parents as a sign of societal decline (<a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>). The treatment of parents in this manner indicates a breakdown in familial relationships, which were crucial for maintaining social order and religious instruction.<p><b>Within your walls the foreign resident is exploited,</b><br>The exploitation of foreigners contradicts the Mosaic Law, which commanded Israel to treat the foreigner with kindness and justice (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>). Foreign residents, or "sojourners," were often vulnerable due to their lack of familial and social networks. This exploitation reflects a failure to uphold God's justice and mercy, which were central to Israel's covenant identity. The prophets frequently condemned such injustices, emphasizing that true worship of God includes ethical treatment of others (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). This exploitation is a symptom of a society that has turned away from God's commands, leading to social and spiritual corruption.<p><b>the fatherless and the widow are oppressed.</b><br>The oppression of the fatherless and widows is a grave sin in biblical teaching, as these groups were particularly vulnerable and dependent on community support. The Law repeatedly emphasizes care for orphans and widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>), and their mistreatment is a sign of a society's moral failure. <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> reiterates this concern in the New Testament, defining pure religion as caring for orphans and widows. The oppression of these groups in Ezekiel's time indicates a departure from God's covenantal requirements and a lack of compassion, which are central to God's character. This failure to protect the vulnerable is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, often used to call Israel back to faithfulness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation addressed in this passage, specifically the people of Jerusalem, who are being rebuked for their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_mother.htm">Father and Mother</a></b><br>Representing the family unit, which is being disrespected and dishonored by the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who are being oppressed contrary to God's laws of hospitality and justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fatherless_and_widow.htm">Fatherless and Widow</a></b><br>Vulnerable members of society who are being wronged, highlighting the community's failure to uphold justice and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/honor_and_respect_for_parents.htm">Honor and Respect for Parents</a></b><br>The importance of maintaining respect and honor within the family as a reflection of our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_for_the_foreigner.htm">Justice for the Foreigner</a></b><br>God's heart for justice extends to all people, including foreigners, and we are called to reflect His love and fairness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/care_for_the_vulnerable.htm">Care for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>True religion involves caring for those who cannot care for themselves, such as orphans and widows, demonstrating God's compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage highlights the collective responsibility of a community to uphold God's standards of justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Recognizing areas where we fall short and seeking God's forgiveness and guidance to restore right relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_22_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 22:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_22_7_Honor_parents_role.htm">How does Ezekiel 22:7 highlight the importance of honoring parents in society?

Disrespect for parents signals a wider rejection of God-given authority structures (see <a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>).<p>&#8226; When a society dismisses its elders, it forfeits the wisdom God intends to transmit through generations (compare <a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for similar behavior when they nullified parental care through man-made tradition (<a href="/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4-6</a>). Ezekiel exposes the same heart: contempt for parents reveals contempt for the Lord who commands their honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Within your walls the foreign resident is exploited</b><p>&#8226; God clearly said, &#8220;You must not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; also <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Jerusalem&#8217;s &#8220;walls&#8221; should have offered protection, yet they became boundaries for abuse. The city built to display God&#8217;s glory instead mirrored the nations&#8217; cruelty (<a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord defends the outsider (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>); therefore, exploiting immigrants is rebellion against His character and covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fatherless and the widow are oppressed</b><p>&#8226; Scripture consistently pairs orphans and widows as the most vulnerable (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>).

Each offense directly violates God&#8217;s clear commands, showing a people who have abandoned His covenant in both private and public life. The verse stands as a sober reminder that honoring family, welcoming the foreigner, and protecting the helpless are non-negotiable expressions of faithful obedience to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">By father and mother.</span>--Filial respect was one of the most frequently enjoined precepts of the law (see <a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm" title="You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm" title="For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be on him.">Leviticus 20:9</a>, &c.). So the other sins mentioned in this and the following verses are transgressions of special Divine commands. "Dealt by oppression" is "dealt oppressively" (see <a href="/leviticus/19-10.htm" title="And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm" title="You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm" title="You shall not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>, &c.); for "the father less and widow" (<a href="/context/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, &c.).
