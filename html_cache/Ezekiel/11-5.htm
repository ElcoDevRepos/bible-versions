The Spirit's involvement is a recurring theme in Ezekiel's ministry, signifying divine authority and inspiration (<a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2, 3</a>:24). The Spirit's presence is essential for prophetic revelation, emphasizing that the message is not from human origin but from God. This empowerment is similar to other instances in the Old Testament where the Spirit comes upon individuals for specific tasks (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>).<p><b>and told me to declare that this is what the LORD says:</b><br>This phrase underscores the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God. The phrase "this is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, affirming the divine source of the message. It highlights the authority and seriousness of the proclamation, as the prophet speaks not his own words but those of Yahweh. This is consistent with the role of prophets throughout the Bible, who convey God's will to His people (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><b>&#8220;That is what you are thinking, O house of Israel;</b><br>Here, God addresses the inner thoughts of the Israelites, demonstrating His omniscience. The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, often used to denote the nation in its covenant relationship with God. This phrase indicates that God is aware of their rebellious and idolatrous thoughts, which are contrary to His commands. It serves as a reminder of God's intimate knowledge of human hearts (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).<p><b>and I know the thoughts that arise in your minds.</b><br>This statement reinforces God's omniscience and His ability to discern the hidden intentions and plans of His people. It serves as a warning that nothing is concealed from God, and He is fully aware of their plans and motivations. This knowledge of thoughts is a theme found throughout Scripture, where God judges not only actions but also the intentions of the heart (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). It calls the people to accountability and repentance, as God is aware of their true spiritual state.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure through whom God communicates His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord.htm">The Spirit of the LORD</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who empowers and guides Ezekiel to deliver God's message.

Like Samson in <a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a> or Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>, the prophet is empowered to act and speak for God.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;fell&#8221; underscores a sudden initiative from God, not a gradual stirring. Ezekiel does not manufacture this message; he receives it (<a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s work in the Old Testament foreshadows His permanent indwelling of believers promised in <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a> and realized at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told me to declare</b><p>&#8226; Prophetic ministry is never optional.

Every following word is as binding as if spoken audibly from heaven.<p>&#8226; The phrase establishes a contrast: human opinion versus divine revelation.
