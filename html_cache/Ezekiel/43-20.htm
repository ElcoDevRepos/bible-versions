The use of blood in sacrificial rituals underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. This phrase indicates the beginning of a ritual act that is central to the consecration of the altar. Blood from the sacrifice represents the life given to atone for sin, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the atonement of humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and put it on the four horns of the altar</b><br>The altar's horns are symbolic of strength and power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, horns often represented authority and might. By applying blood to the horns, the act signifies the altar's sanctification and the power of the sacrifice to atone for sin. This ritual act is reminiscent of the Day of Atonement practices described in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where blood is used to purify the altar and the people.<p><b>on the four corners of the ledge</b><br>The four corners of the ledge represent the entirety of the altar, suggesting completeness in the act of purification. This comprehensive application of blood signifies that the entire altar is set apart for holy purposes. The number four often symbolizes universality in the Bible, indicating that the atonement is thorough and all-encompassing.<p><b>and all around the rim</b><br>Applying blood all around the rim further emphasizes the thoroughness of the cleansing process. This act ensures that every part of the altar is purified, highlighting the importance of holiness in worship. The rim, being the outermost part, signifies the boundary between the sacred and the profane, reinforcing the need for separation from sin.<p><b>thus you will cleanse the altar</b><br>Cleansing the altar is essential for it to be a suitable place for offerings to God. In the biblical context, cleansing rituals are necessary to remove impurity and make something holy. This cleansing is a precursor to the worship and sacrifices that will take place, ensuring that they are acceptable to God. It reflects the broader biblical theme of purification and sanctification found throughout Scripture.<p><b>and make atonement for it</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the sacrificial system. This phrase highlights the altar's role in the atonement process, serving as the place where sacrifices are made to restore the relationship between God and His people. The concept of atonement is central to Christian theology, ultimately fulfilled in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who made atonement for sin once and for all (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who received visions and messages during the Babylonian exile, tasked with conveying God's instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A central element in the temple, used for sacrifices and offerings to God, symbolizing worship and atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blood.htm">The Blood</a></b><br>Represents the life force and is used for purification and atonement, signifying the seriousness of sin and the need for cleansing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_horns_of_the_altar.htm">The Four Horns of the Altar</a></b><br>Protrusions on the altar's corners, symbolizing strength and the power of God&#8217;s presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process of making amends or reparation for sin, restoring the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_blood_in_atonement.htm">The Significance of Blood in Atonement</a></b><br>Blood is central to the process of atonement, symbolizing life and the seriousness of sin.
