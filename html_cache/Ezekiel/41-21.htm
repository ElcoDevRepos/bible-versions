The rectangular doorframe indicates a structured and orderly design, reflecting God's precision and order in worship. This architectural detail aligns with the specific instructions given for the tabernacle in Exodus, emphasizing the continuity of God's dwelling places. The rectangular shape may symbolize stability and strength, qualities associated with God's presence. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, doorframes often signified transition from the common to the sacred, underscoring the sanctity of the space within.<p><b>and the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar</b><br>The sanctuary here refers to the Holy of Holies, the most sacred part of the temple where God's presence was believed to dwell. The similarity in doorframe design between the outer sanctuary and the Holy of Holies suggests a thematic unity in the temple's construction, highlighting the seamless connection between different areas of worship. This design continuity may also point to the unchanging nature of God. The doorframe's similarity could symbolize the accessibility of God's presence through Jesus Christ, who is described as the "door" in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>, providing a way for believers to enter into a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future idealized temple, symbolizing God's presence and order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The innermost part of the temple, representing the holy presence of God, where the doorposts are described as square.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_symmetry.htm">Divine Order and Symmetry</a></b><br>The square doorposts symbolize God's order and perfection.

<a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; By pointing out this space, the prophet reminds readers that every approach to God has a proper order and progression, mirroring the pattern given to Moses for the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The existence of an outer area also foreshadows the New Testament truth that we &#8220;draw near&#8221; step-by-step through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had a rectangular doorframe</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;a rectangular doorframe&#8230;&#8221;

A squared frame speaks of strength, permanence, and precision&#8212;qualities God values in worship (<a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The clear, defined doorway shows there is only one authorized entrance, anticipating Jesus&#8217; claim, &#8220;I am the door&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar framing appeared in the tabernacle curtain (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36&#8211;37</a>), tying this millennial structure back to every prior dwelling of God among His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar.&#8221;

Matching frames teach that God&#8217;s standards of holiness apply consistently, whether one is entering initial fellowship or the deepest place of communion (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Symmetry also points to perfect completion in the coming kingdom age when this temple will stand (<a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26&#8211;28</a>), and believers will serve as kings and priests with unhindered access (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>;

The remaining clauses ought to read as in the Revised Version, "As for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance <span class="accented">thereof</span> was as the appearance <span class="accented">of the temple</span>," the sanctuary being the holy of holies as distinguished from the holy place or the house as a whole, The precise force of the last words, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">appearance as the appearance</span>, is supposed by Kliefoth and Keil to be that the sanctuary door, like that of the temple, had square pests; by Ewald, that it appeared to be what it really was; by Plumptre, that the appearance was like that he (Ezekiel) had formerly described: by Currey, that the appearance in this vision was the same as in the other visions, and as in the actual temple (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). Something can be said for each of these attempts to elucidate a dark phrase. Smend and Hitzig, follow the LXX. in connecting the last clause of ver. 21 with ver. 22 in this fashion, "And in front of the holy place was an appearance like the sight of a wooden altar." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The outer sanctuary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1964.htm">Strong's 1964: </a> </span><span class="str2">A large public building, palace, temple</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had a rectangular</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1467;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7687;u&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7251.htm">Strong's 7251: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be quadrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">doorframe,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;z&#363;&#183;za&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4201.htm">Strong's 4201: </a> </span><span class="str2">A doorpost, gatepost</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the [doorframe]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the sanctuary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#333;&#183;&#7695;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6944.htm">Strong's 6944: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacred place, thing, sanctity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was similar.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(kam&#183;mar&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4758.htm">Strong's 4758: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sight, appearance, vision</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/41-21.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 41:21 As for the temple the door posts (Ezek.
