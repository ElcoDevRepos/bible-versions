Cherubim are often associated with the presence and holiness of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, where they are depicted as guardians of sacred spaces. The palm trees symbolize victory, peace, and eternal life, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>. The combination of these symbols on the doors of the outer sanctuary suggests a representation of divine protection and blessing. The carvings mirror those on the walls, indicating a consistent theme of holiness and divine presence throughout the temple structure.<p><b>and there was a wooden canopy outside</b><br>The wooden canopy, or vestibule, served as a transitional space between the outer court and the inner sanctuary. This architectural feature highlights the progression from the common to the sacred, emphasizing the sanctity of the inner areas. Wood was a common building material in ancient Near Eastern architecture, often used for its availability and ease of carving. The use of wood here may also symbolize humanity, as wood is a natural, earthly material, contrasting with the divine imagery of the cherubim and palm trees.<p><b>on the front of the portico</b><br>The portico, or porch, was a prominent feature in ancient temple architecture, serving as an entrance to the sacred space. It provided a place for worshippers to gather and prepare themselves before entering the more sacred areas of the temple. The presence of the canopy on the front of the portico underscores the importance of this transitional space, marking the boundary between the secular and the sacred. This architectural detail reflects the temple's role as a place of meeting between God and His people, a theme echoed in other biblical passages such as <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a> and

Mean</div><b>Cherubim</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel notes that &#8220;Cherubim &#8230; were carved&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/41-25.htm">Ezekiel 41:25</a>). Throughout Scripture cherubim are pictured as guardians of God&#8217;s holiness and glory: after Eden&#8217;s fall they block the way back to the tree of life (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), they overshadow the mercy seat in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>), and they fill Solomon&#8217;s temple d&#233;cor (<a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence on the new temple&#8217;s doors underscores that anyone who approaches must come with reverence before the holy God who still enthrones Himself &#8220;between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Palm trees</b><p>&#8226; Alongside the cherubim &#8220;palm trees&#8221; are carved. Palms picture life, victory, and flourishing: God&#8217;s people rejoiced with palm branches at the Feast of Booths (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), the righteous &#8220;flourish like a palm tree&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>), and the redeemed in glory wave palms before the throne (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing palms next to angelic guardians balances awe with hope&#8212;God welcomes worshipers into a place of life and victory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like those on the walls</b><p>&#8226; The same motifs appeared earlier on the inner walls (<a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>). Continuity of design reminds us that holiness and blessing are not confined to one spot; they permeate the entire house.<p>&#8226; Repetition also reinforces teaching&#8212;everywhere the eye turns, the worshiper is schooled in God&#8217;s character of majesty (cherubim) and mercy (palm life).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were carved on the doors of the outer sanctuary</b><p>&#8226; Doors separate common space from sacred space. Carving these symbols directly onto the entrance declares that holiness begins the moment one steps toward God.<p>&#8226; New-covenant fulfillment shines here: Christ says, &#8220;I am the gate; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). Through Him we now &#8220;enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A wooden canopy outside</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel adds, &#8220;there was a wooden canopy outside.&#8221; A canopy shelters and shades. Scripture frequently links God&#8217;s presence with protective covering: &#8220;He made darkness a canopy around Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-12.htm">2 Samuel 22:12</a>) and &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple&#8217;s overhang hints that worshipers find refuge even before they step fully inside&#8212;an echo of the Word who &#8220;became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), spreading His merciful covering over all who draw near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the front of the portico</b><p>&#8226; The portico (porch) is the welcoming threshold. By adorning its face, God visually invites everyone to taste His goodness: &#8220;Better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The forward-facing position signals outward mission. One day the nations will stream to this house (<a href="/isaiah/62-9.htm">Isaiah 62:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>), finding both holiness and hospitality in the God of Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/41-25.htm">Ezekiel 41:25</a> weaves a rich tapestry on the very doors of the future temple: cherubim announce holiness; palms promise life; the repeated patterns teach continuity; the doors proclaim the need for a pure approach; the wooden canopy offers shelter; and the portico&#8217;s front extends a gracious welcome. Together they assure us that God&#8217;s house is both awe-inspiring and inviting, a place where redeemed people may safely enter, worship, and flourish under His faithful, guarding presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Thick planks.--</span>After stating that the doors just described were ornamented like the walls, the prophet speaks of something that was on the outer front of the porch.
