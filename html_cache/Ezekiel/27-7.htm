Egypt was renowned for its high-quality linen, often used in garments for the elite and in religious contexts (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>). The use of such linen for sails indicates the opulence and status of Tyre's maritime ventures. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of Egypt as a symbol of worldly wealth and power (<a href="/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>). The sail, serving as a banner, signifies Tyre's pride and identity, much like how banners were used in ancient times to represent nations or tribes (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>).<p><b>which served as your banner</b><br>The sail serving as a banner suggests a dual purpose: practical for navigation and symbolic for identity. In ancient maritime culture, sails often bore insignias or colors representing the city or nation, akin to modern flags. This imagery underscores Tyre's prominence and self-representation as a leading trade power. Biblically, banners are often associated with identity and divine protection (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>; <a href="/songs/2-4.htm">Song of Solomon 2:4</a>), contrasting Tyre's reliance on material wealth rather than spiritual allegiance.<p><b>Of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah they made your awning</b><br>The colors "blue and purple" were highly prized in the ancient world, often associated with royalty and divinity (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>). These dyes were extracted from the murex shellfish, a labor-intensive process that made them extremely valuable. The "coasts of Elishah" likely refer to regions in the Mediterranean, possibly linked to the descendants of Javan (<a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>), indicating extensive trade networks. The use of such luxurious materials for an awning further emphasizes Tyre's wealth and the city's role as a hub of commerce and culture. This opulence, however, is juxtaposed with prophetic warnings against pride and reliance on material wealth (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2-8</a>), serving as a cautionary tale of the fleeting nature of earthly riches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Egypt was renowned for such fabric (<a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>), and God presents this detail literally to underscore the unmatched wealth and craftsmanship that clothed Tyre&#8217;s merchant fleet.<p>&#8226; A sail is the most visible feature of a ship. By turning it into &#8220;your banner,&#8221; Tyre advertised not only its goods but its pride. Compare the visual prominence of fine linen in <a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>, where the tabernacle entrance curtain is woven &#8220;of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,&#8221; again emphasizing splendor before the watching world.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links fine linen with prestige and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), yet here it exposes human self-exaltation. Tyre&#8217;s banner announced commercial might, but God&#8217;s prophetic word through Ezekiel will shortly reveal how fragile human glory is (<a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah they made your awning</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blue and purple&#8221; dyes were famously costly (<a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). Only the wealthy could afford them, so an awning woven in these colors turned every deck into a floating throne room.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Elishah&#8221; is generally identified with Cyprus or a nearby Aegean region. The Lord highlights the far-flung reach of Tyre&#8217;s trade routes&#8212;no resource was too distant, no expense spared (<a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>).<p>&#8226; An &#8220;awning&#8221; provided shade and comfort for crew and passengers. Instead of simple canvas, Tyre installed regal fabric&#8212;luxury turned toward ease. <a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a> records similar opulence: &#8220;white and violet linen&#8221; hung in a royal garden. In <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a> the rich man &#8220;was clothed in purple and fine linen,&#8221; picturing the same self-indulgence.<p>&#8226; Together with the fine-linen sail, the blue-and-purple canopy paints a complete portrait: Tyre&#8217;s ships were floating billboards of prestige, yet they were sailing toward judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a> literally catalogs the high-end materials adorning Tyre&#8217;s ships&#8212;embroidered Egyptian linen for the sail and rare blue-purple fabric from distant Elishah for the awning. The verse exposes Tyre&#8217;s extravagant pride: every mast and canopy proclaimed wealth, reach, and self-confidence. By spotlighting these details, God sets the stage for the chapter&#8217;s lament: even the finest sails cannot keep a nation afloat when the Lord decrees its downfall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Fine linen with broidered work.--</span>To a modern sailor "fine linen "may seem both an extravagant and an insufficient material for a ship's sails, but the State ships of antiquity were often fitted out in this way, and the sails embroidered in colours in place of a pennon.

The regions here referred to are the coasts of Asia Minor, where an abundant supply of the <span class= "ital">murex </span>(from which came the famous purple dye) was obtained, when the quantity on the Tyrian coast was insufficient for its manufactures. "That which covered thee" is the awning spread over the ship's deck.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the fine linen of Egypt</span>, the Byssus famous in its commerce, see <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>. This, which took the place of the coarse canvas of the common <span class="accented">ships</span>, was made more magnificent by being embroidered with purple or crimson, with gold borders. The ship of Antony and Cleopatra had purple sails, which, as they swelled out with the wind, served as a banner. The ancient ships had no flags or pennons.

It has been identified, on the ground chiefly of similarity of sound, with Ells, Hellas, or AEolia. Laconia has been suggested as being famous for the murex which supplied the purple dye. The Targum gives Italy. Sicily also has been conjectured. The murex is common all over the Mediterranean, but Cythera and Abydos are named as having been specially famous for it. Probably, as in the case of "Chittim," the word was used with considerable latitude. The latter clause of the verse describes the awning over the deck of the queenly ship.
