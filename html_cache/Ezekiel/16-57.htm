In the context of Ezekiel, the prophet often speaks of the hidden sins of Israel and Judah, which God would eventually reveal and judge. The concept of hidden sin being uncovered is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>, where Jesus warns that nothing concealed will remain hidden. The uncovering of wickedness signifies God's judgment and the inevitable exposure of sin.<p><b>Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom</b><br>Edom, descendants of Esau, often had a contentious relationship with Israel. Historically, Edomites were known to have rejoiced over the misfortunes of Israel, as seen in <a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>. The scorn from Edom represents the shame and humiliation that comes from neighboring nations witnessing Israel's downfall. This reflects the broader biblical theme of nations being used as instruments of God's judgment.<p><b>and all those around her,</b><br>This phrase indicates that not only Edom but also other surrounding nations are involved in the scorn. It highlights the widespread nature of Israel's disgrace. The surrounding nations often had complex relationships with Israel, sometimes allies, other times adversaries. This collective scorn underscores the severity of Israel's situation and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings.<p><b>and by the daughters of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, known for their conflicts during the time of the Judges and King David. Their mention here emphasizes the historical enmity and the depth of Israel's humiliation. The Philistines' scorn is particularly poignant given their past defeats by Israel, now reversed as Israel faces judgment.<p><b>&#8212;all those around you who despise you.</b><br>This final phrase encapsulates the complete alienation and derision faced by Israel from all neighboring peoples. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the nations' reactions to Israel's unfaithfulness. The despising by all around them is a fulfillment of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where Israel is warned of becoming an object of scorn among the nations if they forsake the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city represents the people of Israel, who are being addressed in this passage.
