The gateway entrance, being ten cubits wide, indicates a significant and grand entrance, symbolizing accessibility to God's presence. In biblical numerology, the number ten often represents completeness or divine order, as seen in the Ten Commandments. This measurement underscores the perfection and completeness of God's design for worship and communion with Him. The gateway's width also suggests the inclusivity of God's invitation to His people, reminiscent of Jesus' declaration in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>, "I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved."<p><b>and its length was thirteen cubits</b><br>The length of thirteen cubits for the gateway may seem unusual, as thirteen is not a common biblical number associated with positive symbolism. However, it can be seen as a transitional number, bridging the divine order of twelve (often associated with the tribes of Israel and the apostles) and the completeness of fourteen. This measurement could symbolize the transition from the old covenant to the new, where Jesus fulfills the law and the prophets. The specific dimensions also highlight the uniqueness of this visionary temple, distinct from Solomon's Temple or the Second Temple, pointing to a future fulfillment in the Messianic age. The detailed measurements emphasize the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's vision, foreshadowing the ultimate restoration and perfection found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_measuring_rod.htm">The Man with the Measuring Rod</a></b><br>A heavenly figure, possibly an angel, who guides Ezekiel through the vision and measures the temple, symbolizing divine order and precision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple represents God's presence among His people and the restoration of worship.

Each dimension affirms that worship is neither casual nor chaotic but arranged by a Lord who delights in order, completeness, and intimate fellowship with those who enter His gates.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth of the entry</span> (literally, <span class="accented">opening</span>) of the gate, ten cubits. Obviously this measurement was taken from north to south of the gate-entrance (ver. 6), and represented the whole breadth of the doorway and the threshold, or one-fifth of the entire length of the gate-building. The second portion of the verse, <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gate thirteen cubits</span>, is explained by Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, Keil (with whom Plumptre agrees), as signifying the length of the covered way from the east entrance, since it is supposed the whole length of forty cubits (the length of the gate without the porch) would hardly be roofed in; so that assuming a similar covered way of thirteen cubits at the other end of the gate-building, as one came "from the house," there would be an open space, well, or uncovered courtyard, of fourteen cubits in length and six broad, enclosed on all sides by gate-buildings. The roofs extending from the east and west would be supported on the "posts" of the chambers mentioned in ver. 10. Smend, however, infers, from the windows in the posts within the gate (ver. 16), that the whole extent was roofed in, and accordingly can offer no explanation of the clause; Kliefoth and Schroder prefer to regard the thirteen cubits as the height of the gate, although the word translated "length" never elsewhere has this meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he measured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
