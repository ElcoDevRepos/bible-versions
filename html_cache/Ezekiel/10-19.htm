Their lifting of wings signifies readiness for movement and action, symbolizing the mobility of God's presence. In the context of the temple, cherubim are often seen as guardians of sacred spaces (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>).<p><b>and rose up from the ground</b><br>This movement signifies a departure, indicating a shift in the divine presence. The rising from the ground can symbolize God's judgment and the impending departure of His glory from the temple, a significant event in the narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>with the wheels beside them as they went</b><br>The wheels are part of the vision of the divine chariot, representing God's omnipresence and omnipotence.
