The repetition of "ruin" underscores the total devastation that will come upon Jerusalem and its temple. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled with the Babylonian conquest and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Theologically, it reflects God's judgment on the unfaithfulness of His people, a theme consistent throughout the prophetic books. The use of repetition is a common Hebrew literary device to emphasize the severity and inevitability of the judgment.<p><b>And it will not be restored</b><br>This indicates a period of desolation and abandonment. Historically, Jerusalem remained in ruins for many years after the Babylonian exile. Theologically, this suggests a divine pause, where restoration is withheld until a divinely appointed time. This period of waiting is significant in the biblical narrative, as it points to the need for repentance and the hope of future redemption.<p><b>until the arrival of Him to whom it belongs</b><br>This phrase is messianic, pointing to the coming of the rightful ruler. In Christian theology, this is seen as a prophecy of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who is the rightful heir to the throne of David. The phrase "to whom it belongs" suggests ownership and authority, indicating that the restoration of Jerusalem and the establishment of God's kingdom will occur under the leadership of the Messiah.<p><b>to whom I have assigned the right of judgment.&#8217;</b><br>This highlights the divine authority given to the Messiah. In the New Testament, Jesus is often depicted as the judge of the living and the dead (e.g., <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-27</a>). The assignment of judgment to the Messiah underscores His role in executing God's justice and establishing His kingdom.

"That order," Ezekiel says, "shall be no more." Keil, however, takes the second "it" - the "this" of the Revised Version - as meaning the fact of the overthrow. That also was not final; all things were as in a state of flux till the Messianic kingdom hinted at in the next clause should restore the true order. <span class="cmt_word">Until he come whose right it is.</span> The words contain a singularly suggestive allusion to <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where a probable interpretation of the word "Shiloh" is "he to whom it belongs;" or, as the LXX. gives it, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;</span>.
