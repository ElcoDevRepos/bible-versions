The mention of belts here may indicate a sense of preparedness or authority. In biblical times, belts were also associated with warriors and officials, suggesting a position of power or influence. This imagery aligns with the depiction of the Babylonians as a formidable and organized force.<p><b>and flowing turbans on their heads</b><br>Turbans were common headgear in the ancient Near East, often signifying status or rank. The flowing nature of the turbans suggests a sense of grandeur or nobility. In the context of Ezekiel, this description emphasizes the allure and perceived superiority of the Babylonians, which captivated the Israelites. Turbans are also mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in the priestly garments described in Exodus, indicating a connection to authority and religious significance.<p><b>all of them looked like officers of the Babylonians</b><br>The Babylonians were known for their military prowess and structured hierarchy. Officers would have been distinguished by their attire and demeanor, representing the might and discipline of the Babylonian empire. This phrase highlights the Israelites' fascination with foreign powers and their tendency to be swayed by appearances rather than faithfulness to God. The allure of Babylonian officers serves as a metaphor for the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they were drawn away from their covenant with God.<p><b>in Chaldea, the land of their birth</b><br>Chaldea refers to the southern region of Babylon, known for its rich culture and advanced civilization. It was the birthplace of the Chaldeans, who played a significant role in the history of Babylon. This geographical reference underscores the origin and identity of the Babylonians, emphasizing their deep roots and established presence in the region. Historically, the Chaldeans were known for their contributions to astronomy and mathematics, which added to their reputation as a sophisticated and influential people. The mention of their birthplace serves to remind the Israelites of the foreign nature of the influences they were adopting, contrasting with their own heritage and calling as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

In Scripture a belt often signifies preparedness for action&#8212;think of God&#8217;s call, &#8220;Fasten your belts,&#8221; before the Exodus night of deliverance (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>) and Paul&#8217;s picture of the believer standing firm with &#8220;the belt of truth&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>). By portraying these Babylonians with girded waists, Ezekiel underscores how attractive Judah found the enemy&#8217;s polished, soldierly image: power, order, confidence, everything they wrongly envied (compare <a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19&#8211;20</a>, where Israel longed to be &#8220;like all the other nations&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Flowing turbans on their heads</b><p>The &#8220;flowing turbans&#8221; (literally high, elegant headgear) spotlight rank and splendor. Turbans were worn by priests (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>), kings (<a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>), and noble officers (<a href="/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a>). Ezekiel paints a picture of men who carry status, sophistication, and allure&#8212;visual symbols of the culture Judah began to imitate. Earlier the prophet warned, &#8220;Remove the turban and take off the crown&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>), showing how God would strip false glory. Here the people stare at that same glory and crave it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All of them looked like officers</b><p>The phrase stresses authority and command presence. Judah fixated on these &#8220;officers,&#8221; much as young Daniel and his friends later found themselves under the care of Ashpenaz, the Babylonian chief official (<a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>). The seductive pull was not merely physical but political: trust in strong foreign leadership instead of in the Lord. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a> warns against leaning on one&#8217;s own understanding, yet Jerusalem leaned on human power she admired.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of the Babylonians in Chaldea</b><p>Babylon stood as the towering world empire, famed for wealth (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>), military might (<a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>), and idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/50-38.htm">Jeremiah 50:38</a>). &#8220;Chaldea&#8221; evokes both their ancestral homeland and their occult wisdom (<a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>). By specifying &#8220;Babylonians in Chaldea,&#8221; Ezekiel highlights that God&#8217;s people coveted precisely the civilization God had announced He would use as a rod of judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). In other words, Judah loved the very world system that would soon destroy her.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The land of their birth</b><p>This final clause confirms authenticity: these were not foreign mercenaries but true-born Babylonians, steeped in their nation&#8217;s pride and paganism. <a href="/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28&#8211;31</a> records the region&#8217;s origins; <a href="/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a> notes Babylon&#8217;s boast, &#8220;No one sees me.&#8221; Judah&#8217;s infatuation was with the genuine article&#8212;real Babylonians, real idols, real danger&#8212;making her unfaithfulness all the more shocking (<a href="/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a> paints a vivid portrait of Babylonian officers&#8212;belted, turbaned, formidable&#8212;whose outward splendor captivated Judah. Every detail of their attire symbolizes power, prestige, and pagan allure. By lusting after these men, Jerusalem (Oholibah) craved political alliances and cultural imitation instead of covenant faithfulness. The verse exposes the tragic pattern: God&#8217;s people, impressed by worldly might, abandon the Lord and invite the very judgment He warned about.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceeding in dyed attire</span>;
