The imagery of being "shattered" suggests complete destruction and defeat, a common theme in prophetic literature where God judges nations for their pride and idolatry. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, often seen as invincible, but this prophecy underscores the sovereignty of God over all nations, regardless of their might.<p><b>and lie down among the uncircumcised</b><br>In the Old Testament, circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people, Israel. To be "uncircumcised" was to be outside of this covenant, often symbolizing impurity or being unclean. This phrase indicates that Egypt, despite its power and influence, will share the same fate as other nations that do not know God. It reflects the ultimate humiliation for a nation that prided itself on its own gods and strength.<p><b>with those slain by the sword</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the manner of Egypt's downfall&#8212;through violent conquest. The sword is a common biblical symbol for war and divine judgment. Historically, Egypt faced numerous invasions and defeats, notably by the Babylonians and later the Persians. This prophecy aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God uses other nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen in the fall of Assyria and Babylon.<br><br>The entire verse serves as a reminder of the futility of relying on earthly power and the inevitability of divine justice. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where all earthly powers will be subdued.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
