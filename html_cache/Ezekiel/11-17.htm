The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, underscoring the importance of the message. This is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the words are not of human origin but are a direct communication from God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>).<p><b>I will gather you from the peoples:</b><br>This promise of gathering reflects God's intention to restore His people, Israel, from the nations where they have been dispersed. Historically, the Israelites were scattered due to invasions and exiles, notably the Babylonian exile. This gathering is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing hope and restoration (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>).<p><b>and assemble you from the countries to which you have been scattered:</b><br>The scattering of Israel was a consequence of their disobedience and idolatry, as warned in the Mosaic Covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). The promise of assembly indicates a reversal of judgment and a return to covenant blessings. This also foreshadows the eschatological gathering of God's people, a theme that resonates in the New Testament with the gathering of believers in Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p><b>and I will give back to you the land of Israel:</b><br>The land of Israel holds significant theological importance as the Promised Land given to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This promise of restoration to the land signifies not only a physical return but also a spiritual renewal and fulfillment of God's covenant promises. It prefigures the ultimate restoration and inheritance believers have in Christ, who is the fulfillment of all God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were scattered among the nations due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The promised land given to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, symbolizing God's covenant and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive and scattered by foreign powers, primarily Babylon, as a consequence of their sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gathering.htm">The Gathering</a></b><br>A prophetic promise of restoration where God will bring His people back to their homeland, signifying redemption and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's disobedience, God remains faithful to His covenant promises.

Here also the law of" springing and germinant accomplishments" finds its application. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 47:13-48:35) has his ideal of a new geographical Israel, as of a new local temple, a land from which idolatrous shrines and high places have disappeared. St. Paul (<a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>.) clings to the thought of a restoration of the literal Israel, even while he strips it of Ezekiel's geographical limitations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I will gather</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qib&#183;ba&#7779;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
