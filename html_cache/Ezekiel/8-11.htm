These elders were meant to guide and represent the people, indicating a significant level of authority and responsibility. The presence of these elders in this vision suggests a widespread corruption among Israel's leadership, as they are depicted participating in idolatrous practices. This scene reflects the spiritual decline of Israel, where even those who were supposed to lead the people in righteousness were engaged in abominations.<p><b>with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them</b><br>Jaazaniah is identified by his lineage, linking him to Shaphan, a scribe during King Josiah's reign who played a role in the discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-14</a>). This connection highlights the tragic departure from the reforms and revival under Josiah, as his descendants are now involved in idolatry. The mention of Jaazaniah by name emphasizes the personal accountability of those involved and serves as a stark contrast to the faithfulness of his forebears.<p><b>Each had a censer in his hand</b><br>Censers were used in the worship practices of Israel, particularly in the tabernacle and temple, to burn incense as a symbol of prayers ascending to God (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-9</a>). The use of censers by these elders in this context, however, indicates a perversion of true worship. Instead of offering prayers to the God of Israel, they are engaging in idolatrous rituals. This misuse of sacred objects underscores the depth of their apostasy and the blending of pagan practices with the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising</b><br>Incense in biblical worship was meant to be a pleasing aroma to the Lord, symbolizing the prayers and intercessions of the people (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). In this vision, the rising incense represents the false worship and idolatry that had infiltrated the temple, a direct affront to God. The imagery of the fragrant cloud suggests that the elders believed their actions were acceptable, yet it was a stench in the nostrils of the Lord. This scene foreshadows the judgment that would come upon Israel for their unfaithfulness, as prophesied throughout the book of Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventy_elders_of_the_house_of_israel.htm">Seventy Elders of the House of Israel</a></b><br>These were leaders among the Israelites, representing the people.

Inside, he sees the inner leadership of the nation&#8212;seventy elders&#8212;engaged in secret worship.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Seventy&#8221; immediately recalls the original council Moses established at God&#8217;s command (<a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16-17</a>) and the representatives who saw the LORD on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1, 9</a>-10).

Even a descendant of faithful Shaphan is among them, showing how swiftly compromise spreads.

The seventy elders were not the sanhedrin, which was not constituted until after the return from Babylon; but the number has probable reference to the seventy chosen to enjoy with Moses the Theophany of <a href="/context/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9-10</a>, and the other seventy selected to share with him in the gifts of the Spirit (<a href="/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a>).

It is hardly probable that two persons of the same character and the same (not very common) name should have been among the leaders of the people at the same time. The mention of his grandfather here would be appropriate, as bringing out the contrast in their characters, and showing the change for the worse that had been going on among the people. Shaphan was an officer of the court of King Josiah, and active in the reformation instituted by him (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>); while his son (Elasah) was one of the messengers by whom Jeremiah sent his prophecies to the Captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>); and another son, Gemariah, was a scribe, having a chamber "in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord's house," in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>). At the same time his grandson, Michaiah, was sufficiently prominent at court to join in the intercession of the princes against the destruction of Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/36-11.htm" title="When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,">Jeremiah 36:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>); and a little later, in the general captivity of the ninth year of Zedekiah, another grandson, Gedaliah, had the person of Jeremiah given into his charge (<a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm" title="Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.">Jeremiah 39:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm" title="Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seems convenient to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.">Jeremiah 40:5</a>), and was made governor over the remnant of the people (<a href="/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). Such being the family connections of Jaazaniah, the corruption which could make him a leader of idolatry is strongly shown. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy men</span>, etc. The number was probably chosen with reference to the "elders" who had seen the Divine glory in <a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9, 10</a>. The Sanhedrin, or council of seventy, did not exist till after the Captivity. The number can scarcely have been accidental, and may imply that the elders were formally representative. Another Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, appears in <a href="/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>; yet another, the son of Azur, in <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>. If the Shaphan mentioned is the scribe, the son of Azaliah, under Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), the father of Ahikam (<a href="/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), of Elasah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>), and of Gemariah (<a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10, 11, 12</a>), and the grandfather of Gedaliah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), all of whom were prominent in the reform movement under Josiah, or as friends of Jeremiah, and no other Shaphan appears in history, the fact that one of his sons is the leader of the idolatrous company must have had for Ezekiel a specially painful significance. He could scarcely have forgotten the meaning of his name, "The Lord is listening," and probably refers to it in ver. 12. As the climax of this chamber of horrors, the seventy elders were all acting as priests, and were offering to their pictured idols the incense which none but the sons of Aaron had a right to use, and which they offered to Jehovah only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Before them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
