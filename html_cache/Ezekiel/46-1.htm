It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but from God Himself. This establishes the seriousness and sacredness of the command.<p><b>The gate of the inner court that faces east:</b><br>The east-facing gate holds significant symbolic meaning in biblical texts. The east is often associated with the presence and glory of God, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-5</a>, where the glory of the Lord enters the temple from the east. This gate's orientation also connects to the Garden of Eden, which had an entrance from the east (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), symbolizing a return to divine fellowship.<p><b>must be kept shut during the six days of work:</b><br>The six days of work refer to the regular workweek, reflecting the creation pattern in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God worked for six days and rested on the seventh. The closed gate during these days signifies a separation between the sacred and the secular, emphasizing the holiness of the temple and the need for reverence in approaching God.<p><b>but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened:</b><br>The Sabbath and New Moon were significant times of worship and rest in Israelite culture. The Sabbath, instituted in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a> and commanded in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, is a day of rest and spiritual renewal. The New Moon, as mentioned in <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>, was a time for special sacrifices and worship. Opening the gate on these days symbolizes access to God's presence and blessings, highlighting the importance of regular, dedicated times for worship and communion with God.
