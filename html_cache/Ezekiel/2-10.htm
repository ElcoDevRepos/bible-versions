The act of unrolling signifies the revelation of divine messages. Scrolls were typically made of papyrus or parchment and were used for important documents. The unrolling indicates that the message is ready to be revealed and understood. This action parallels the opening of the scrolls in <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5:1-5</a>, where only the Lamb is worthy to open the scroll, symbolizing the unveiling of God's plan.<p><b>And written on the front and back of it</b><br>The scroll being written on both sides is significant, as scrolls were usually written on one side only. This indicates the completeness and fullness of the message, leaving no space for additions. It suggests the totality of God's judgment and the comprehensive nature of the message Ezekiel is to deliver. This dual-sided writing can be compared to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which were also inscribed on both sides (<a href="/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>), emphasizing the thoroughness of God's law and decrees.<p><b>were words of lamentation, mourning, and woe.</b><br>The content of the scroll is filled with messages of lamentation, mourning, and woe, indicating the severe judgment that is to come upon Israel due to their rebellion and sin. These terms reflect the emotional and spiritual state of the people as they face the consequences of their actions. Lamentation and mourning are often associated with funerals and expressions of deep sorrow, while woe signifies impending doom or disaster. This triad of terms underscores the gravity of the situation and the seriousness of God's message. Similar themes are found in the prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Lamentations, where the prophets express grief over the nation's sin and the resulting judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the scroll, communicating His message through Ezekiel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scroll.htm">Scroll</a></b><br>A symbolic object representing God's message of judgment and lamentation to the people of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a period of great suffering and reflection for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, experiencing the consequences of their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_god's_message.htm">The Weight of God's Message</a></b><br>The scroll written on both sides signifies the completeness and seriousness of God's message.

What he saw was "lamentations, and mourning, and woe;" in other words, this was the whole character of the message he was commissioned to bear until the great judgment in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple should be fulfilled, when, after Ezekiel 33, his prophecies assume a consolatory character.
