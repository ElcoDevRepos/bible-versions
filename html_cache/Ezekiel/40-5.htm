Walls in ancient times were crucial for defense and demarcation. In Ezekiel's vision, this wall symbolizes God's holiness and the separation of the sacred from the profane. The temple area represents God's dwelling place among His people, echoing the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. This imagery connects to <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described with a great, high wall, symbolizing divine protection and sanctity.<p><b>Now the length of the measuring rod in the man&#8217;s hand was six long cubits (each measuring a cubit and a handbreadth),</b><br>The measuring rod indicates precision and divine order. A cubit, an ancient unit of length, was typically the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, approximately 18 inches. A handbreadth adds about 3 inches, making a long cubit roughly 21 inches. The use of a specific measurement underscores the importance of exactness in God's plans. This precision reflects God's meticulous nature in creation and His covenant, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>.<p><b>and he measured the wall to be one rod thick and one rod high.</b><br>The measurement of the wall as one rod thick and one rod high emphasizes the strength and sufficiency of God's protection. The rod, being a standard unit of measure, signifies completeness and stability. This measurement can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and mediator between God and humanity. The wall's dimensions also suggest the impenetrable nature of God's kingdom, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>, where the mountains surround Jerusalem, symbolizing God's enduring protection for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was among the exiles in Babylon.

It is difficult or impossible to fix with precision the length of the cubit of Scripture, more especially as the value of the measure appears to have changed in the course of ages. In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-3.htm" title="Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was three score cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.">2Chronicles 3:3</a> the measurements of Solomon's Temple are given "by cubits after the first [or ancient] measure." It appears, therefore, that the cubit in common use at the time of the compilation of that book (after the return from the captivity) was different from the standard Mosaic cubit. Ezekiel evidently intends to use the latter in his Temple measurements, and therefore adds "an hand breadth" to the common cubit. Different writers vary in their estimate of the length of the measure thus obtained from eighteen to twenty-four inches. By considering it twenty inches we shall have a convenient number for use, and cannot be far wrong. The "reed of six cubits" was therefore about ten feet long.<p><span class= "bld">The breadth of the building--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., the thickness of the wall surrounding the court.</span> The length of this wall is not given until <a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm" title="So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.">Ezekiel 40:47</a>. The thickness and height are made equal, evidently for the sake of the symmetry of the measures.
