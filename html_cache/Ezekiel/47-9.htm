The river symbolizes the life-giving presence of God, flowing from His sanctuary. In biblical context, water often represents life and purification (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). The river's flow signifies the spread of God's blessings and the transformative power of His Spirit. Geographically, this imagery contrasts with the arid climate of the region, highlighting the miraculous nature of this life-giving water.<p><b>There will be swarms of living creatures</b><br>The abundance of living creatures indicates the river's life-giving properties. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this suggests a restoration of creation, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-21</a>). Theologically, it points to the renewal and restoration that comes from God's presence. This abundance can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual revival and the flourishing of God's people.<p><b>And a great number of fish</b><br>Fish are often symbolic of prosperity and provision. In the New Testament, fish are associated with the ministry of Jesus and the calling of His disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The great number of fish in Ezekiel's vision suggests an overflowing of God's blessings and the spread of His kingdom. Historically, fishing was a significant industry in the region, making this imagery relatable to Ezekiel's audience.<p><b>Because it flows there and makes the waters fresh</b><br>The transformation of saltwater to fresh water signifies purification and renewal. This miraculous change represents the cleansing power of God's presence. In a broader biblical context, it echoes themes of redemption and new life found in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The fresh waters symbolize the removal of sin and the restoration of purity.<p><b>So wherever the river flows, everything will flourish</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the transformative impact of God's presence. The flourishing of life wherever the river flows is a metaphor for spiritual growth and vitality. It reflects the promise of abundant life found in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Theologically, it points to the ultimate restoration of creation and the fulfillment of God's kingdom, where all things are made new (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who received visions from God, including the vision of the river flowing from the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_river.htm">The River</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's life-giving presence and the transformative power of His Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures_and_fish.htm">Living Creatures and Fish</a></b><br>Represent the abundance and diversity of life that results from God's blessing and presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt_water.htm">Salt Water</a></b><br>Symbolizes barrenness and death, which is transformed into fresh, life-giving water by the river.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The source of the river, representing God's dwelling place and the origin of spiritual life and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_life.htm">The Source of Life</a></b><br>Just as the river flows from the temple, true life and renewal come from God alone.

This peculiar form has occasioned some perplexity, especially because in the vision of Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>) the waters are represented as divided, half of them flowing to the Dead Sea and half of them to the Mediterranean. It is plain, however, that but one river is intended here, flowing into the Dead Sea. Possibly there is an allusion in the dual form to the Jordan flowing with it into the sea; but this vision throughout pays so little regard to the natural features of the country that it seems more likely that the dual form is simply used to express the greatness of the river, "a double river." By a division of the word and a slight change in the vowels the expression would become "river of the sea," that is, flowing into the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Shall live.</span>--This is to be understood as a pregnant expression; all kinds of life shall spring into being whithersoever the waters come. The same thing is emphatically repeated at the close of the verse, and in the intermediate clause the same thought is expressed by the "very great multitude of fish."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The nature of the healing is next described as an impartation of such celebrity to the waters that <span class="cmt_word">everything that liveth, which moveth</span> - better, <span class="accented">every</span> <span class="accented">living creature which swarmeth</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">whitherseover the rivers</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the two rivers</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall come, shall live</span>. The meaning cannot be that everything which liveth and swarmeth in the sea whither the rivers come shall live, because the Dead Sea contains no fish (see above), but whithersoever the rivers come, there living and swarming creatures of every kind shall spring into existence, shall come to life and flourish. The dual form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, has been accounted for by Maurer, as having been selected on account of its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>; by H&auml;vernick and Currey, as pointing to the junction of another river, the Kedron (H&auml;vernick), the Jordan (Currey), with the temple-stream before the latter, should fall into the sea; by Kliefoth, as alluding to a division of the river waters after entering the sea; by Neumann and Schroder, as referring to the waters of the sea and the waters of the river, which should henceforth be united; and by Hengstenberg, with whom Keil and Plumptre agree, as a dual of intensification (as in Jeremiah 1:21), signifying "double river," with allusion to its greatness, or the strength of its current. None of these interpretations is free from objection; though probably, in default of better, the last is best. Ewald changes the dual into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, a singular with a suffix, while Hitzig makes of it a plural; but neither of these devices is satisfactory. As a further evidence that the waters of the sea should be healed by the inflowing into them of the waters of the river, it is stated that the sea should thereafter contain <span class="cmt_word">a very great multitude of fish</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and the fish will be very many</span>), of which previously it contained none. The next clauses supply the reason of this abundance of fish, <span class="cmt_word">because these waters</span> (of the river) <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> - or, <span class="accented">are</span> (Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">come thither</span> - (into the waters of the sea), <span class="cmt_word">for</span> (literally, and) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they</span>, the latter, <span class="cmt_word">shall be</span> (or, <span class="accented">are</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>healed, and everything shall live</span> (or, connecting this with the foregoing clause, <span class="accented">and everything shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">and live</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whithersoever the river cometh</span> - the river, namely, that proceedeth from the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wherever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the river</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - md<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5158.htm">Strong's 5158: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stream, a winter torrent, a, valley, a shaft</span><br /><br /><span class="word">flows,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
