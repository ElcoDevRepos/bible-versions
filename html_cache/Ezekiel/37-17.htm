The two sticks represent the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Historically, after the reign of Solomon, the united kingdom of Israel split into two: the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). This division led to separate political, religious, and cultural developments. The act of joining the sticks symbolizes God's promise to reunite these divided nations. This reunification is not just political but also spiritual, indicating a future restoration under God's sovereign plan. The imagery of the stick is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where rods or staffs often symbolized authority and leadership.<p><b>so that they become one in your hand</b><br>The unification of the sticks in Ezekiel's hand signifies the divine power and authority behind this prophetic act. It emphasizes that the reunification of Israel and Judah is not by human effort but by God's intervention. This act foreshadows the ultimate unity found in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, who breaks down the dividing wall of hostility (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and unites all believers into one body. The imagery of "one in your hand" also points to the sovereignty of God, who holds the future of His people in His hands, ensuring their restoration and unity. This prophetic act is a precursor to the eschatological hope of a united people of God, gathered from all nations, under the reign of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The two divided kingdoms of the Israelites.
