The siege refers to the Babylonian attack on Jerusalem, which culminated in the destruction of the city and the temple in 586 BC. Ezekiel, living in exile in Babylon, is instructed to symbolically enact the siege, emphasizing the certainty of God's judgment. This act serves as a visual prophecy to the exiles, reinforcing the message of impending doom due to the people's unfaithfulness. Jerusalem's significance as the spiritual heart of Israel makes this prophecy particularly poignant, as it underscores the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>with your arm bared</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, baring the arm was a gesture associated with readiness for action or battle. It symbolizes strength, determination, and the unveiling of God's power and judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God's "outstretched arm" signifies His mighty acts (e.g., <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). Here, Ezekiel's bared arm represents the divine authority and power behind the prophecy, indicating that the coming siege is not merely a political event but a divinely orchestrated act of judgment.<p><b>and prophesy against it</b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to deliver a message of judgment against Jerusalem. Prophecy in the biblical context often involves both foretelling future events and forth-telling, or declaring God's truth. This prophetic act is not just a prediction but a divine indictment against the city for its sins, including idolatry and injustice. The role of a prophet is to be God's spokesperson, and Ezekiel's message aligns with the broader biblical narrative of calling God's people to repentance. This prophecy also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of prophet, priest, and king, bringing both warning and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

(See <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/20-5.htm" title="Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit prostitution with Molech, from among their people.">Leviticus 20:5-6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm" title="And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.">2Chronicles 20:3</a>, marg., &c.) It is a particularly favourite phrase with Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm" title="And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.">Ezekiel 15:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-46.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;">Ezekiel 20:46</a>, &c.). Here this steadfastness of purpose was to be exercised "toward the siege of Jerusalem;" there would be no relenting in this matter--God's purpose of judgment should surely be fulfilled. Further symbolism to the same effect is added, "Thine arm shall be uncovered," withdrawn from the loose sleeve of the Oriental robe, and made ready for battle. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm" title="The LORD has made bore his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.">Isaiah 52:10</a>.) Withal he is to "prophesy against it," doubtless by words suited to his actions. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine arm shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">uncovered.</span> This, as in <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, was the symbol of energetic action. The prophet was to be, as it were, no apathetic spectator of the siege which he was thus dramatizing, but is as the representative of the Divine commission to control and guide it. The picture of the prophet's attitude, not merely resting on his side and folding his hands, as a man at ease might do, but looking intently, with bare outstretched arm, at the scene portrayed by him, must, we may well imagine, have added to the startling effect of the whole procedure. We note the phrase, "set thy face," as specially characteristic of Ezekiel (here, and, though the Hebrew verb is not the same, <a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a>). The words "prophesy against it" may imply some spoken utterance of the nature of a "woe," like that of the son of Ananus (see above), but hardly, I think, a prolonged address. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must turn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your face</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124;
