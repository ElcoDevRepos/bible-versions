Judah's territory was historically significant as it included Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and the Davidic monarchy. The east-to-west orientation reflects the traditional layout of the land divisions in Israel, aligning with the natural topography and historical tribal boundaries.<p><b>will be the portion you are to set apart.</b><br>This portion is designated as holy, set apart for a specific purpose. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this refers to the land reserved for the sanctuary and the priests. The concept of setting apart is deeply rooted in the biblical idea of holiness, where certain people, places, and things are consecrated for God's use, reflecting the holiness of God Himself.<p><b>It will be 25,000 cubits wide,</b><br>The measurement of 25,000 cubits (approximately 7.5 miles or 12 kilometers) indicates a substantial area, underscoring the importance of this portion. The use of precise measurements reflects the order and intentionality in God's plans, reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple. This precision highlights the sacredness and significance of the land.<p><b>and the length of a tribal portion from east to west.</b><br>The length corresponds to the standard size of a tribal allotment, ensuring that this holy portion is integrated into the broader land distribution among the tribes of Israel. This reflects the unity and equality among the tribes, as each receives a fair share of the land, symbolizing God's provision and justice.<p><b>In the center will be the sanctuary.</b><br>The central location of the sanctuary signifies its importance as the focal point of worship and God's presence among His people. This mirrors the centrality of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the Temple in Jerusalem.
