In the context of Ezekiel, Jerusalem is being held accountable for its actions. The concept of bearing disgrace is consistent with the biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Disgrace here is a public acknowledgment of wrongdoing, reflecting the shame that comes from turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>since you have brought justification for your sisters</b><br>Jerusalem's actions have inadvertently justified the behavior of Samaria and Sodom, its "sisters" in this allegory. Historically, Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and Sodom is a symbol of extreme wickedness (Genesis 19). By comparison, Jerusalem's sins were so egregious that they made these other cities appear less sinful. This reflects the biblical principle that greater knowledge and privilege bring greater responsibility (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><b>For they appear more righteous than you</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of Jerusalem's sins. In a cultural context, righteousness was often measured by adherence to the covenant with God. The comparison to Samaria and Sodom, known for their own transgressions, underscores the depth of Jerusalem's moral and spiritual failure. This is a stark reminder of the dangers of complacency and the need for continual repentance.<p><b>because your sins were more vile than theirs</b><br>The term "vile" suggests a deep moral corruption. Historically, Jerusalem had the temple and the law, which should have led to greater faithfulness. Instead, their sins, including idolatry and social injustice, were seen as more grievous. This echoes the prophetic warnings found throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is called to account for its covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>So you too must bear your shame and disgrace</b><br>Repetition of the need to bear shame emphasizes the certainty of judgment. In biblical terms, shame is often associated with exposure and the loss of honor. This reflects the prophetic tradition where Israel's sins are laid bare before God and the nations (<a href="/jeremiah/13-26.htm">Jeremiah 13:26</a>). The call to bear shame is also a call to repentance and restoration.<p><b>since you have made your sisters appear righteous</b><br>This concluding phrase reiterates the irony of Jerusalem's situation. By their actions, they have inadvertently elevated the status of those they considered less righteous. This serves as a warning against self-righteousness and the dangers of comparing oneself to others rather than to God's standards. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), pointing to the need for a savior in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Because Israel&#8217;s sins are committed against greater light and privilege, she must bear disgrace, serving both as judgment and as a divine wake-up call. The verse warns every generation: privilege without obedience multiplies guilt, and when God&#8217;s people dishonor His name, even notorious sinners can seem upright beside them. Repentance, therefore, is the only path from disgrace to restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Hast judged thy sisters.</span>--Judah had approved the judgments upon Sodom and Samaria, as it is always easy for man to approve judgments upon the sins of others; but now this must be brought home to herself for her own greater sins. (Comp. Romans 2)<p>Having described the sin and the punishment, the prophet now goes on in the remainder of the chapter to speak of the restoration of Israel. This is first declared in the strongest terms to be impossible (<a href="/context/ezekiel/16-53.htm" title="When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the middle of them:">Ezekiel 16:53-59</a>), and the efforts of many commentators to transform the language into a covert promise of restoration are entirely unsuccessful. After this, indeed, in <a href="/context/ezekiel/16-60.htm" title="Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.">Ezekiel 16:60-63</a>, the establishment of the Divine covenant with Israel is fully and distinctly promised. Yet there is no contradiction between the two, for the prophet had a right to suppose that the people would remember what had been so plainly declared before: that while the nation as a whole must perish, yet after the purifying chastisements of the Lord He would have mercy upon and bless a remnant who should be saved. The general doom is first announced as irrevocable; then the exception is made for the few.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;
