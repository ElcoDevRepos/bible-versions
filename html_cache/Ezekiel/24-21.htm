The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people. The phrase "the Lord GOD" underscores the divine authority behind the message, indicating that it is not merely a human opinion but a divine decree. This is a common prophetic introduction, seen throughout the Old Testament, where prophets convey God's words to His people.<p><b>I am about to desecrate My sanctuary:</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was central to Israel's religious life. The desecration of the Temple signifies a profound judgment, as it was considered the dwelling place of God among His people. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Babylonians destroyed the Temple in 586 BC. Theologically, this act represents God's judgment on Israel for their idolatry and unfaithfulness, as the Temple had become a symbol of misplaced trust and pride.<p><b>the pride of your power:</b><br>The Temple was not only a religious center but also a symbol of national pride and strength for Israel. It represented their unique relationship with God and their status among the nations. The phrase highlights how Israel had come to rely on the Temple as a source of power, rather than on God Himself. This echoes other biblical themes where God warns against placing trust in physical structures or human achievements (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p><b>the desire of your eyes:</b><br>This phrase suggests the deep emotional and spiritual attachment the Israelites had to the Temple. It was a place of beauty and splendor, capturing the hearts and imaginations of the people. The loss of the Temple would be a devastating blow, akin to losing something cherished and beloved. This reflects the broader biblical theme of idolatry, where the people valued the Temple more than their relationship with God.<p><b>and the delight of your soul:</b><br>The Temple was central to the spiritual life of Israel, a place where they experienced God's presence and favor. Its destruction would not only be a physical loss but a spiritual and emotional one as well. This phrase underscores the depth of the impending judgment, affecting the very core of Israel's identity and worship.<p><b>And the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword:</b><br>This part of the prophecy speaks to the coming devastation and loss of life that would accompany the Babylonian conquest. The mention of "sons and daughters" highlights the personal and familial impact of the judgment, as future generations would suffer the consequences of the nation's sins. This reflects the biblical principle of corporate responsibility and the far-reaching effects of disobedience to God. The imagery of falling by the sword is a common biblical motif for divine judgment and warfare (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

When that temple should be profaned, when sons and daughters should fall by the sword, then they would do as the prophet had done. They would learn that there is a sorrow which is too deep for tears, something that passeth show. The state which the prophet describes is not one of callousness, or impenitence, or despair.
