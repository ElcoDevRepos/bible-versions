The land is set apart for the prince, distinct from the portions given to the tribes of Israel. This allocation ensures that the prince has a defined inheritance, preventing the abuse of power and the confiscation of land from the people, which was a common issue in ancient Israel (<a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21:1-16</a>). The land's designation as a possession in Israel emphasizes the restoration of order and justice in the land, aligning with the covenant promises made to the patriarchs regarding the land of Israel (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>And My princes will no longer oppress My people,</b><br>This statement addresses the historical context of Israel's leaders who often exploited their positions for personal gain, leading to the oppression of the people (<a href="/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>). The promise that princes will no longer oppress the people signifies a future time of righteous leadership, reflecting the messianic hope of a just ruler. This aligns with prophecies of a future Davidic king who will rule with justice and righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>). The cessation of oppression is a key aspect of the eschatological hope for Israel, where leaders will act in accordance with God's laws and principles.<p><b>but will give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.</b><br>This phrase highlights the equitable distribution of land among the tribes of Israel, restoring the tribal inheritances as originally intended in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13-29</a>). The division of land according to tribes underscores the importance of maintaining the tribal identities and inheritances, which were central to Israel's covenant relationship with God. This distribution reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs and the restoration of Israel as a nation under God's rule. It also points to a future time when God's people will live in harmony and justice, each tribe receiving its rightful inheritance, symbolizing the ultimate restoration and unity of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel's messages often focused on judgment and restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes_of_israel.htm">Princes of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the leaders or rulers of Israel, who are being admonished to cease their oppressive practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Represents the collective tribes of Israel, God's chosen people, who are to receive their rightful inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_israel.htm">Land of Israel</a></b><br>The physical territory promised to the tribes of Israel, symbolizing God's covenant and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The unjust treatment or control by the princes, which God commands to cease.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_fairness.htm">God's Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>God desires justice and fairness in leadership.

The verse encourages present-day believers to pray for and model leadership that safeguards rather than exploits (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but will give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;The rest of the land&#8221; refers to everything outside the sacred district and the prince&#8217;s allotment. God orders it to be &#8220;given&#8230;according to their tribes,&#8221; recalling Joshua&#8217;s original distribution (<a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13-23</a> details the forthcoming boundaries, even including sojourners who settle among the tribes, highlighting God&#8217;s inclusive mercy.<p>&#8211; The equitable division reverses past abuses where powerful families swallowed up property (<a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>).<p>&#8211; Key principles:<p>&#8226; Land ultimately belongs to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>); His people are stewards, not owners.<p>&#8226; Tribal identities, though long scattered, will be honored&#8212;evidence that God remembers every promise (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Fair distribution anticipates the Jubilee ideal of restored inheritance (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), hinting at the full redemption creation will enjoy (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a> paints a tangible picture of the coming kingdom: the prince receives a defined inheritance; oppressive leadership ends; and Israel&#8217;s tribes receive their God-ordained portions. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s covenant land, just governance, and faithful care of His people will all converge in a future era where righteousness is the norm and every promise is kept.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/45.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">My princes shall no more oppress.--</span>The use of the plural does not imply that more than one prince should reign at a time, nor is it intended to include the family of the prince; but as everything in the future is described in terms of the past, so the royal authority is conceived of as vested in a succession of rulers, although we have been already told that there shall be but one king over them for ever (<a href="/context/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24-25</a>). The declaration that the "princes shall no more oppress my people" follows naturally on the assignment of this portion. Former kings of Israel had no domain given them, and this had tempted them to acquire private property by violence and extortion. The people had been forewarned of this (<a href="/1_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.">1Samuel 8:14</a>), had often experienced it in their history, and had heard the rebukes of their prophets on account of it (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My princes shall no more oppress my people</span>. That Israel in former times had suffered from the oppressions and exactions of her kings, from Solomon downwards, as Samuel had predicted she would (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>), was matter of history (see <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4, 10, 11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>), and was perhaps partly explained, though not justified, by the fact that the kings had no crown lands assigned them for their support. This excuse, however, for regal tyranny should in future cease, as a sufficient portion of land should be allocated to the prince and his successors, who accordingly should <span class="cmt_word">give</span>, or <span class="accented">leave</span>, the rest of the <span class="cmt_word">land to the house of Israel according to their tribes</span>. The use of "princes" does not show, as Hengstenberg asserts, that "under the ideal unity of the prince in Ezekiel, a numerical plurality is included," and that "these who understand by the prince merely the Messiah must here do violence to the text;" but simply, as Kliefoth explains, that Ezekiel was thinking of Israel's past kings, and contrasting with them the rulers Israel might have in the future, without affirming that these should be many or one (see on Ezekiel 44:3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
