The Sabbath was given to Israel as a covenant sign (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>), distinguishing them from other nations. It served as a reminder of God's creation and His deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). The Sabbath was not merely a day of rest but a symbol of the relationship between God and His people, emphasizing His authority and provision.<p><b>as a sign between us</b><br>In biblical terms, a "sign" is a visible or tangible reminder of a covenant. The Sabbath was a perpetual sign of the covenant between God and Israel, much like circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>). It was meant to be a constant reminder of their unique relationship with God, setting them apart as His chosen people. This sign was intended to foster a sense of identity and belonging, reinforcing their commitment to God's laws and statutes.<p><b>so that they would know that I am the LORD</b><br>The phrase underscores the purpose of the Sabbath as a means of revelation. It was designed to deepen the Israelites' understanding of God's character and His sovereignty. By observing the Sabbath, the Israelites acknowledged God's lordship and His role as the Creator and Sustainer of life. This knowledge was not just intellectual but relational, fostering a deeper connection with God.<p><b>who sanctifies them</b><br>Sanctification refers to the process of being set apart for a holy purpose. In the context of the Old Testament, God sanctified Israel by choosing them as His people and giving them His laws. The Sabbath was a tool for sanctification, providing a regular opportunity for spiritual renewal and reflection. It pointed forward to the ultimate sanctification through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). The Sabbath thus serves as a type of the rest and sanctification found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were in a covenant relationship with Him.

Here the Lord takes the initiative, demonstrating grace to a people fresh out of bondage (<a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>).<p>&#8211; The setting in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/20.htm">Ezekiel 20</a> reminds us that even in rebellion God recalls His generous acts, underscoring both His justice and His mercy (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My Sabbaths</b><p>&#8211; They are &#8220;My&#8221; Sabbaths: God&#8217;s own possession entrusted to His people (<a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm">Leviticus 19:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Plural &#8220;Sabbaths&#8221; points to the weekly Sabbath and the calendar of rest days&#8212;the whole rhythm of cessation and celebration (<a href="/leviticus/23-1.htm">Leviticus 23:1-44</a>).<p>&#8211; By calling them &#8220;My,&#8221; the Lord distinguishes His appointed rest from pagan festivals (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31-32</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>) and asserts sovereign authority over time itself (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a sign between us</b><p>&#8211; A sign is a visible marker of an invisible covenant, much like the rainbow for Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-13</a>) or circumcision for Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>).<p>&#8211; The Sabbath distinguishes Israel from surrounding nations (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>). When Israel ceases labor on the seventh day, the world sees a people ordered by trust in God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23-30</a>).<p>&#8211; Signs function both ways: God remembers His promises, and the people remember their identity (<a href="/numbers/15-37.htm">Numbers 15:37-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they would know</b><p>&#8211; Knowledge here is experiential, not merely intellectual (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>). By practicing Sabbath, Israel encounters God&#8217;s character every week.<p>&#8211; The pause from work teaches dependence (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>). It reminds them they were slaves who now rest because of divine redemption (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>).<p>&#8211; This knowing guards against idolatry; ignoring Sabbath led to spiritual amnesia and eventual exile (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH) signals God&#8217;s self-revealed, unchanging nature (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Every Sabbath rest testifies that the Creator still reigns (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6-8</a>).<p>&#8211; Recognizing Him as LORD calls for exclusive loyalty (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>) and frames all of life under His kingship (<a href="/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sanctifies them</b><p>&#8211; Sanctify means &#8220;to set apart&#8221; for holy purposes.

By resting, Israel declares trust in the Creator-Redeemer, experiences His sanctifying power, and bears witness to the surrounding world that He alone is God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">I gave them my sabbaths.</span>--"Not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers" (<a href="/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a>). The Sabbath, like circumcision, was an institution far older than the period here spoken of, but was now commanded anew, and made the especial pledge of the covenant between God and His people. The verse is a quotation from <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13</a>; and every one must have remarked the great stress everywhere laid in the Old Testament upon the observance of the Sabbath, and the prominence given to it among the privileges of the Divine covenant. It is plain that the day is regarded not in its mere outward character, as a day of rest, but as "a sign" of the covenant, and a means of realising it in the study of God's word, and the communion of the soul with Him. It is in these latter aspects also that the weekly day of rest still retains its inestimable value--that men "might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them my sabbaths,</span> etc. As in <a href="/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12-17</a>, the sabbath is treated as the central sign (we might almost say sacrament) of the Jewish Church, not only as a mark differencing them from other nations, but as <span class="cmt_word">between Jehovah and them</span>, a witness of their ideal relation to each other, a means of making that ideal relation a reality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
