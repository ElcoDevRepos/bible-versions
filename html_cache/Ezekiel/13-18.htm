The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, delivering a message that is not his own but from the Lord. This underscores the seriousness and authenticity of the prophecy. In biblical context, prophets often began their messages with a declaration of divine authority to distinguish their words from false prophets.<p><b>Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their wrists</b><br>"Woe" is a term of lament and impending judgment. The women mentioned are likely false prophetesses or sorceresses engaging in occult practices. Sewing magic charms on their wrists suggests the use of amulets or talismans, which were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures for protection or manipulation. This practice is condemned in the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as it represents a reliance on powers other than God.<p><b>and make veils for the heads of people of every height,</b><br>The veils could symbolize deception or concealment, possibly used in rituals or as a means to exert control over others. "People of every height" indicates that these practices were widespread, affecting individuals of all social standings. This reflects the pervasive nature of idolatry and false religion in Israel at the time, which Ezekiel frequently addresses.<p><b>in order to ensnare their souls.</b><br>The purpose of these practices is to capture or control the souls of individuals, leading them away from God. This phrase highlights the spiritual danger and manipulation involved in these occult activities. The ensnaring of souls can be seen as a metaphor for leading people into spiritual bondage, contrasting with the freedom found in following God.<p><b>Will you ensnare the souls of My people but preserve your own?</b><br>This rhetorical question exposes the hypocrisy and self-serving nature of the false prophetesses. They exploit others for personal gain while attempting to secure their own safety. The phrase "My people" indicates God's ownership and care for Israel, emphasizing the betrayal involved in leading them astray. This echoes themes found in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah, where false leaders are condemned for misleading God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophetesses.htm">False Prophetesses</a></b><br>Women in Israel who engaged in deceptive practices, using magic charms and veils to mislead the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel to condemn the false practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, who are being misled by false prophets and prophetesses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time of judgment and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_against_deception.htm">Discernment Against Deception</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant and discerning to avoid being misled by false teachings and practices that contradict God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_false_security.htm">The Danger of False Security</a></b><br>The false prophetesses offered a false sense of security, which can lead people away from true reliance on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God sees and judges all actions, especially those that lead His people astray.

The picture which he draws of a false prophetess is obviously taken from the life, and the dress, we can scarcely doubt, was one that belonged to her calling. The word for "sew" meets us in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>; and the English is an adequate rendering. For the word rendered "pillows," the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">pulvilli</span> (equivalent to "cushions"). The word here obviously denotes an article of dress, something fastened to the arms. For <span class="cmt_word">arm-holes</span> <span class="accented">read joints of the two hoods</span>, which may mean either knuckles, wrists, or (as in the Revised Version) elbows. Possibly these may have been, like the phylacteries of <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>, cases containing charms or incantations, and used as amulets. Something analogous to, if not identical with, these ornaments, is found in the "seeress wreaths," and "divining garments" of Cassandra (AEsch., 'Agamemnon,' 1237-1242), and in the "garlands" or "fillets" of the Pythian priestess in AEsch., 'Eumeu.,' 39. By some writers (Havernick) the word has been taken, as, perhaps, in the Authorized Version, for "pillows" in the larger sense, either literally as used in wanton luxury, like the "tapestry" of <a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, or figuratively, like the "wall" of the preceding section, for counsels that lulled the conscience into the slumber of a false security. Strangely enough, the Hebrew noun rendered "arm-holes" has the pronominal suffix "<span class="accented">my</span> arms<span class="accented"></span>," or "<span class="accented">my</span> hands." Keil accepts this rendering, and explains it as meaning that the prophetesses sought to "bind the arms," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to restrain the power of Jehovah. On the whole, it is safer to follow Ewald and Hitzig, as I have done above. <span class="cmt_word">Make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature.</span> The word for "kerchiefs" is again unique, but is, perhaps, a variant of the word in <a href="/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, and rendered "wimples" in the Authorized Version. There is a fair consensus of interpretations that it means, as "kerchief" means, some covering for the head, a veil that hangs down over it, like the Spanish mantilla. Its use is, perhaps, explained by the words that follow, which suggest that the veils were not worn by the prophetesses themselves, but by those who came to consult them. The former had, as it were, a whole wardrobe of such veils adapted to persons of various heights, so that in all cases it shrouded their whole form. We may, perhaps, read between the lines the thought that their utterances, like their veils, were adapted to suit every age and every taste. Analogous usages present themselves in the <span class="accented">tallith</span> of later Judaism, and the veil worn by the Roman augurs. Ezekiel paints, we may believe, what he had seen. And in those veils he had seen a net cast over the victims of the false prophetesses, a snare from which they could not escape. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye hunt,</span> etc.? The question (that form is preferable to the affirmative of the margin of the Revised Version) is one of burning indignation. Omitting the words, "that come" (which have nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to them), the second clause will run, "Will ye make your own souls live?" and the question is explained by what follows. The prophetesses were living upon the credulity of the victims over whom they cast their nets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and tell them that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
