The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, underscoring the importance of prophetic revelation in the Old Testament. The phrase "Lord GOD" translates to "Adonai Yahweh," highlighting God's sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Behold, I am against you, O Sidon:</b><br>Sidon was a prominent Phoenician city, known for its wealth and trade. Historically, Sidon was often in conflict with Israel and Judah, and its pagan practices were a source of temptation for the Israelites. God's declaration of being "against" Sidon signifies impending judgment due to its idolatry and opposition to God's people.<p><b>and I will be glorified within you:</b><br>This indicates that God's judgment will ultimately reveal His glory and righteousness. The concept of God being glorified through judgment is consistent with other biblical passages where God's holiness and justice are displayed through His actions against sin (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4, 17</a>).<p><b>They will know that I am the LORD:</b><br>A recurring theme in Ezekiel, this phrase underscores the purpose of God's actions&#8212;to reveal His identity and sovereignty to the nations. It reflects the broader biblical narrative where God's interventions serve to affirm His lordship and covenant faithfulness.<p><b>when I execute judgments against her:</b><br>The judgments against Sidon are part of God's broader plan to address sin and rebellion. This phrase connects to the prophetic tradition where God's justice is executed against nations that oppose His will, similar to the judgments against Egypt and Babylon.<p><b>and demonstrate My holiness through her:</b><br>God's holiness is a central attribute, and His actions against Sidon serve to manifest His distinctiveness and moral purity. This demonstration of holiness is not only punitive but also revelatory, showing the world the nature of a holy God who cannot tolerate sin. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's holiness being revealed through His dealings with both Israel and the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and holy God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sidon.htm">Sidon</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city, often associated with idolatry and opposition to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to Israel and surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations, and His judgments are just and righteous.
