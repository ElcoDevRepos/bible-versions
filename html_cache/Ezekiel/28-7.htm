The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, emphasizing the certainty and importance of the coming judgment. The "foreigners" refer to invading armies, historically understood as the Babylonians, who were used by God as instruments of judgment. This reflects a common biblical theme where God uses foreign nations to execute His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria and <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a> with the Chaldeans.<p><b>the most ruthless of nations</b><br>The Babylonians are often described as a fierce and ruthless people, known for their military prowess and harsh treatment of conquered peoples. This description underscores the severity of the impending judgment. Historically, Babylon was a dominant power in the ancient Near East, feared for its brutal conquests. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of Babylon as a tool of divine retribution, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-7.htm">Habakkuk 1:7</a>.<p><b>They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom</b><br>The "beauty of your wisdom" likely refers to the wealth, culture, and perceived invincibility of Tyre, the city being addressed. Tyre was renowned for its wisdom, trade, and craftsmanship, as noted in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>. The drawing of swords signifies a violent confrontation, indicating that the city's wisdom and achievements would not protect it from destruction. This echoes the biblical principle that human wisdom is ultimately futile against divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>.<p><b>and will defile your splendor</b><br>The "splendor" of Tyre includes its wealth, architecture, and status as a major trading hub. The defilement signifies not just physical destruction but also a loss of honor and prestige. This reflects the biblical theme of pride leading to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>. The defilement also serves as a metaphor for spiritual corruption, suggesting that Tyre's external beauty masked internal moral decay, similar to the critique of Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
