In the context of Ezekiel's visions, God often speaks directly to him, providing instructions and revelations about Israel's future. This direct communication underscores the authority and divine origin of the message.<p><b>Son of man,</b><br>The term "son of man" is used frequently in Ezekiel, highlighting the prophet's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. It serves to remind Ezekiel of his position as a mortal being receiving divine revelation. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," linking His mission to the prophetic tradition.<p><b>this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>This phrase introduces a divine pronouncement, affirming the authority and sovereignty of God. It is a common formula in prophetic literature, ensuring that the message is not of human origin but from the Lord Himself. This underscores the importance and reliability of the instructions that follow.<p><b>&#8216;These are the statutes for the altar</b><br>The statutes refer to specific regulations or laws concerning the altar, which is central to Israelite worship. The altar's construction and use are critical for maintaining proper worship and sacrificial practices. In the broader biblical context, the altar represents a place of atonement and communion with God, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<p><b>on the day it is constructed,</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific time when these regulations are to be implemented, highlighting the importance of proper dedication and consecration of the altar. The construction of the altar is a significant event, symbolizing a new beginning for worship and the restoration of proper relationship with God.<p><b>so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The offering was completely consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God's will. This practice points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who offered Himself completely for the sins of humanity.<p><b>and blood may be splattered on it:</b><br>The splattering of blood on the altar is a key element of the sacrificial system, signifying purification and atonement. Blood, representing life, was used to cleanse and sanctify, pointing to the necessity of a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. This foreshadows the New Testament teaching on the blood of Christ, which cleanses believers from sin and establishes a new covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with conveying them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provides instructions for worship and the construction of the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A central element in the temple, the altar is where sacrifices are made, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices that are completely consumed by fire, representing total dedication to God and atonement for sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blood_sprinkling.htm">Blood Sprinkling</a></b><br>A ritual act signifying purification and the establishment of a covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Obedience in Worship</a></b><br>God's detailed instructions for the altar remind us of the importance of obedience in worship.

The verse weaves together themes of divine authority, human dependence, immediate holiness, wholehearted devotion, and necessary atonement&#8212;each strand pointing ahead to the ultimate fulfillment in the perfect sacrifice of Christ while affirming that, in every age, access to God is on His terms alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">In the day when they shall make it.--</span>This looks to the future, and implies that the whole structure of the Temple, and its acceptance by the manifestation of the Divine glory, though necessarily represented in the vision as already done, were yet in the future. The phrase, "in the day when they shall make it," is intended only to require the consecration of the altar before it is used. The actual time occupied by the consecration (<a href="/context/ezekiel/43-25.htm" title="Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.">Ezekiel 43:25-26</a>) was to be seven days, as in <a href="/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ordinances of the altar.</span> These were not the regulations for the sacrificial worship to be afterwards performed upon this altar, but the rites to be observed at its consecration when the day should arrive for its construction. As the altar in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-46</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11-33</a>), and that in Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63-66</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-4.htm">2 Chronicles 7:4-10</a>), so was this in Ezekiel's "house" dedicated by a special ceremonial before being brought into ordinary use. The particular ritual observed by Solomon is not described in detail; but a comparison between that enjoined upon and practiced by Moses with that revealed to and published by Ezekiel shows that while in some respects they agreed, in other important particulars they differed. In both the ceremony largely consisted in offering sacrifice and smearing blood, and lasted seven days; but in the former the ceremony was performed exclusively by Moses, consisted, in addition to the above, of an anointing of the altar, the holy utensils, and the tabernacle itself with oil, and was associated with the consecration of the priests; whereas in the latter, in addition to some variations in the sacrificial victims, which will be noted in the course of exposition, the priests should bear an active part - there should be no anointing with oil, and no consecration of the priests, the priesthood being assumed as already existing. If in Ezekiel's ritual there was no mention of a cleansing of the sanctuary (that of <a href="/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> referring to a special ease), but only of the altar, that was sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Jehovah was already in the "house." The final clause, to <span class="cmt_word">offer burnt offerings thereon</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and to sprinkle blood thereon</span>, indicates the purpose for which the altar was to be used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
