In biblical times, Cush was known for its warriors and was a significant power. Put is generally identified with the region west of Egypt, possibly modern-day Libya. Lud is often associated with the Lydians, an ancient people from Asia Minor. These nations were known for their military prowess and alliances with Egypt. Their mention here signifies the widespread impact of God's judgment, extending beyond Egypt to its allies and neighbors.<p><b>and all the various peoples</b><br>This phrase indicates the inclusion of diverse ethnic groups and tribes that were part of or allied with Egypt. It emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the impending judgment, affecting not just the major nations but also smaller groups that were interconnected with Egypt's political and military structure.<p><b>as well as Libya</b><br>Libya, located to the west of Egypt, was another significant ally.

This prophecy foretells the downfall of Egypt and its allies through military defeat. The imagery of the sword is common in prophetic literature, symbolizing God's instrument of judgment. This aligns with other biblical prophecies where nations are judged for their actions and alliances, underscoring the sovereignty of God over all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>Often identified with the region south of Egypt, possibly modern-day Sudan or Ethiopia.

Cushites were famed warriors (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>) and long-time allies of Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1&#8211;2</a>). By singling them out, God shows that even a distant, powerful partner cannot shield Egypt. The prophecy literally came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s forces swept through the Nile Valley (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a>). That historical fulfillment reminds us that when God declares judgment, no geographic distance or military reputation can resist His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put</b><p>Next is &#8220;Put,&#8221; another Hamite nation (<a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>) commonly linked with the western regions of North Africa. Put provided mercenary soldiers to Egypt (<a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>). The Lord&#8217;s wording&#8212;&#8220;Put &#8230; will fall with Egypt&#8221;&#8212;underscores personal accountability: aligning with a rebellious power brings shared consequences (<a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> mirrors the same roster, confirming Ezekiel&#8217;s list and reinforcing Scripture&#8217;s harmony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lud</b><p>&#8220;Lud&#8221; is mentioned third. While sometimes associated with Lydia in Asia Minor, Scripture also depicts Ludites as skilled archers employed by foreign armies (<a href="/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>). Wherever they were located, their famed weaponry could not stay God&#8217;s hand. The literal accuracy of the prophecy is evident: Babylon&#8217;s reach eventually extended even to the western Anatolian coast, fulfilling Ezekiel&#8217;s words and proving that human strength is never a match for divine decree (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the various peoples</b><p>The phrase &#8220;and all the various peoples&#8221; widens the net to every auxiliary tribe, caravan community, and mercenary band Egypt could muster. God leaves no loophole. Earlier in the chapter, He had already warned, &#8220;All her allies will be shattered&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>). This universal wording anticipates later prophecies such as <a href="/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3</a>, where every nation standing against God&#8217;s plan faces defeat. The lesson is clear: broad coalitions cannot nullify divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Libya</b><p>Ezekiel then circles back to &#8220;Libya,&#8221; highlighting another segment of North Africa (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>). Some translations merge Libya with Put, yet the separate mention here stresses completeness&#8212;every region, whether eastern or western Sahara, would taste the same sword. History records Libyan garrisons falling under Babylonian expansion, matching God&#8217;s forecast (<a href="/ezekiel/30-17.htm">Ezekiel 30:17</a>). The repetition drives home the certainty of judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>men of the covenant land</b><p>&#8220;The men of the covenant land&#8221; likely refers to Judeans who sought refuge in Egypt after Jerusalem&#8217;s fall (<a href="/jeremiah/43-4.htm">Jeremiah 43:4&#8211;7</a>). Though heirs of the covenant, they had chosen Egypt&#8217;s protection over the Lord&#8217;s promise. Their inclusion warns that religious pedigree cannot override disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a>). God expected His people to trust His word; siding with Egypt placed them under the same sentence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will fall with Egypt by the sword</b><p>The closing clause unifies every name under a single outcome: &#8220;will fall with Egypt by the sword.&#8221; God&#8217;s verdict was executed in 568-567 BC when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt, fulfilling <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29&#8211;32</a> (compare <a href="/jeremiah/46-13.htm">Jeremiah 46:13-26</a>). Yet the language also foreshadows final judgment when nations opposing God will suffer a similar fate (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). The sword symbolizes decisive, inescapable justice (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>), affirming that God&#8217;s prophecies are both historically precise and eschatologically relevant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> lists Cush, Put, Lud, every assorted people, Libya, and even covenant refugees, declaring they &#8220;will fall with Egypt by the sword.&#8221; Each name highlights a real nation or group that literally shared Egypt&#8217;s downfall under Babylon. The passage proves that alliances, reputation, and heritage offer no refuge from God&#8217;s righteous judgment. History validates the prophecy, and its enduring message calls every generation to place trust not in human power but in the Lord who always keeps His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia.</span>--Ethiopia and Egypt were closely connected, and during much of their history were often under one government. Ethiopian soldiers served in great numbers in the Egyptian armies. Libya and Lydia are an unfortunate substitution for the original terms, Phut and Lud, which are preserved in <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10</a>, where see Note. They are there mentioned as furnishing mercenaries to the Tyrian army; and it is known historically that they supplied them to a still greater extent to the Egyptian army.<p><span class= "bld">All the mingled people, and Chub.--</span>There is the same expression, "mingled people," in reference to Egypt, in <a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm" title="And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,">Jeremiah 25:20</a>. In the connection here it may be understood especially of the foreign mercenaries from various quarters in the Egyptian armies. Chub is a name entirely unknown. Various conjectures have been hazarded, and various changes in the text proposed, but none are supported by sufficient evidence. It evidently denotes some ally of Egypt, possibly Nubia.<p><span class= "bld">Men of the land that is in league.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">sons of the land of the covenant.</span> The ancient interpreters, St. Jerome and Theodoret, understood this expression of the Jews who had sought refuge from Nebuchadnezzar in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 42, 43, 44), to whom Jeremiah had expressly prophesied that the sword and famine of which they were afraid should overtake them there (<a href="/context/jeremiah/42-16.htm" title="Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.">Jeremiah 42:16-18</a>). This interpretation is supported by the translation of the Septuagint, made in Egypt, "land of my covenant." The objection made to this view, that Palestine is never called "the land of the covenant," and that this must therefore signify some unknown country in alliance with Egypt at the time, seems rather specious than real. If it happens that this expression is never used of Palestine, yet that was unquestionably the land of the people of the covenant, and a particular expression may very well be used once without occurring again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Libya</span>. Here the Authorized Version gives (rightly enough, though inconsistently) the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Phut</span>, which is reproduced in the Revised Version. The <span class="accented">Lydians</span>, in like manner, stand for Lud; but we have to remember, as before (<a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>), that they are the African, and not the Asiatic, people of that name. In <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> the two nations are named among the auxiliaries of Egypt. Possibly the similarity of name may have led to the term being used also for the Lydian and Ionian forces enlisted by Psam-metichus I. (Herod., 3:4); but there seems more reason for including these in the <span class="cmt_word">mingled people</span> that are next mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Chub</span>, or Cub (Revised Version), is found here only, and has consequently given occasion to many guesses Havernick connects it with the <span class="accented">Kufa</span>, a district of Media, often named in Egyptian monuments; Michaelis, with Kobe on the Ethiopian coast of the Indian Ocean; Maurer, with Cob, a city of Mauretania; Gesenius, Ewald, and Bunsen suggest the reading <span class="accented">Nub</span>, and identify it with Nubia; Keil and Smend adopt the form Lub, found in the Lubim of <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a> and <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>. On the whole, there are no adequate data for the solution of the problem. <span class="cmt_word">The men of the land that is in league.</span> Here, again, we are in a region of many conjectures. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig and Kliefoth (following Jerome and the LXX., which gives, "the land of my covenant") take it of Canaan, as being the land in covenant with Jehovah (<a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2, 20</a>;
