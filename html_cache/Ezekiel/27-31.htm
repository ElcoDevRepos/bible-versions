It symbolized deep grief and loss. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, this act signifies the profound sorrow of the surrounding nations over the fall of Tyre, a major trading hub. The shaving of heads also indicates a public display of mourning, showing the impact of Tyre's downfall on its allies and trading partners.<p><b>and wrap themselves in sackcloth.</b><br>Sackcloth, a coarse material made from goat's hair, was traditionally worn during periods of mourning and repentance (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). It served as a physical manifestation of inner sorrow and humility. The use of sackcloth in this passage underscores the severity of Tyre's destruction and the widespread grief it caused. This imagery is consistent with other biblical accounts where sackcloth is used to express deep distress and contrition.<p><b>They will weep over you with anguish of soul</b><br>Weeping with "anguish of soul" conveys an intense emotional response, reflecting the deep personal and communal impact of Tyre's demise. This phrase highlights the emotional depth of the lamentation, suggesting that the fall of Tyre was not only an economic loss but also a relational and cultural one. The phrase "anguish of soul" is reminiscent of other biblical expressions of profound grief, such as David's lament for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>).<p><b>and bitter mourning.</b><br>"Bitter mourning" emphasizes the intensity and acuteness of the sorrow experienced. This type of mourning is often associated with irreversible loss and tragedy. In the biblical context, bitterness in mourning can also imply a sense of injustice or the harshness of the situation (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>, <a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15</a>). The fall of Tyre, a city known for its wealth and influence, would have been a shocking event, leading to widespread lamentation among those who depended on its prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A prominent ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade.

The action underscores how completely the Lord will bring down this proud trading power (<a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>; 27:35).<p>&#8211; It also shows that even those who prospered through Tyre&#8217;s wealth will at last recognize that no nation can stand when God judges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wrap themselves in sackcloth.</b><p>&#8211; Sackcloth, a rough goat-hair fabric, was worn in times of national calamity, personal sin, or deep grief (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>).<p>&#8211; By describing whole crews of ships in sackcloth, Ezekiel highlights the scope of the catastrophe: Tyre&#8217;s fall will impoverish and unnerve every partner in her vast commercial network (<a href="/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8211; The image echoes earlier prophecies against proud cities like Nineveh, where business leaders must exchange luxury for lowliness (<a href="/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will weep over you with anguish of soul and bitter mourning.</b><p>&#8211;

Their &#8220;bitter mourning&#8221; mirrors the laments raised over Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9&#8211;19</a>, reminding us that worldly wealth cannot shield a nation from divine justice.<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s purpose is not cruelty; it is a solemn warning that pride and exploitation invite His righteous judgment (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The grief of Tyre&#8217;s partners foreshadows the ultimate lament of all who trust in material glory rather than the Lord (<a href="/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-31.htm">Ezekiel 27:31</a> portrays an international chorus of sailors and merchants shaved, clothed in sackcloth, and sobbing over Tyre&#8217;s sudden ruin.
