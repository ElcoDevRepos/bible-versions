Historically, both kingdoms sought political alliances with surrounding nations, such as Egypt and Assyria, which often led to spiritual compromise and idolatry. This pursuit of foreign men can be seen as a metaphor for Israel and Judah's unfaithfulness to God, as they sought security and identity outside of their covenant relationship with Him. The sending of messengers indicates a deliberate and intentional act of seeking these alliances, reflecting the spiritual adultery condemned by the prophets.<p><b>and behold, when they arrived, you bathed for them,</b><br>The act of bathing signifies preparation and purification, but in this context, it is a preparation for sin rather than holiness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bathing was often associated with ritual purification, but here it is twisted into a preparation for seduction and idolatry. This reflects the spiritual state of Israel and Judah, who were outwardly preparing themselves for alliances that would lead them further from God. The imagery suggests a readiness to engage in practices that were contrary to their covenant with God, highlighting their spiritual infidelity.<p><b>painted your eyes,</b><br>Eye painting, or the use of cosmetics, was a common practice in ancient cultures, often associated with seduction and allure. In the context of this passage, it symbolizes the seductive nature of Israel and Judah's idolatry and their attempts to make themselves attractive to foreign nations and their gods. This act of painting the eyes can be seen as a metaphor for the ways in which the people of God tried to conform to the practices and appearances of the pagan nations around them, rather than remaining distinct and holy as God had called them to be.<p><b>and adorned yourself with jewelry.</b><br>Adorning with jewelry further emphasizes the theme of seduction and preparation for unfaithfulness. Jewelry in the ancient world was often a symbol of wealth, status, and beauty, and in this context, it represents the lengths to which Israel and Judah went to make themselves appealing to foreign powers and gods. This adornment can also be seen as a counterfeit of the true beauty and adornment that comes from a relationship with God, as described in passages like <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>, where inner beauty is valued over outward adornment. The use of jewelry here underscores the superficial and deceptive nature of Israel and Judah's alliances and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively.

Instead of waiting to be tempted, they took the initiative, &#8220;sending messengers&#8221; to distant nations&#8212;Assyria, Egypt, Babylon&#8212;looking for political help that always brought idolatry with it (<a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This active pursuit shows deliberate, determined unfaithfulness. Rather than trusting the LORD, they courted those who did not know Him, echoing the warning of <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a> that &#8220;friendship with the world is hostility toward God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant people possessed every reason to rely on Him alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), yet they chose foreign &#8220;lovers,&#8221; proving how sin can push us to chase what finally destroys.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, when they arrived</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;behold&#8221; spotlights eagerness: the moment the envoys returned, the cities jumped into action.

They took the first step, eagerly welcomed corruption, cleansed the outside while neglecting the heart, relied on seductive looks, and misused God&#8217;s gifts to entice the world. The verse exposes intentional, cosmetic religion that substitutes worldly strategies for covenant loyalty.
