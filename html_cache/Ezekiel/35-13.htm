In biblical context, boasting against God signifies a deep-seated rebellion and lack of reverence. Historically, Edom, descended from Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel, the descendants of Jacob. This enmity is rooted in the Genesis account of Jacob and Esau, where Esau sold his birthright to Jacob. The boasting here can be seen as Edom's prideful attitude and their belief in their own strength and security, despite God's sovereignty. This is reminiscent of other biblical instances where nations or individuals boasted against God, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>, where Assyria is rebuked for its arrogance.<p><b>and multiplied your words against Me.</b><br>The multiplication of words against God suggests persistent and repeated blasphemy or slander. This indicates not just a single act of defiance but a continual pattern of disrespect and opposition. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, words held significant power, and to speak against a deity was a serious offense. This phrase underscores the gravity of Edom's sin, as they not only opposed God but did so repeatedly and with increasing intensity. This can be paralleled with the behavior of other nations in the Bible, such as Babylon, which also spoke arrogantly against God (<a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8-10</a>).<p><b>I heard it Myself!</b><br>This declaration emphasizes God's omniscience and His personal involvement in the affairs of nations. It serves as a reminder that no action or word escapes God's notice. Theologically, this reflects the belief in a God who is both transcendent and immanent, aware of and responsive to human actions. This assurance of divine awareness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, which affirms that God, who created the ear, surely hears. It also serves as a warning that God will hold nations and individuals accountable for their words and actions, as seen in the judgment pronounced on Edom in the surrounding passages of <a href="/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Here He pinpoints the root: arrogant speech directed at God Himself.<p>&#8226; Boasting is not mere trash talk; it is a heart posture of self-exaltation (<a href="/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>). When Edom ridiculed Israel in her distress, Edom effectively mocked Israel&#8217;s covenant God (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture links sinful speech to the overflow of the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34-37</a>). What Edom said exposed entrenched rebellion.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: words reveal allegiance. Consistent contempt for God or His people signals spiritual opposition (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and multiplied your words against Me</b><p>&#8226; The charge intensifies: not a one-time slip, but repeated, calculated defiance (<a href="/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Multiplied&#8221; underscores persistence. Edom&#8217;s insults kept pace with Israel&#8217;s suffering&#8212;most likely during Jerusalem&#8217;s fall (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture highlights the cumulative weight of sinful speech: &#8220;The tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a>). Continuous verbal sin stores up judgment (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God takes note when antagonism becomes habitual. Every added word enlarges guilt (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I heard it Myself!</b><p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s declaration is personal and emphatic: divine omniscience cancels any hope of secrecy (<a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing implies impending action. Just as He &#8220;heard&#8221; Israel&#8217;s groaning in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>), He now &#8220;hears&#8221; Edom&#8217;s arrogance, guaranteeing retribution (<a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This assurance comforts God&#8217;s people: mockery against them never escapes His notice (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>).<p>&#8226; For the unrepentant, the same truth warns that no word is lost in the wind (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>). Accountability is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a> exposes Edom&#8217;s sustained, arrogant speech against the LORD.
