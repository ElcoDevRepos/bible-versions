It underscores the distinction between the divine and human, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator of God's messages. This title is also used extensively in the New Testament, particularly by Jesus Christ to refer to Himself, emphasizing His incarnation and fulfillment of prophetic roles.<p><b>because Tyre has said of Jerusalem</b><br>Tyre was a powerful and wealthy city-state located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its trade and commerce. The relationship between Tyre and Jerusalem was complex, involving both cooperation and rivalry. Historically, Tyre had benefited from trade with Jerusalem, but the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 586 BC presented an opportunity for Tyre to expand its influence. This phrase sets the stage for God's judgment against Tyre for its attitude towards Jerusalem's downfall.<p><b>&#8216;Aha! The gate to the nations is broken;</b><br>The exclamation "Aha!" indicates Tyre's gloating over Jerusalem's destruction. Jerusalem was strategically located and served as a significant trade route, often referred to as a "gate" to the nations. With Jerusalem's fall, Tyre saw an opportunity to dominate trade routes without competition. This attitude reflects a lack of compassion and a self-serving mindset, which God condemns.<p><b>it has swung open to me;</b><br>Tyre perceived Jerusalem's destruction as an opportunity for its own gain, believing that the absence of Jerusalem would allow Tyre to expand its commercial reach. This phrase highlights Tyre's opportunistic nature and its focus on material gain. The imagery of a gate swinging open suggests unrestricted access and opportunity, which Tyre sought to exploit.<p><b>now that she lies in ruins I will be filled,&#8217;</b><br>Tyre's expectation of being "filled" indicates its anticipation of increased wealth and prosperity at Jerusalem's expense. This reflects a broader biblical theme where nations or individuals who rejoice in the downfall of others are often subject to divine judgment. The prophetic literature frequently addresses the consequences of pride and self-exaltation, as seen in the eventual judgment pronounced against Tyre in the following verses. This serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, ensuring that no nation or city can ultimately prosper through the misfortune of others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient and wealthy Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its commerce and trade.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant in biblical history as the spiritual and political center of the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The divine response to the pride and arrogance of nations, as seen in the prophetic declarations against Tyre.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/pride_leads_to_downfall.htm">Pride Leads to Downfall</a></b><br>Tyre's arrogance in rejoicing over Jerusalem's destruction serves as a warning against pride.

By omitting all the words in italics in this verse a better idea is obtained of the exultation of Tyre over the fall of Jerusalem.<p>This exultation is described as of a purely selfish and commercial character, and shows nothing of the spitefulness and religious animosity of the nations mentioned in the previous chapter. Jerusalem had been made in the days of Solomon the great commercial emporium of the inland trade from Arabia, and even from India, as well as the negotiator of products between Egypt and the Hittites and other northern nations. Doubtless something of this commercial importance still remained to Jerusalem in her decay, of which we have already seen evidence in Ezekiel 16; but however this may have been, a considerable city, situated as Jerusalem was, must of necessity have been the centre of many of those transactions between the surrounding nations which Tyre would gladly have monopolised for herself. Hence her exultation: "Jerusalem being destroyed, all that gave her importance among the nations must come to increase my prosperity."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because that Tyrus</span>, etc. As the nearest great commercial city, the Venice of the ancient world, Tyre, from the days of David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>) onward, had been prominent in the eyes of the statesmen and prophets of Judah; and Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of <a href="/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="/amos/1-9.htm">Amos 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, in dealing with it.

The interpolated "now" indicates what is, of course, implied, that Tyre expects her prosperity to increase in proportion to the decline and fall of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/26-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1440;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Tyre</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6865.htm">Strong's 6865: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tyre -- a Phoenician city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1448;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1460;&#1433;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Aha!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1889.htm">Strong's 1889: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aha!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">The gate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(dal&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1817.htm">Strong's 1817: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something swinging, the valve of a, door</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
