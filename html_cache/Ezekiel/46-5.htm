An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, approximately equivalent to 22 liters or about half a bushel. This specific measure for the grain offering with the ram indicates a standard of worship and sacrifice that reflects the order and holiness required in the temple service. The ram, often used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizes strength and leadership, pointing to the need for a strong commitment in worship. This offering aligns with the Levitical laws found in <a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>, where specific measures are prescribed for offerings, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able</b><br>This phrase introduces flexibility in the offering, allowing the worshiper to give according to their means. The lamb, a common sacrificial animal, often represents innocence and purity, and is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The allowance for the offerer to give "as much as he is able" reflects God's understanding and grace towards individual circumstances, encouraging heartfelt worship rather than mere ritual compliance. This principle is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul writes about giving as one has decided in their heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion.<p><b>along with a hin of oil per ephah</b><br>A hin is a unit of liquid measure, approximately 3.7 liters or about one gallon. Oil in biblical times was a valuable commodity, used for anointing, cooking, and as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of oil with the grain offering signifies the anointing and presence of the Spirit in the act of worship. This combination of grain and oil offerings is reminiscent of the peace offerings described in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>, where oil is mixed with fine flour, symbolizing the richness and fullness of life in fellowship with God. The precise measure of oil per ephah underscores the importance of balance and completeness in worship, ensuring that offerings are made with sincerity and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

This echoes earlier statutes where a set grain portion went with larger animals (<a href="/numbers/15-6.htm">Numbers 15:6-7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a>).<p>- A consistent measure guards purity of worship: everyone, priest and prince alike, brings the same amount, reflecting God&#8217;s orderliness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>- Grain offerings in <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a> served as a &#8220;memorial portion,&#8221; fragrant and pleasing to the LORD, pointing to thankful dependence on His provision (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9-13</a>).<p>- For us, the principle is clear: when God prescribes something, precision matters. Worship is not improvised but shaped by His revealed will (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able</b><p>- Unlike the set ephah for a ram, the worshiper bringing lambs may give &#8220;as much as he is able.&#8221; This flexibility preserves personal devotion while still honoring the required sacrifice (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p>- Lambs were the more common animal (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). Allowing variable grain amounts keeps the door open for rich and poor alike (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>).<p>- The balance of structure and freedom mirrors God&#8217;s heart: He establishes standards yet looks for willing, generous hearts (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with a hin of oil per ephah</b><p>- A &#8220;hin&#8221; is about a gallon. Blending oil with each ephah ties back to <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, where oil enriched the daily offering.<p>- Oil signifies consecration and the Spirit&#8217;s enabling (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). Every measured gift is saturated with divine empowerment&#8212;worship is never merely human effort.<p>- The consistent ratio (one hin / ephah) keeps the offering from becoming dry or mechanical; it remains living and fragrant (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Ezekiel 46:5</a> lays out a pattern of worship that is at once orderly and personal. A fixed ephah with each ram underscores God&#8217;s unchanging standards. A flexible amount with each lamb invites heartfelt generosity. The accompanying oil ensures every gift is Spirit-touched and acceptable. Together these details remind us that true worship joins obedience, willingness, and divine anointing&#8212;elements still vital whenever God&#8217;s people draw near.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The grain offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
