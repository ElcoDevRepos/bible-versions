The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating that the message is not of human origin but is a direct communication from God. This underscores the authority and authenticity of the prophecy. In the context of Ezekiel, a prophet during the Babylonian exile, this phrase signifies that God is actively communicating with His people even in their time of judgment and displacement. The phrase "came to me" highlights the personal nature of the revelation to Ezekiel, marking him as a chosen vessel for God's message. This is consistent with other prophetic books where God speaks directly to His prophets (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). The use of "saying" introduces the specific content of the message that follows, which in this chapter includes a parable and its interpretation, reflecting the teaching method of using stories to convey deeper truths. This method is also seen in the teachings of Jesus, who often used parables to reveal spiritual truths (e.g., <a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's word.

After the previous visions (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>), this &#8220;now&#8221; alerts us that God is about to reveal something new and urgent, much as &#8220;Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>) or &#8220;Now the word of the LORD came to Haggai&#8221; (<a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>) introduced decisive messages in their day.<p>&#8226; The adverb reminds us that God speaks into real moments of history; His timing is precise and purposeful (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underlines that what follows is not Ezekiel&#8217;s meditation but divine revelation. Scripture repeatedly affirms this source: &#8220;The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>) and &#8220;Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Because it is the LORD&#8217;s word, it carries absolute authority (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;9</a>) and unfailing efficacy (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The Bible itself equates God&#8217;s word with truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>); therefore every part of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a> can be trusted, including its prophetic symbolism and future fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>&#8226; God personally selects Ezekiel as His messenger. Like Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Isaiah in the temple (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), Ezekiel experiences God&#8217;s direct approach.<p>&#8226; This underscores the prophet&#8217;s role as a conduit, not the originator, of revelation. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a> notes, &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The personal reception also implies accountability: Ezekiel must relay the message faithfully (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; The term introduces the content that follows&#8212;the parable of the two eagles and the vine (<a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3&#8211;10</a>). God does not leave His servants guessing; He speaks in clear, intelligible words (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, when God speaks, creation responds (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) and history shifts (<a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8&#8211;13</a>). The upcoming oracle will explain Judah&#8217;s political alliances, Babylon&#8217;s dominion, and ultimately foreshadow Messiah&#8217;s reign (<a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The voice of the LORD is powerful&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>); therefore the &#8220;saying&#8221; that follows will surely come to pass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1</a> is more than a narrative transition; it testifies that at a specific moment God delivered His authoritative, unerring word directly to His prophet, ensuring that what follows carries divine power, historical certainty, and enduring relevance for God&#8217;s people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/17-1.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 17:1 The word of Yahweh came to me (Ezek.
