The "cubs" represent the young princes or kings. In the historical context, this could refer to Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, who was made king after his father's death. The imagery of a lioness and her cubs is used to depict strength and potential, as lions were common symbols of power and royalty in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and he became a young lion</b><br>The transformation from a cub to a young lion signifies the maturation and rise to power of the young king. In the context of Ezekiel, this could be seen as Jehoahaz's brief reign as king. The lion imagery continues to emphasize strength and authority, but also hints at potential aggression and dominance, which were characteristics expected of a ruler. This transformation also reflects the expectations placed on the young king to lead and protect his people.<p><b>After learning to tear his prey</b><br>This phrase indicates the development of the young king's ability to rule and exert power, possibly through military conquests or political maneuvers. The act of tearing prey suggests a violent or aggressive approach to leadership, which aligns with the historical accounts of Jehoahaz's reign, marked by conflict and struggle. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of leaders being shepherds or protectors of their people, though in this case, it suggests a more predatory role.<p><b>he devoured men</b><br>The culmination of the young lion's development is depicted in his destructive actions. This phrase can be interpreted as the king's oppressive rule or the consequences of his leadership, leading to the suffering or downfall of his subjects. Historically, Jehoahaz's reign was short-lived, and he was eventually taken captive by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt. This outcome serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the moral responsibilities of leadership. Theologically, it reflects the consequences of straying from God's covenant and the resulting judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lioness.htm">The Lioness</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the nation of Israel, particularly the royal line of Judah.

Jehoahaz reigned only three months, yet he immediately wielded royal power (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31-32</a>).<p>- The image is not merely political; it carries moral weight: leadership is meant to protect (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>), but this lion&#8217;s power foreshadows abuse (<a href="/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>).<p>- God had warned that kings must rule in the fear of the Lord or face judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2-5</a>). The metaphor underlines accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After learning to tear his prey</b><p>- &#8220;Learning&#8221; implies deliberate practice. Jehoahaz quickly absorbed the ruthless methods of surrounding pagan rulers (<a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>).<p>- The prey is his own people; injustice inside Judah was the training ground (<a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>).<p>- Such conduct shows how personal sin in leadership becomes systemic corruption (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23-24</a>).<p>- The repetition of violent imagery prepares the reader for the divine response soon described in verses 4-9.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He devoured men</b><p>- The phrase stresses bloodshed and oppression. Jehoahaz&#8217;s short reign was marked by &#8220;evil in the sight of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>).<p>- Devouring men violates covenant law, which commands the king to &#8220;execute justice and righteousness, and deliver the oppressed&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>).<p>- Because the king consumed his subjects rather than cared for them, God allowed Pharaoh Neco to capture him, fulfilling the warning that a violent ruler&#8217;s life is cut short (<a href="/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/19-4.htm">Ezekiel 19:4</a>).<p>- The devastation underscores <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>: sin&#8217;s wages reach leaders and nations alike.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> paints a vivid portrait of a Judahite prince&#8212;historically Jehoahaz&#8212;who rose under the nation&#8217;s care, seized kingly strength, practiced oppression, and ultimately harmed his own people. The verse exposes the tragedy of God-given authority twisted into violence, affirming that when leaders ignore covenant responsibilities, divine judgment swiftly follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">It became a young lion.</span>--There can be no doubt (see <a href="/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>) of the reference of this to Jehoahaz.

These two are mentioned as examples of all the other kings after Josiah. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah are simply passed over, although it may be that the prophet looked upon them as creatures of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar rather than as legitimate kings of Israel. Jehoiakim, moreover, died in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah was at this moment still upon the throne.<p><span class= "bld">It devoured men.</span>--This at once keeps up the figure, and has also its special justification in the evil courses of Jehoahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm" title="And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.">2Kings 23:32</a>). He is represented as growing up and being like the heathen kings around. See also, in <a href="/ezekiel/19-2.htm" title="And say, What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.">Ezekiel 19:2</a>, Israel as a whole is represented as going aside from her high calling as a theocracy, and making herself "like the nations round about." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The whelp, as ver. 4 shows, is Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum (<a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>), who "did evil" in the sight of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>), the words that follow pointing to cruelty and oppression like that of Zedekiah.
