In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to the nations, using the prophet as His mouthpiece. This underscores the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's ministry, where he conveys messages of judgment and restoration. The phrase "the Lord GOD" highlights the covenant name of God, Yahweh, indicating His eternal and unchanging nature.<p><b>&#8216;Behold, O Tyre,</b><br>Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its wealth and maritime prowess. It was located on the Mediterranean coast, comprising a mainland settlement and an island fortress. Tyre's economic power came from its trade networks and its production of purple dye, a luxury item in the ancient world. The city's pride and reliance on its strategic position are key themes in the prophetic judgments against it.<p><b>I am against you,</b><br>This declaration of divine opposition is significant, as it indicates that Tyre's actions have provoked God's judgment. In the biblical narrative, God opposes nations and individuals who act in pride, idolatry, or injustice. Tyre's self-sufficiency and arrogance, as well as its role in opposing Israel, are likely reasons for this divine stance. This phrase echoes other instances in scripture where God declares Himself against those who defy His will (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>).<p><b>and I will raise up many nations against you,</b><br>The imagery of multiple nations coming against Tyre suggests a comprehensive and overwhelming judgment. Historically, Tyre faced sieges from various empires, including the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar and later the Greeks under Alexander the Great. This phrase can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, where God uses other nations as instruments of His judgment. It also reflects the biblical theme of God controlling the rise and fall of nations (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><b>as the sea brings up its waves.</b><br>The metaphor of the sea and its waves is particularly apt for Tyre, given its coastal location and dependence on maritime trade. Waves are relentless and powerful, symbolizing the unstoppable nature of the coming judgment. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical motif of chaos and judgment associated with the sea (e.g., <a href="/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3-4</a>). The use of natural imagery to describe divine action is common in prophetic literature, emphasizing God's control over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
