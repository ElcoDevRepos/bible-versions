In the context of Ezekiel, it underscores the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for God, receiving and conveying His messages to the people. This is a common introduction in prophetic literature, emphasizing the authority and divine origin of the message. It parallels similar introductions in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>, where the prophets receive direct communication from God.<p><b>came to me</b><br>The personal nature of this phrase highlights Ezekiel's unique calling and relationship with God. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet during the Babylonian exile, often received visions and messages while in captivity. This personal reception of God's word underscores the intimate and direct communication between God and His chosen prophets. It also reflects the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where God continued to speak to His people through prophets like Ezekiel, despite their displacement from the Promised Land.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This introduces the specific content of God's message. In the broader context of <a href="/ezekiel/11.htm">Ezekiel 11</a>, the message addresses the remnant of Israel and the promise of restoration. The use of "saying" prepares the reader for a direct quotation from God, emphasizing the importance and immediacy of the forthcoming divine communication. This structure is consistent with other prophetic declarations, where the prophet acts as a conduit for God's words, ensuring that the message is delivered accurately and authoritatively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's messages and visions.
