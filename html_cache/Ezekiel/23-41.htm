In the ancient Near East, couches were often used in banquets and gatherings, signifying a place of honor and relaxation. This imagery reflects the spiritual adultery of God's people, who were seduced by the allure of foreign gods and customs, abandoning their covenant with Yahweh. The couch of luxury contrasts with the humility and simplicity expected of God's people, as seen in the life of Jesus, who had "nowhere to lay his head" (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>with a table spread before it</b><br>The table represents abundance and provision, often associated with feasting and celebration. In biblical times, a table spread with food and drink was a sign of hospitality and fellowship. However, in this context, it underscores the idolatrous feasts and rituals that Israel engaged in with other nations. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where God prepares a table for the psalmist, symbolizing divine provision and blessing. Here, the table is a perversion of that divine fellowship, as it is used for idolatrous purposes.<p><b>on which you had set My incense and My oil</b><br>Incense and oil were significant in Israelite worship, used in the tabernacle and temple rituals as offerings to God (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>, <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). They symbolize prayer, worship, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. By setting God's incense and oil on a table of idolatry, Israel profaned what was holy, using sacred items in pagan practices. This act of desecration highlights the depth of their unfaithfulness. The misuse of these elements contrasts with their intended purpose, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>, where incense represents the prayers of the saints. This phrase serves as a warning against the corruption of true worship and the blending of sacred with profane.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively.
