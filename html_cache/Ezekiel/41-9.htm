In ancient Near Eastern architecture, thick walls were often used for fortification and to signify the strength and permanence of a building. This detail underscores the temple's role as a secure and holy place for worship. The number five in biblical numerology can symbolize God's grace, which may suggest the protective grace surrounding the temple.<p><b>and the open area between the side rooms of the temple</b><br>The open area, or space, between the side rooms likely served practical and symbolic purposes. Practically, it allowed for movement and access around the temple, facilitating the work of the priests and the maintenance of the temple. Symbolically, open spaces in temple architecture often represented the separation between the holy and the common, emphasizing the sanctity of the temple's inner areas. This separation can be seen as a type of the separation between God and humanity, which is ultimately bridged by Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple in the New Testament (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).
