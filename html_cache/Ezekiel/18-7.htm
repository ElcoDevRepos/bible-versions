In the context of ancient Israel, oppression often involved exploiting the poor or vulnerable, contrary to the Mosaic Law, which called for justice and mercy (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21-24</a>). The prophets frequently condemned such behavior (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>). This reflects God's character, who is just and compassionate, and foreshadows Christ's teachings on loving one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>but restores the pledge to the debtor</b><br>In ancient times, a pledge was often a garment or item given as collateral for a loan (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>). Restoring the pledge signifies integrity and compassion, ensuring the debtor is not left without essential needs. This practice aligns with the law's spirit, which sought to protect the poor and maintain their dignity. It echoes the Jubilee principles of debt forgiveness and restoration (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<p><b>He does not commit robbery</b><br>This phrase underscores the prohibition against taking what belongs to others, a principle rooted in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). Robbery disrupts community harmony and violates God's law. The emphasis on not committing robbery highlights the call to live righteously and respect others' rights, reflecting the moral teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the heart's purity (<a href="/matthew/5-19.htm">Matthew 5:19</a>).<p><b>but gives his bread to the hungry</b><br>Providing for the needy is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting God's concern for the poor (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). This act of charity is a tangible expression of love and obedience to God's commands. It prefigures Christ's ministry, where He fed the hungry and taught His followers to do likewise (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>). The sharing of bread symbolizes fellowship and the breaking of barriers between people.<p><b>and covers the naked with clothing</b><br>Clothing the naked is an act of mercy and compassion, addressing basic human dignity. This action is part of the broader biblical call to care for the vulnerable (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>). It is a practical demonstration of faith and love, as seen in the teachings of Jesus, who identified with the needy (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>). This phrase also points to the spiritual covering provided by Christ's righteousness, clothing believers in His grace (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The garment which the debtor had pledged as a security was to be restored to him at night. Such a law implied, of course, the return of the pledge in the morning. It was probably often used by the debtor for his own fraudulent advantage, and it was a natural consequence that the creditor should be tempted to evade compliance with it.
