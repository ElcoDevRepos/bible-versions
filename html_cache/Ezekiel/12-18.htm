It is used over 90 times in the book of Ezekiel. The term "Son of man" is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently uses it to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and identification with humanity (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>eat your bread with trembling</b><br>Ezekiel is instructed to perform a symbolic act, eating bread with trembling, to represent the fear and anxiety that will come upon the people of Jerusalem due to the impending siege and destruction. This act serves as a prophetic sign to the exiles in Babylon, illustrating the dire circumstances that will befall those remaining in Jerusalem. The trembling signifies the terror and uncertainty of those who will face famine and hardship.<p><b>and drink your water with quivering and anxiety</b><br>The drinking of water with quivering and anxiety further emphasizes the distress and scarcity that will accompany the siege. Water, a basic necessity, will become a source of fear due to its limited availability. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic warnings about the consequences of disobedience to God (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>). The act is a vivid portrayal of the psychological and physical toll of the coming judgment, serving as a warning to the exiles and a call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

God often turns ordinary actions into prophetic signs (<a href="/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-10</a>).<p>- Bread points to basic provision. When provision itself becomes part of the sign, God is warning that even life&#8217;s necessities will soon be touched by judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with trembling</b><p>- Ezekiel must physically shake while eating. His visible fear preaches louder than words: judgment will be so severe that every bite will be taken in dread (<a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>).<p>- The trembling mirrors the panic promised in covenant curses: &#8220;You will find no repose&#8230;a trembling heart, failing eyes, and despairing soul&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-66</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>drink your water</b><p>- Water, as vital as bread, is also acted out. Earlier God had Ezekiel measure scarce water rations (<a href="/ezekiel/4-11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a>).<p>- The inclusion of water warns that siege conditions will make even something as common as a drink uncertain (<a href="/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with quivering and anxiety</b><p>- The prophet&#8217;s shaking foreshadows the terror gripping Jerusalem during Babylon&#8217;s siege (<a href="/ezekiel/12-19.htm">Ezekiel 12:19</a>).<p>- Jesus later described similar end-time dread: &#8220;People will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming on the earth&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>).<p>- Sin&#8217;s consequences reach mind and body: &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>), yet this terror is earned by persistent rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God turns Ezekiel into a living sermon. By eating and drinking in fearful agitation he previews the panic Judah will feel when Babylon surrounds the city, food is scarce, and hope seems lost. The sign is literal&#8212;Ezekiel really trembles&#8212;and symbolic, announcing real judgment for real sin. Yet even this warning is mercy: those who heed can still repent and find the Lord faithful to preserve and restore, just as He promised throughout the prophets.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Eat thy bread with quaking.--</span>This is another symbolical action, the meaning of which is immediately explained. The prophet is to eat and drink as men in the terror and distress of a siege.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eat thy bread with quaking,</span> etc. No special stress is to be laid on the fact that only bread and water are named. The prophet is not dwelling now on the scarcity of food in the besieged city, as he had done in <a href="/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-17</a>, but on the fear and terror which should haunt the lives of the besieged. Here again we can scarcely doubt that, as in ver. 11, Ezekiel was a sign to those among whom he lived. Outwardly and visibly he was seen after his strange flitting, cowering in a corner, as one hunted down and dreading pursuit, with every look and gesture of extremest terror. This was to be the portion of those who escaped and whose life was "given them for a prey." The strange act was to be explained to "the people of the land," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the exiles among whom Ezekiel lived. The short prediction ends with the usual formula. There is another interval, and then another inspiration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7717;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
