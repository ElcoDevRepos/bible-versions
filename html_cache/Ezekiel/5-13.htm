In the context of Ezekiel, God's anger is directed towards the Israelites due to their persistent idolatry and rebellion. The concept of divine anger is consistent throughout the Old Testament, where God's wrath is often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). The idea of God's anger being "spent" suggests a limit to His wrath, emphasizing His justice and mercy.<p><b>and I have vented My wrath against them</b><br>Here, the "venting" of wrath signifies the execution of divine judgment. This is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God's wrath is portrayed as a purifying force (<a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>). The historical context involves the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem, which served as the fulfillment of God's warnings through the prophets. This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the inevitable consequences of disobedience.<p><b>I will be appeased</b><br>The notion of God being "appeased" suggests a restoration of relationship after judgment. In the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, appeasement was often achieved through offerings (Leviticus 1-7). This phrase points to the ultimate reconciliation between God and His people, foreshadowing the atoning work of Christ, who satisfies divine justice and restores peace (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><b>And when I have spent My wrath on them</b><br>Repetition of the idea of God's wrath being "spent" emphasizes the thoroughness and finality of His judgment. It reassures that God's actions are not arbitrary but are measured and purposeful. This reflects the biblical principle that God's discipline is intended to lead to repentance and restoration (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>).<p><b>they will know that I, the LORD,</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose of God's judgment: to reveal His identity and sovereignty. Throughout Ezekiel, the recognition formula "they will know that I am the LORD" is used to affirm God's authority and faithfulness to His covenant (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7, 7</a>:4). It serves as a reminder that God's actions are ultimately aimed at bringing people back to a true understanding of Him.<p><b>in My zeal have spoken</b><br>God's "zeal" indicates His passionate commitment to His holiness and His people. This zeal is a driving force behind His actions, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). The phrase "have spoken" underscores the certainty and authority of God's word, which is irrevocable and powerful (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This reflects the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's message, affirming that God's declarations will come to pass.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The thought is that a righteous anger, like that of Jehovah, rests (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is quieted) when it has done its work, and that in this sense God is "comforted," either as rejoicing in the punishment of evil for its own sake (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>), or because the punishment does its work in leading men to repentance. Israel may be comforted, because God is comforted as he sees that his judgments have done their work, and that his wrath can find repose. <span class="cmt_word">Have spoken in my zeal</span>. The thought implied is that what is spoken in the earnest purpose of "zeal" will assuredly be carried into execution (comp. <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>). Men might deride the prophet's warning as an idle threat. It would prove itself to have come from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when My anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#183;p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
