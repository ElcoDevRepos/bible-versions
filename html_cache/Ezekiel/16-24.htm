These mounds, or "high places," were elevated sites where altars were erected for sacrifices to foreign gods, contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The act of building such a mound signifies a deliberate choice to engage in idolatry, reflecting a departure from the covenant relationship with God. In the historical context, these high places were common in Canaanite religion and were adopted by the Israelites, despite God's commands against them (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>and made yourself a lofty shrine</b><br>The term "lofty shrine" indicates a place of worship that is elevated, both physically and symbolically, suggesting pride and self-exaltation. These shrines were often adorned with elaborate decorations and were intended to attract worshippers. The construction of such shrines was a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase highlights the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they turned away from God to worship idols, paralleling the unfaithfulness depicted in <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>.<p><b>in every public square</b><br>The mention of "every public square" emphasizes the widespread nature of idolatry in Israel. Public squares were central locations in ancient cities, used for gatherings, markets, and social interactions. By placing shrines in these areas, idolatry became a public and communal activity, deeply ingrained in the social fabric of the nation. This widespread idolatry reflects the pervasive spiritual corruption and the extent to which the people had abandoned their covenant with God. The public nature of these shrines contrasts with the private and personal relationship God desired with His people, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The mound represents a man-made substitute for the altar God had prescribed, showing self-willed religion rather than obedient faith (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of approaching the Lord in humility, Jerusalem elevated her own creation, signaling pride and independence from divine authority (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made yourself a lofty shrine</b><p>&#8226;

Shrines on heights were commonly devoted to fertility gods; Jerusalem adopted those very patterns, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226;

Each phrase intensifies the charge: self-made religion, brazen visibility, and total saturation of community life.
