It is a reminder of the distinction between God and man, highlighting the humility and obedience required of Ezekiel. The term is also a messianic title used by Jesus in the New Testament, pointing to His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>when the people of Israel lived in their land</b><br>This refers to the period before the Babylonian exile when Israel occupied the Promised Land. The land was a gift from God, a fulfillment of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was a place where they were to live in obedience to God's laws, reflecting His holiness to the nations around them.<p><b>they defiled it by their own ways and deeds</b><br>The Israelites' actions polluted the land, violating the covenant relationship with God. Their idolatry, injustice, and immorality were contrary to the laws given through Moses. This defilement led to the land "vomiting out" its inhabitants, as warned in <a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>. The concept of defilement underscores the seriousness of sin and its consequences.<p><b>Their behavior before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman&#8217;s impurity</b><br>This simile draws from Levitical laws regarding ritual purity (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24</a>). Just as a woman's menstrual impurity required separation and cleansing, so Israel's sins necessitated divine judgment and purification. The comparison emphasizes the offensiveness of their sin in God's sight and the need for repentance and restoration. This imagery also foreshadows the cleansing work of Christ, who purifies His people from all sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

God, calling the prophet &#8220;son of man,&#8221; recounts how His people, once securely planted in their land, corrupted it through ungodly attitudes and actions. Their defilement was so pervasive that He likens it to ceremonial uncleanness, rendering them unfit for worship. The verse exposes the seriousness of sin, the holiness of God, and sets the stage for the cleansing and renewal only He can provide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They defiled it.--</span>In <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-17.htm" title="Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelled in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.">Ezekiel 36:17-20</a> the sin of Israel in the past is set forth as the reason of their present condition.
