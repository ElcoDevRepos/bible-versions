The Law of Moses prohibited usury among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>). This prohibition was intended to promote social justice and prevent the exploitation of the poor. Usury, or charging excessive interest, was seen as a form of greed and exploitation, contrary to the communal and covenantal values of Israel. The prophets often condemned such practices as part of their broader critique of social injustice (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>, <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>).<p><b>Will this son live?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the seriousness of the sin and the inevitable consequence of death for those who engage in such practices. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>, the prophet is addressing the concept of individual responsibility. The question underscores the principle that each person is accountable for their own actions, rather than being judged for the sins of their ancestors. This was a significant shift from the prevailing belief in collective punishment, as seen in the proverb "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge" (<a href="/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>).<p><b>He will not!</b><br>The emphatic response highlights the certainty of divine justice. In the context of Ezekiel's message, it serves as a warning to the people of Judah that God will not overlook sin, regardless of one's heritage or family background. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is just and will not allow sin to go unpunished (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29-30</a>).<p><b>Since he has committed all these abominations,</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to actions that are detestable in the sight of God. In the Old Testament, this term is often used to describe idolatry, sexual immorality, and other grave sins (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). Ezekiel's use of the term underscores the severity of the sins being addressed, which include not only usury but also other violations of God's law. The cumulative nature of these sins indicates a lifestyle of rebellion against God.<p><b>he will surely die;</b><br>This phrase reiterates the certainty of the consequence for sin, which is death. In the Old Testament, death is often seen as the ultimate penalty for sin (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Ezekiel's message is clear: persistent sin without repentance leads to spiritual and physical death. This serves as a call to repentance and a return to righteousness.<p><b>his blood will be on his own head.</b><br>This expression signifies personal responsibility for one's actions. In biblical terms, having one's blood on their own head means bearing the guilt and consequences of their sin (<a href="/joshua/2-19.htm">Joshua 2:19</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a>). It emphasizes the principle of individual accountability before God, a key theme in <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>. This principle is consistent with the New Testament teaching that each person will be judged according to their deeds (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, who were in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and cannot blame others for their sins.
