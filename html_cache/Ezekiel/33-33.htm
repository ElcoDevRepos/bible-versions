In the context of Ezekiel, God had been warning the Israelites of impending judgment due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. The phrase underscores the inevitability of God's word coming to fruition, reflecting the biblical principle that God's promises and warnings are always fulfilled (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and surely it will come&#8212;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the assurance of the prophecy's fulfillment. This reflects the nature of biblical prophecy, where God's declarations are not mere possibilities but certainties. The historical context here is the Babylonian exile, a period when many Israelites doubted the words of the prophets. This assurance serves to remind them of God's sovereignty and the reliability of His word.<p><b>then they will know that a prophet has been among them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the recognition of Ezekiel's role as a true prophet of God. In biblical times, prophets were often not recognized or heeded until their prophecies came to pass. This acknowledgment serves as a vindication of Ezekiel's ministry and a reminder of the consequences of ignoring God's messengers. It also points to the broader biblical theme of recognizing God's voice through His appointed servants (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>). The phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also not fully recognized by His people during His earthly ministry but was later acknowledged through His resurrection and the fulfillment of His teachings (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

That was the prophet's message of judgment, his call to repentance. When the judgment should come, as it surely would, then they would know, in the bitterness of self-condemnation, that they had been listening, not to a hireling singer, but to a prophet of Jehovah. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So when it comes to pass&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it will come&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">then they will know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5030.htm">Strong's 5030: </a> </span><span class="str2">A spokesman, speaker, prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has been</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among them.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8432.htm">Strong's 8432: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bisection, the centre</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 33:33 When this comes to pass behold it (Ezek.
