The sound of the horn in this context is a warning of approaching judgment or attack. Biblically, the horn is often associated with divine intervention or communication (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>). The act of hearing implies that the message is accessible and clear, leaving the listener without excuse.<p><b>but fails to heed the warning</b><br>To heed means to pay attention and act accordingly. In the biblical context, failing to heed a warning from God or His appointed watchmen is a serious matter, often leading to dire consequences. This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability. The warning is not just a suggestion but a call to action, reflecting the urgency and seriousness of the situation. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-33</a>, where ignoring wisdom leads to calamity.<p><b>and the sword comes and takes him away</b><br>The sword is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and destruction. In Ezekiel's time, it often referred to the threat of military invasion or divine retribution. The imagery of the sword coming and taking someone away underscores the inevitability and severity of the consequences for ignoring the warning. This phrase connects to the broader theme of divine justice found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>, where authorities are described as God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.<p><b>his blood will be on his own head</b><br>This phrase signifies personal culpability and the concept of bloodguilt. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, blood was seen as the life force, and to have one's blood on one's own head meant bearing full responsibility for one's death. This idea is consistent with the biblical principle of individual accountability before God, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>.
