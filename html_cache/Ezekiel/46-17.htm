The inheritance refers to the land or property allotted to the prince, a leader or ruler, in the context of Ezekiel's vision of the restored temple and land. The giving of gifts to servants reflects the social hierarchy and the relationship between a master and his servants. Biblically, inheritance is a significant theme, often symbolizing God's promises and blessings to His people, as seen in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 13-21).<p><b>it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom</b><br>The "year of freedom" likely refers to the Year of Jubilee, a time prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10-13</a> when all debts were forgiven, and land was returned to its original owners. This practice ensured that no family in Israel would permanently lose their inheritance, reflecting God's provision and mercy. The Jubilee year was a time of liberation and restoration, symbolizing spiritual renewal and foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Christ.<p><b>then it will revert to the prince</b><br>This clause indicates that the gift given to the servant is temporary, emphasizing the principle that the land ultimately belongs to the original family or, in this case, the prince. This reversion underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of the tribal and familial inheritance, a concept deeply rooted in Israelite law and culture. It also highlights the temporary nature of earthly possessions and the enduring nature of God's promises.<p><b>His inheritance belongs only to his sons</b><br>The inheritance being reserved for the prince's sons underscores the patrilineal system of inheritance in ancient Israel, where property and titles were passed down through male descendants. This practice ensured the continuity of family lineage and the preservation of tribal identity. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of the inheritance believers receive through Christ, as sons and daughters of God (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><b>it shall be theirs</b><br>The final phrase reaffirms the permanence of the inheritance for the prince's sons, emphasizing the stability and continuity of God's covenant promises. This assurance of inheritance can be seen as a reflection of the eternal inheritance promised to believers in the New Testament, where through faith in Christ, they become heirs of God's kingdom (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11-14</a>).

Even a prince, therefore, may only make a conditional grant.<p>&#8226; The Lord allows generosity to household servants, echoing earlier provisions where masters supplied departing servants liberally (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the text immediately signals that this generosity is limited in duration, maintaining God&#8217;s design for permanent family allotments (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will belong to that servant until the year of freedom</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Year of freedom&#8221; points to the Jubilee pattern when liberty was proclaimed throughout the land (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<p>&#8226; During that season, all temporary transfers reset; God restores original order.<p>&#8226; The inclusion of Jubilee principles in a future setting underscores their ongoing validity and God&#8217;s heart for release, rest, and restorative justice (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1&#8211;2</a>, cited by Jesus in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant enjoys real possession&#8212;yet always under God&#8217;s timetable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then it will revert to the prince</b><p>&#8226; Reversion safeguards the lineage property assigned to the prince, just as tribal lands returned to their clans in ancient Israel (<a href="/leviticus/25-28.htm">Leviticus 25:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This prevents permanent alienation of covenant inheritance, shielding families from losing their God-given heritage (<a href="/1_kings/21-3.htm">1 Kings 21:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The mechanism balances mercy toward servants with fidelity to God&#8217;s covenant structure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His inheritance belongs only to his sons</b><p>&#8226; The prince&#8217;s parcel is hereditary, following the same principle by which the tribes&#8217; land remained within familial lines (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Sons here indicates legal heirs, ensuring stability of leadership and continuity of worship practices tied to the royal estate (<a href="/ezekiel/45-16.htm">Ezekiel 45:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors family order and promises extending &#8220;to a thousand generations&#8221; of those who love Him (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It shall be theirs</b><p>&#8226; Final affirmation: the sons&#8217; claim is permanent, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve covenant blessings (<a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>).<p>&#8226; No outside claim or servant&#8217;s temporary tenure can override the divine decree concerning rightful ownership.<p>&#8226; The verse thus weaves together stewardship, generosity, justice, and enduring promise&#8212;hallmarks of God&#8217;s kingdom economy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-17.htm">Ezekiel 46:17</a> teaches that the future prince may show benevolence by granting land to servants, yet God&#8217;s Jubilee principle limits such transfers to preserve the prince&#8217;s hereditary estate for his sons.
