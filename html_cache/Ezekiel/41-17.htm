The "inner sanctuary" is often understood as the Most Holy Place, a sacred area where God's presence was believed to dwell. The emphasis on the space above the entrance highlights the importance of the temple's structure and its symbolic representation of divine order and holiness. This mirrors the design of Solomon's Temple, where the Most Holy Place was the innermost and most sacred part (<a href="/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-20</a>).<p><b>on all the walls</b><br>The mention of "all the walls" suggests a comprehensive and detailed decoration or design, indicating the thoroughness and precision in the construction of the temple. This reflects the meticulous nature of God's instructions for sacred spaces, as seen in the detailed descriptions of the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>. The walls' adornment may symbolize the encompassing presence of God and His holiness surrounding His people.<p><b>spaced evenly around the inner and outer sanctuary</b><br>The phrase "spaced evenly" implies order and symmetry, which are significant in biblical architecture as they reflect divine perfection and harmony. The "inner and outer sanctuary" distinction indicates different levels of access and holiness, with the inner sanctuary being more sacred. This separation is reminiscent of the tabernacle and temple layouts, where only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place once a year (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>). The even spacing may also symbolize the orderly nature of God's creation and His desire for balance and justice in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
