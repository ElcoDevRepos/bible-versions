Ezekiel falls back upon the thought of <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, but the image is expanded with characteristic fullness. The function of the watchman, in which he sees a parable of his own office, is to stand upon his tower (<a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24, 25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), to keep his eye on the distant horizon, and as soon as the clouds of dust or the gleam of armor gives notice of the approach of the enemy, to sound the trumpet of alarm (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>), that men may not be taken unawares. If he discharge that duty faithfully, then, as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-21</a>, the blood of those that perish through their own negligence shall rest on their own head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
