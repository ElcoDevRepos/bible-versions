Ezekiel often receives visions and messages directly from God, highlighting his role as a prophet and intermediary between God and the people of Israel.<p><b>This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering</b><br>The guilt offering and sin offering were essential components of the sacrificial system in ancient Israel, as outlined in Leviticus. These offerings were made to atone for specific sins and unintentional transgressions. The mention of priests boiling these offerings underscores their role as mediators between God and the people, ensuring that the sacrificial rituals were conducted according to divine law. The specific location for boiling these offerings within the temple complex signifies the importance of maintaining ritual purity and order.<p><b>and where they shall bake the grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, also known as the meal offering, was a voluntary act of worship and devotion, often accompanying other sacrifices. It symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God. The baking of the grain offering in a designated area within the temple precincts reflects the structured and sacred nature of worship practices, ensuring that offerings were prepared in a manner befitting their holy purpose.<p><b>so that they do not bring them into the outer court</b><br>The outer court of the temple was accessible to the general populace, unlike the inner areas reserved for priests. By keeping the preparation of offerings within specific areas, the text emphasizes the separation between the sacred and the common. This separation was crucial in maintaining the sanctity of the temple and preventing the profanation of holy rituals by unintentional contact with the laity.<p><b>and transmit holiness to the people</b><br>Holiness, in the biblical sense, involves being set apart for God's purposes. The concern here is that the holiness associated with the offerings could be improperly transferred to the people, which could lead to unintended consequences or ritual impurity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for careful observance of His commands to maintain the sanctity of worship and community life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, who received visions and messages from God concerning the future of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The sacred place of worship for the Israelites, central to their religious life and practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering_and_sin_offering.htm">Guilt Offering and Sin Offering</a></b><br>Sacrifices prescribed in the Law of Moses for atonement of sins and guilt, symbolizing repentance and reconciliation with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/outer_court.htm">Outer Court</a></b><br>The area of the temple accessible to the people, distinct from the inner areas reserved for priests and sacred rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining holiness and separation in worship practices.

The reason given for not bearing the flesh of the sin and trespass offering into the outer court is, lest they should thereby "sanctify the people," and the same reason is given in <a href="/ezekiel/44-19.htm" title="And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.">Ezekiel 44:19</a> for not allowing the priests' garments to come into the outer court. Under the law all those offerings which it was the duty of the priests to consume are called "most holy," and whoever touched them or the sacred vessels of the sanctuary became "holy" in the sense of set apart to God (<a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>; also <a href="/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a>). The object of the command is therefore to prevent that ceremonial sanctification of the people which would interfere with their ordinary life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The "place" was designed as a kitchen where the priests should boil the trespass and the sin offerings and bake the meat (or, meal) offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cook the portions of the sacrifices they should eat in their official capacity (see <a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>).

To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), and accordingly he connects the words.
