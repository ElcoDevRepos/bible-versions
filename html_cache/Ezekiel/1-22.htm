The imagery of the living creatures is reminiscent of the cherubim in the tabernacle and temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness. The positioning "above the heads" signifies a separation between the divine and the created beings, emphasizing God's transcendence. This mirrors the separation seen in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>, where God creates the firmament to divide the waters, symbolizing order and structure in creation.<p><b>was the likeness of an awesome expanse</b><br>The term "likeness" suggests a vision or representation rather than a physical reality, indicating the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's experience. The "awesome expanse" conveys a sense of majesty and awe, reflecting the glory and sovereignty of God. This expanse can be compared to the "sea of glass" in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, which also signifies purity and the divine presence. The use of "awesome" underscores the overwhelming and majestic nature of God's throne room, a common theme in prophetic literature.<p><b>gleaming like crystal</b><br>The description "gleaming like crystal" highlights the purity, clarity, and brilliance of the expanse, symbolizing the holiness and perfection of God. Crystal, known for its transparency and beauty, serves as a metaphor for the divine nature, which is both awe-inspiring and incomprehensible. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described with similar brilliance, pointing to the ultimate revelation of God's glory. The use of crystal also suggests the idea of light and illumination, themes often associated with divine revelation and truth in scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Just as that firmament separated waters and displayed His majesty, this heavenly platform separates God&#8217;s throne from created beings, emphasizing His holiness (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Its &#8220;likeness&#8221; signals a reality beyond earthly categories, yet Ezekiel describes it literally as something he truly saw (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2&#8211;4</a> where Paul also struggles for earthly language).<p>&#8226; John witnesses a similar scene: &#8220;Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, clear as crystal&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gleaming like crystal</b><p>Finally, the expanse was &#8220;gleaming like crystal.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Crystal conveys purity, transparency, and unapproachable light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a> asks, &#8220;Can you, like Him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror?&#8221;&#8212;another image of a radiant, glass-like heaven.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a> records elders seeing &#8220;under His feet a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself,&#8221; paralleling the brilliance Ezekiel saw.<p>&#8226; Revelation repeats the theme: the New Jerusalem&#8217;s glory is &#8220;like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>), and the river of life is &#8220;clear as crystal&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ezekiel literally witnessed the throne room of God.

The scene proclaims His transcendence, purity, and sovereign rule, a vision echoed throughout Scripture to remind believers that the God who dwells in unapproachable light is also the One who rules all creation with flawless holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The likeness of the firmament.--</span>The word rendered "firmament" has undoubtedly originated, etymologically, from a verb originally signifying <span class= "ital">to beat out, </span>as in the case of metals; but the derivative word, in its use in connection with the heavens, had wholly lost this reference, and had come to mean simply an <span class= "ital">expanse. </span>The Hebrews do not appear to have ever entertained the classical idea of the sky as a metallic vault, the only passage seeming to indicate such a notion (<a href="/job/37-18.htm" title="Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?">Job 37:18</a>) being capable of quite a different explanation. We are here to conceive, therefore, of that which was "stretched forth over their heads above" as a simple expanse, like the sky, as if he had said, "And above their heads was stretched forth the sky." This expanse is not represented as supported by the cherubim, or resting upon them, and it remained undisturbed when they let down their wings (<a href="/ezekiel/1-25.htm" title="And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:25</a>). It was simply "stretched forth over their heads," at once separating them from, and yet uniting them with, the throne above. It fulfils, therefore, the complementary part to the wheels. They connected the vision with the earth; this connects it with God.<p><span class= "bld">The colour of the terrible crystal</span>--The expression "crystal" is doubtless derived from <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, as in turn it became the foundation for <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>. Yet it is not here any particular crystal; the word is Merely used to convey some idea of the appearance of the expanse beneath the throne, clear as crystal, terrible in its dazzling brightness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the likeness of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">firmament</span>, etc. The word is the same as that in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>; cf. 1; <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>. It meets us again in vers. 23, 25, 26, and in 10:1, but does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. What met the prophet's eye was the expanse, the "body of heaven in its clearness" (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>), the deep intense blue of an Eastern sky. <span class="cmt_word">Like the colour of the terrible crystal,</span> etc. The Hebrew noun is not found elsewhere. Its primary meaning, like that of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is that of "cold," and I incline therefore to the margin of the Revised Version, "ice." Rock crystal, seen, as it is, in small masses, and in its pure colourless transparency, hardly suggests the idea of terror; but the intense brightness of masses of ice, as shining in the morning sun, might well make that impression. Had Ezekiel seen the glories of a mountain throne of ice as he looked up, on his nay from Palestine to Chaldea, at the heights of Lebanon, or Hermon, and thought of them as the fitting symbol of the throne of God?
