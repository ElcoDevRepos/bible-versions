The use of "Lord GOD" emphasizes the sovereignty and covenantal relationship God has with Jerusalem. Jerusalem is personified, highlighting the intimate and personal nature of God's communication. This sets the stage for a prophetic message that is both corrective and redemptive.<p><b>Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites:</b><br>This phrase points to the historical and geographical context of Jerusalem. The Canaanites were the original inhabitants of the land before the Israelites. This reference serves as a reminder of the pagan and idolatrous roots from which God called His people. It underscores the transformation God intended for Israel, from a land of spiritual darkness to one of divine light.<p><b>Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite:</b><br>The Amorites and Hittites were prominent Canaanite tribes known for their idolatry and moral corruption. By using this imagery, the text highlights the spiritual heritage of Jerusalem, emphasizing its humble and sinful beginnings.
