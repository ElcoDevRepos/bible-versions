The River Kebar is a canal near Babylon, where Ezekiel received his initial vision. This location is significant as it represents the place of exile for the Israelites, highlighting God's presence even in foreign lands. The repetition of the vision emphasizes the consistency and reliability of God's revelation to Ezekiel. The faces symbolize various attributes of God: humanity (intelligence), lion (royalty and strength), ox (service and power), and eagle (sovereignty and swiftness). These creatures are often associated with the cherubim, angelic beings that serve as guardians of God's holiness, seen also in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>.<p><b>Each creature went straight ahead.</b><br>This phrase indicates the purposeful and unwavering movement of the creatures, symbolizing the direct and determined execution of God's will. The creatures' ability to move straight ahead without turning reflects the divine guidance and the unchangeable nature of God's plans. This imagery is consistent with the vision in <a href="/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>, where the creatures move in any direction the Spirit would go, signifying obedience and alignment with God's Spirit. The straight movement can also be seen as a metaphor for the righteous path that believers are called to follow, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>, where the path of the righteous is described as straight and unwavering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, depicted with multiple faces and wings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/river_kebar.htm">River Kebar</a></b><br>A location in Babylon where Ezekiel received several visions, including the initial vision of the cherubim.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_god's_glory.htm">Vision of God's Glory</a></b><br>This chapter is part of a larger vision where Ezekiel sees the glory of God departing from the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time when the Israelites were in captivity in Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_holiness.htm">Understanding God's Holiness</a></b><br>The cherubim's presence signifies the holiness and majesty of God.

The word &#8220;faces&#8221; points back to the detailed description in <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, where each creature bore four distinct faces&#8212;human, lion, ox, and eagle&#8212;each displaying an aspect of God&#8217;s character (see also <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, where similar living creatures surround God&#8217;s throne).<p>&#8226; By noting the similarity, Ezekiel affirms that the beings he sees now are the same heavenly beings he met earlier, underscoring the consistency of God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness has not changed between the riverbank vision and the temple vision. The same glorious beings who upheld His throne by the River Kebar now accompany His glory departing from the profaned temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the faces I had seen</b><p>&#8226; This is Ezekiel&#8217;s personal testimony. He is an eyewitness, echoing the pattern of Scripture where prophets and apostles testify to what they have &#8220;seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition establishes credibility (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>). By saying he saw the same faces, Ezekiel confirms the divine origin of both visions.<p>&#8226; The matching faces link God&#8217;s glory both to Israel&#8217;s exile and to Jerusalem&#8217;s impending judgment. The God who met His prophet among the exiles is the same God judging the city&#8212;they cannot escape His presence (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the River Kebar</b><p>&#8226; The River Kebar was located in Babylonia, far from Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>). Mentioning it reminds the reader that God&#8217;s glory is not confined to geographic Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The exile had seemed like separation from God, yet the initial Kebar vision proved He was already with His people in captivity. Now, as His glory prepares to leave the temple, the reference to Kebar highlights that His presence goes with the faithful remnant rather than remaining with an unrepentant nation (<a href="/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; God is sovereign over all lands, accomplishing His purposes in both judgment and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each creature went straight ahead</b><p>&#8226; The phrase echoes <a href="/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>: &#8220;Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the Spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Going &#8220;straight ahead&#8221; illustrates perfect obedience to the Spirit&#8217;s direction. The cherubim do not hesitate or wander; their movement is unhindered and purposeful (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; This direct motion signifies the unstoppable advance of God&#8217;s plan. Judgment on Jerusalem will proceed exactly as decreed, just as future restoration will come in His appointed time (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the unwavering course of the cherubim encourages us to follow God&#8217;s leading without deviation (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/10-22.htm">Ezekiel 10:22</a> anchors the temple vision to the earlier Kebar encounter, proving that the same holy God who accompanied the exiles now oversees judgment in Jerusalem. The identical faces affirm the continuity of His glory, while the straight-ahead motion of the cherubim demonstrates their flawless obedience and the certainty of God&#8217;s unfolding plan. In every setting&#8212;exile or homeland&#8212;He remains present, sovereign, and true to His word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/10-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their faces</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
