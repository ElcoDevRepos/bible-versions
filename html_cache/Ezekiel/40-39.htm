This vision is part of a larger prophetic revelation given to Ezekiel concerning a future temple. The gateway signifies a place of transition from the outer courts to the inner sacred areas, symbolizing the movement from the secular to the holy. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, gateways often served as places of judgment or decision, reflecting the spiritual significance of entering God's presence.<p><b>were two tables on each side</b><br>The presence of tables on each side of the gateway indicates preparation and order in the sacrificial system. These tables were likely made of stone, as suggested by archaeological findings of similar structures in ancient temples. The number two may symbolize witness or testimony, as seen in other biblical contexts where two witnesses establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The tables' placement on each side suggests symmetry and balance, reflecting the orderliness of God's design.<p><b>on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings</b><br>These offerings were central to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, each serving a distinct purpose. Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God (Leviticus 1). Sin offerings were made for unintentional sins, emphasizing atonement and purification (Leviticus 4). Guilt offerings, or trespass offerings, addressed specific transgressions and required restitution (Leviticus 5). Together, these offerings highlight the comprehensive nature of atonement and reconciliation with God.<p><b>were to be slaughtered</b><br>The act of slaughtering the offerings was a critical component of the sacrificial process, signifying the seriousness of sin and the need for a substitute. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was "slain from the foundation of the world" (<a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>) and fulfilled the sacrificial system by offering Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).

The symmetry underscores divine order and completeness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). Their permanent construction signals the continuing importance of sacrifice in this millennial temple (<a href="/ezekiel/43-18.htm">Ezekiel 43:18&#8211;27</a>). The arrangement also assures every worshiper, no matter from which side he approaches, of equal opportunity for atonement (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3&#8211;34</a>, where tribes camped symmetrically around the tabernacle).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were to be slaughtered</b><p>Three distinct sacrifices are named, each with a unique emphasis drawn from Leviticus:<p>&#8226; Burnt offering (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3&#8211;17</a>) &#8211; the whole animal consumed, portraying total consecration to God (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin offering (<a href="/leviticus/4-1.htm">Leviticus 4:1&#8211;5</a>:13) &#8211; blood applied for purification from unintentional sin, highlighting the need for cleansing (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Guilt offering (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14&#8211;6</a>:7) &#8211; restitution-oriented, dealing with specific trespasses and restoring fellowship (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>; cf.

These were twelve in number, of which eight were used for slaughtering purposes, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either for slaying the sacrifices or for laying upon them the carcasses of the slaughtered victims; and the remaining four for depositing thereon the instruments employed in killing the animals.

This determines the gate in question to have been, not the north gate, as the Authorized Version has conjectured, but the east gate, whose side walls looked towards the north and south. The third quaternion of tables appears to have been planted at the steps, presumably two on' each side, i.e. if with Kliefoth, Keil, and Schroder, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> be translated "at the ascent," or "going up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the staircase (comp. ver. 26).

As they were designed for heavy instruments, they were constructed of hewn stones a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; from which it may be argued the eight previously mentioned were made of wood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Inside the portico</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;u&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
