The lifting by the Spirit signifies a supernatural experience, often associated with prophetic visions or revelations. In the context of Ezekiel, this lifting is both literal and symbolic, representing the elevation of the prophet to receive divine messages. Similar experiences are seen in the lives of other prophets, such as Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>), where the Spirit's involvement signifies divine authority and purpose.<p><b>and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me:</b><br>The "great rumbling sound" can be understood as a manifestation of God's presence, often associated with His glory and power. In biblical literature, such sounds accompany divine appearances, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> at Mount Sinai. The sound signifies the awe-inspiring and sometimes terrifying nature of God's presence. It also serves as a prelude to a significant revelation or event, emphasizing the seriousness and magnitude of what is to follow.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His dwelling place!&#8221;</b><br>This proclamation highlights the central theme of God's glory, which is a recurring motif in Ezekiel. The glory of the LORD refers to His manifest presence, often depicted as a radiant light or cloud. The phrase "in His dwelling place" suggests the temple or the heavenly realm where God's presence resides. This blessing acknowledges God's holiness and majesty, aligning with the worship and reverence due to Him. It echoes the doxologies found in Psalms (<a href="/psalms/72-19.htm">Psalm 72:19</a>) and Revelation (<a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>), where God's glory is celebrated universally.

So the vision that I had seen went up from me.">Ezekiel 11:24</a>. (Comp. <a href="/acts/8-39.htm" title="And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.">Acts 8:39</a>.) In the last case the "taking up" is expressly said to have been in vision. This closes one act, so to speak, of the prophet's consecration, and now the vision which he has been seeing all along leaves him for a time. He hears the great voice of ascription of praise, without definite mention of its source, but doubtless, as in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4, from all that surround the throne; and he hears the noise of the moving wings of the cherubim, and of the wheels. He has seen the representation of the glory of Him who sends him, and has heard the character of his message. He must now, in the light of this knowledge, see those to whom he is sent. The Hebrew for "wings that touched one another" is beautifully figurative: "wings that kissed each one its sister."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the Spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">took me up,</span> etc. The words are to be interpreted as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Luther, however, gives "a wind lifted me up." The parallels of <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> (where, however, we have the addition, "in the visions of God") and <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a> suggest the conclusion that this was a purely subjective sensation, that it was one of the phenomena of the ecstatic state, and that there was no actual change of place. On the other hand, the use of like language in the cases of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>), of our Lord (<a href="/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12</a>), of Philip (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), would justify the inference that the prophet actually passed from one locality to the other. The language of <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a> probably points to the true solution of the problem. The ecstatic state continued, and in it Ezekiel went from the banks of Chebar to the dwellings of the exiles at Tel-Abib (see note on ch. 1.), at some distance from it. <span class="cmt_word">I heard behind me,</span> etc. The words imply that the prophet, either in his vision or in very deed. had turned from the glory of the living creatures and of the wheels, and set his face in the direction in which he was told to go. As he does so, he hears the sounds of <span class="cmt_word">a great rushing</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Luther, "earthquake"), followed by words which, though in the form of a doxology, uttered, it may be presumed, by the living creatures, were also a message of encouragement. His readiness to do his work as a preacher of repentance calls forth the praise of God from those in whose presence there is "joy over one sinner that repenteth." We are reminded of the earthquake in the Mount of Purification and the <span class="accented">Gloria, in excelsis</span> of Dante ('Purg.,' 20:127-141; 21:53-60).
