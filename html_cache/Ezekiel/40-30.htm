These structures provided shelter and a place for gathering. The inner court of the temple was a significant area, reserved for the priests and certain sacrificial activities. This reflects the holiness and separation inherent in the temple's design, emphasizing the sacredness of approaching God. The inner court's design can be seen as a type of the heavenly temple, where only those made holy through Christ can enter.<p><b>were twenty-five cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, twenty-five cubits would be approximately 37.5 feet or 11.25 meters. The specific dimensions highlight the precision and orderliness of God's design for His dwelling place, reflecting His nature. This measurement also connects to the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle and Solomon's temple, underscoring the continuity of God's plan and presence among His people.<p><b>and five cubits deep</b><br>The depth of five cubits, about 7.5 feet or 2.25 meters, indicates the substantial nature of these porticoes. This depth provided adequate space for movement and gathering, facilitating the temple's function as a place of worship and community. The number five in biblical numerology often symbolizes grace, suggesting that the temple's design was not only about structure but also about the grace extended to those who come to worship. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the grace offered through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate temple and mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_vision.htm">The Temple Vision</a></b><br>This vision, given to Ezekiel, describes a future temple with precise measurements and structures, symbolizing God's presence and order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/porticoes.htm">Porticoes</a></b><br>Architectural elements of the temple, these are covered walkways or porches, indicating a place of transition and entry into sacred space.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The context of Ezekiel's prophecy, where the Israelites are in Babylon, longing for restoration and the return of God's presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_measuring_angel.htm">The Measuring Angel</a></b><br>A figure in Ezekiel's vision who guides him through the temple, emphasizing the divine precision and order of God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_precision.htm">Divine Order and Precision</a></b><br>God's plans are detailed and precise, reflecting His nature of order and purpose.

This statement occurs nowhere else in the description of the gates, and the verse is omitted in the Greek translation, and either considered spurious or else passed over in silence by many commentators. One explanation given is that the twenty-five cubits is the sum-total of all the "projections of the walls" into the interior of the gateway. thus there were two "spaces" (S on the plan [<a href="/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]), each of five cubits; two thresholds (TT? [<a href="/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]), each of six cubits; and two walls of the porch, each of one cubit, or in all (5 ? 2+6 ? 2 + 2) twenty-four cubits, the remaining cubit being made up by mouldings at the angles of these several projections. But it is fatal to this explanation that in no other case is any measurement thus made up by adding together the details of parts which do not adjoin. The same explanation requires the breadth of five cubits to be the transverse measurement of these projecting parts, which certainly could not apply to the first threshold, and would require a very awkward or even impossible narrowing of the gateway where the "spaces" are placed. The true solution of the difficulty seems to be in a slight change in the vowels of the Masoretic punctuation, which will transform the word into "porch." That porches were connected with the inner gates also is plain from <a href="/ezekiel/40-39.htm" title="And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.">Ezekiel 40:39</a>, yet they are nowhere mentioned in the description unless here. Being a somewhat independent part of the gate, the measures are taken in a different direction from that of the gate itself. The "length" is the long way of the porch, just as long as the gateway is wide, twenty-five cubits; and the breadth is the measurement between the walls, five cubits, thus allowing a half-cubit for the thickness of each wall, and one cubit less clear space than in the outer gates.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(There were porticoes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;lam&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_361.htm">Strong's 361: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pillar-space, a pale</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all around,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1489; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5439.htm">Strong's 5439: </a> </span><span class="str2">A circle, neighbour, environs, around</span><br /><br /><span class="word">twenty-five</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cubits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;am&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, a cubit, a door-base</span><br /><br /><span class="word">long</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_753.htm">Strong's 753: </a> </span><span class="str2">Length</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and five</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2568.htm">Strong's 2568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cubits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;am&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, a cubit, a door-base</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wide.)</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1495;&#1463;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7717;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7341.htm">Strong's 7341: </a> </span><span class="str2">Breadth, width</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/40-30.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 40:30 There were arches all around twenty-five cubits (Ezek.
