The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, often used to denote their spiritual state or rebellion.<p><b>&#8216;The vision that he sees is for many years from now;</b><br>The Israelites are dismissing Ezekiel's prophecies as irrelevant to their current situation, believing them to be about a distant future. This reflects a common human tendency to ignore warnings that do not seem immediate. It also shows a misunderstanding or denial of the urgency of God's messages.<p><b>he prophesies about the distant future.&#8217;</b><br>The people are skeptical of Ezekiel's prophecies, suggesting they are not applicable to their present circumstances. This skepticism is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where people often doubt the immediacy or relevance of God's warnings.

Like Daniel being called &#8220;son of man&#8221; in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a> and Christ using the title for Himself in <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>, the phrase stresses both humanity and divine commission. Here it underscores that the warning coming next is delivered by a man, yet carries divine authority that cannot be shrugged off.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>take note that the house of Israel is saying</b><p>The Lord tells Ezekiel to pay close attention to the murmuring of his audience. Their words reveal hearts hardened by unbelief&#8212;similar to the dismissive attitudes in <a href="/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a> (&#8220;They have lied about the LORD&#8221;) and <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> (people who say, &#8220;Do not prophesy to us what is right&#8221;). The people of Judah, still in Jerusalem and already in exile, prefer soothing messages. God wants His prophet to register the exact nature of their complaint so He can answer it directly. Their skepticism also foreshadows the &#8220;scoffers&#8221; Peter speaks of in <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3&#8211;4</a> who question the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;The vision that he sees is for many years from now;</b><p>They concede Ezekiel has visions, yet they push the fulfillment so far into the future that it loses all urgency. That attitude echoes <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a> (&#8220;You dismiss the day of calamity&#8221;) and <a href="/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a> (Hezekiah&#8217;s relief that judgment would come &#8220;in my days&#8221; rather than immediately). By redefining God&#8217;s imminent warnings as remote, the people justify ignoring repentance today&#8212;precisely the opposite of what the Lord desires. <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> counters their logic: &#8220;The vision awaits an appointed time&#8230; though it tarries, wait for it; it will surely come.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he prophesies about the distant future.&#8217;</b><p>Their final verdict: Ezekiel&#8217;s words concern an age so far off that contemporary listeners can remain unaffected. God immediately overturns this in the next verse (<a href="/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>), promising none of His words will be delayed any longer. When Jesus later weeps over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>), He illustrates the tragic outcome of ignoring a timely prophetic warning&#8212;judgment arrives suddenly. What seemed &#8220;distant&#8221; proves to be right at the door.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a> exposes a fatal excuse: treating God&#8217;s clear, literal warnings as remote speculation. The Lord reminds Ezekiel&#8212;and us&#8212;that when He speaks, fulfillment is certain and often nearer than people suppose. Scoffing delays may soothe the conscience, but they never postpone God&#8217;s timetable. Therefore, heed His Word today, repent without delay, and trust that every promise of Scripture will come to pass exactly as spoken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">take note</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;The vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;z&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
