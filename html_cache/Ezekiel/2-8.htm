It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>listen to what I tell you.</b><br>This command underscores the importance of obedience to God's word. In the context of Ezekiel's prophetic ministry, listening implies not just hearing but also understanding and acting upon God's instructions. This theme of obedience is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers.<p><b>Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house.</b><br>The "rebellious house" refers to the nation of Israel, which had consistently turned away from God's commandments. Historically, Israel's rebellion led to their exile and suffering. This warning to Ezekiel serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for faithfulness. The theme of rebellion and its consequences is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, seen in the narratives of the wilderness wanderings and the period of the judges.<p><b>Open your mouth and eat what I give you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase introduces the symbolic act of eating the scroll, which occurs in the following chapter. Eating the scroll represents internalizing God's message, making it a part of oneself. This act is similar to the experience of the Apostle John in <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>, where he also eats a scroll. It signifies the prophet's acceptance of his mission and the necessity of fully embracing God's word to proclaim it effectively. The imagery of eating God's word is a powerful metaphor for the sustenance and life that come from divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who commissions Ezekiel to speak to the rebellious Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The rebellious house referred to in the passage, representing the people of Israel who have turned away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel receives his prophetic call, as the Israelites are in captivity due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to listen and not rebel, highlighting the importance of obedience in our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/internalization_of_scripture.htm">Internalization of Scripture</a></b><br>The act of eating the scroll symbolizes taking God's word into our hearts and minds, making it a part of us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resistance_to_rebellion.htm">Resistance to Rebellion</a></b><br>The Israelites' rebellion serves as a warning against turning away from God's commands, urging us to remain faithful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_responsibility.htm">Prophetic Responsibility</a></b><br>Ezekiel's role underscores the responsibility of those who are called to speak God's truth, emphasizing the need for courage and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>God provides the message Ezekiel is to deliver, reminding us that He equips us for the tasks He assigns.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_2_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_Israel_s_rebellion_in_Ezekiel_2_8.htm">How can we avoid being "rebellious" like the house of Israel in Ezekiel 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_open_your_mouth_and_eat.htm">What does "open your mouth and eat" symbolize in Ezekiel 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ezekiel_2_8_to_John_1_14_s_Word.htm">How does Ezekiel 2:8 connect with Jesus as the Word in John 1:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_listen_in_Bible_study.htm">How can we apply the command to "listen" in our daily Bible study?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_internalize_God_s_Word_Ezekiel_2_8.htm">What steps can we take to internalize God's Word as instructed in Ezekiel 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_2_8_on_obeying_God_s_commands.htm">What does Ezekiel 2:8 reveal about obedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_2_8_Resisting_divine_guidance.htm">How does Ezekiel 2:8 challenge personal resistance to divine instruction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_eating_the_scroll_symbolic.htm">Why is the symbolism of eating the scroll significant in Ezekiel 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/ezekiel_2_8-10__how_is_eating_a_scroll_plausible.htm">Ezekiel 2:8&#8211;10: How do we reconcile the command to physically eat a scroll with scientific plausibility and the lack of mention of any lasting effects?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/escape_to_mountains_for_safety.htm">What signifies the Son of Man?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_codex_gigas.htm">What does the Bible say about watchmen?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_no_precedent_for_ezekiel_38's_attack.htm">If Ezekiel 38 describes events yet to come, why is there no clear archaeological or historical precedent for such a massive, unified attack on Israel?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 2:8 Mean</div><b>And you, son of man</b><p>God singles out Ezekiel personally.<p>&#8226;
