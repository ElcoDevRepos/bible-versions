In ancient Near Eastern cultures, shaving the head was often associated with mourning or pagan rituals. By prohibiting this, God sets His priests apart from such practices, underscoring their holiness and dedication to Him. This command aligns with the Nazarite vow in <a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>, where individuals dedicated to God also refrained from shaving their heads.<p><b>or let their hair grow long</b><br>Long hair in ancient Israel could symbolize neglect or rebellion, as seen in the story of Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25-26</a>). For priests, maintaining a moderate appearance was crucial to reflect order and discipline. This requirement ensured that priests did not adopt the customs of surrounding nations, where long hair might be associated with certain religious or cultural practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>but must carefully trim their hair</b><br>The instruction to trim their hair carefully indicates a balance between extremes, symbolizing self-control and propriety. This practice reflects the broader biblical principle of moderation and orderliness, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>, where Paul instructs the church to do everything decently and in order. The priests' appearance was a visible representation of their inner spiritual state and their commitment to serving God faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book that bears his name.

The prohibition of <a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm" title="Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.">Ezekiel 44:21</a> is given in <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm" title="Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:">Leviticus 10:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The next rubric concerned the mode in which the priests should wear their hair.

Ezekiel's raising the priesthood as a body to the rank of the high priest, of whom in connection with this temple is no trace, rather proves Ezekiel to have been later than Leviticus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1548.htm">Strong's 1548: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bald, to shave, to lay waste</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their heads</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or let their hair</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;e&#183;ra&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6545.htm">Strong's 6545: </a> </span><span class="str2">Long hair, locks</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grow long,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but must carefully trim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1505;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;s&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3697.htm">Strong's 3697: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shear, clip</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their hair.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/44-20.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 44:20 Neither shall they shave their heads (Ezek.
