This area was known for its trade routes and production of luxury goods, including wine. The mention of wine highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre, a major Phoenician city known for its commerce and wealth. Wine was a valuable commodity in the ancient world, often used in religious rituals and as a symbol of prosperity. The trade of wine from Izal underscores the economic reach and influence of Tyre, as well as the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations through trade.<p><b>Wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were exchanged for your merchandise.</b><br>Wrought iron refers to a form of iron that was worked into tools and weapons, indicating the advanced metallurgical skills of the time. Iron was a crucial material in the ancient world, used for both practical and military purposes. Cassia is a spice similar to cinnamon, valued for its aromatic properties and used in anointing oils and perfumes, as seen in <a href="/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>. Sweet cane, or calamus, was another aromatic plant used in incense and perfumes, highlighting the luxury and opulence associated with Tyre's trade. The exchange of these goods for Tyre's merchandise illustrates the city's role as a hub of luxury trade, dealing in items that were not only practical but also held cultural and religious significance.

Verse 19 sits in the middle of that list, highlighting how far-reaching Tyre&#8217;s trading partners were and how valuable the cargo was. The verse reads: &#8220;Dan and Javan paid for your wares with yarn from Uz; wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were exchanged for your merchandise.&#8221; The Holy Spirit catalogs specific goods to show the richness of Tyre&#8217;s commerce and, by contrast, the depth of its coming loss (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Casks of wine from Izal for your wares</b><p>&#8226; Wine (or &#8220;yarn,&#8221; depending on the textual tradition) is a luxury item, signaling prosperity (<a href="/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>; <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Izal&#8221; (also &#8220;Uzal,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/10-26.htm">Genesis 10:26-27</a>) was in southern Arabia, far from Tyre. The detail underscores Tyre&#8217;s global reach&#8212;people hundreds of miles away were eager to trade with her (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the origin of the wine, God reminds us that He observes every marketplace and every transaction (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Nothing escapes His notice, and no empire is self-sustaining.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wrought iron</b><p>&#8226; Iron was a strategic commodity for tools and weapons (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-21</a>). Its mention hints at Tyre&#8217;s military alliances and economic strength.<p>&#8226; Even iron, renowned for strength (<a href="/jeremiah/15-12.htm">Jeremiah 15:12</a>), cannot preserve a nation God has decreed to fall (<a href="/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Ezekiel 28:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows that Tyre profited not merely from luxuries but from the building blocks of empires&#8212;further reason her downfall would shock the world (<a href="/ezekiel/27-35.htm">Ezekiel 27:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cassia</b><p>&#8226; Cassia, a fragrant spice, formed part of the holy anointing oil (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>) and royal garments (<a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Its use points to worship and royalty, meaning Tyre trafficked in goods associated with the sacred and the elite.<p>&#8226; Yet the city&#8217;s heart was not set on the LORD; riches without obedience invite judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Ezekiel 28:5-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sweet cane were exchanged for your merchandise</b><p>&#8226; Sweet cane (calamus) provided perfume and incense (<a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>). Worshippers offered it in the temple, making it another item tied to spiritual devotion.<p>&#8226; Tyre treated what was meant for God&#8217;s glory as mere merchandise. This commercialization echoes Jesus&#8217; cleansing of the temple, where worship had become marketplace business (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning is clear: when the things of God become tools for profit, judgment follows (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a> paints Tyre as the ultimate global trader, importing luxury wine, strategic iron, fragrant cassia, and sweet cane. Each item highlights God&#8217;s blessing poured out on nations willing to seek Him&#8212;yet Tyre used that blessing for pride and gain, not worship and righteousness. The verse therefore serves as both a snapshot of ancient commerce and a timeless caution: wealth and influence apart from obedience end in ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Dan also and Javan.--</span>This is the only instance in this enumeration in which the name of a people is introduced with a conjunction. Besides this structural difficulty, there seems no appropriateness in the name Dan, a tribe of Israel long since carried into captivity. The city Dan was of quite too little prominence to be mentioned here. It is probable, therefore, that what our translators have taken for the conjunction is really a part of the name Vedan, a place in Arabia not elsewhere mentioned, but which some suppose to be Aden. Javan does not here stand for Greece, but for an Arabian place or tribe, which there is reason to think is Yemen.<p><span class= "bld">Going to</span> <span class= "bld">and fro.--</span>The margin is better, <span class= "ital">Menzal,</span> or rather--the first letter being a preposition--<span class= "ital">front Uzal,</span> the ancient Sanaa, afterwards the capital of Yemen.

The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, takes the first syllable as the common conjunction "and;" but no other verse in the chapter begins in this way, and the Revised Version is probably right in giving the Hebrew word as its stands. Dan, it may be added, was hardly likely to have been singled out of all the tribes after the mention of Judah and Israel, especially as it had shared in the exile of the ten tribes. Smend identifies it with <span class="accented">Waddan</span>, between Mecca and Medina, or with Aden.
