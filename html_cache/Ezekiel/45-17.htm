This role is distinct from the high priest, emphasizing a division of responsibilities in worship. The prince's duty to provide offerings highlights the importance of leadership in facilitating worship and maintaining the spiritual life of the community. Burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings were integral to Israelite worship, symbolizing dedication, sustenance, and joy before God. These offerings are reminiscent of the Levitical system outlined in Leviticus and Numbers, underscoring continuity in worship practices.<p><b>for the feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths</b><br>The mention of feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths indicates the cyclical nature of Israel's worship calendar. Feasts such as Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles were times of communal gathering and remembrance of God's acts in history. New Moons marked the beginning of each month, while Sabbaths were weekly days of rest and worship. These observances were central to Israel's identity and relationship with God, serving as reminders of His provision and covenant. The prince's involvement in these observances underscores the integration of civil and religious leadership.<p><b>for all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel</b><br>The phrase "appointed feasts" refers to the divinely instituted times of celebration and worship. These feasts were not merely cultural events but were commanded by God as part of His covenant with Israel. They served as times of reflection, thanksgiving, and renewal of the covenant relationship. The prince's role in providing for these feasts highlights the importance of ensuring that the community can fully participate in these sacred times, maintaining their connection to God and their heritage.<p><b>He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings</b><br>The provision of various offerings by the prince indicates a comprehensive approach to worship and atonement. Sin offerings were specifically for atonement and purification, addressing the people's transgressions. Grain offerings represented dedication and thanksgiving, while burnt offerings symbolized complete surrender to God. Peace offerings were expressions of fellowship and gratitude. This variety of offerings reflects the multifaceted nature of worship and the need for both individual and communal atonement and thanksgiving.<p><b>to make atonement for the house of Israel</b><br>Atonement is a central theme in the sacrificial system, signifying reconciliation between God and His people. The prince's role in making atonement emphasizes the need for leadership in guiding the nation towards spiritual renewal and purity. This anticipates the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the sacrificial system through His death and resurrection. The concept of atonement in Ezekiel points forward to the New Covenant, where Christ is both the High Priest and the perfect sacrifice, providing eternal reconciliation for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler in Israel responsible for providing offerings.

While the Messiah reigns as King of kings (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>), the prince manages temple worship on Israel&#8217;s behalf.
