It underscores the distinction between the divine message and the human messenger. The term "son of man" is also used extensively in the Book of Daniel and by Jesus in the New Testament, highlighting both humility and authority.<p><b>tell the ruler of Tyre</b><br>Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its wealth and maritime prowess. The ruler, likely King Ithobaal II during Ezekiel's time, is addressed directly. Tyre's economic success led to pride and a sense of invincibility. The city's strategic location and trade dominance are well-documented in ancient records.<p><b>that this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>This introduction affirms the divine origin of the message, emphasizing its authority. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) highlights God's sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel, contrasting with the pagan deities of Tyre.<p><b>Your heart is proud,</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in biblical texts, often leading to downfall. The ruler's pride is linked to his wealth and power, reminiscent of other biblical figures like Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride precedes destruction.<p><b>and you have said, &#8216;I am a god;</b><br>This claim of divinity reflects extreme arrogance and self-deception. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, rulers often associated themselves with gods, but this was a direct challenge to the monotheistic belief in the one true God. <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a> similarly describes the pride of Babylon's king.<p><b>I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea.&#8217;</b><br>Tyre's location on an island contributed to its perceived impregnability and divine status. The "seat of gods" implies a throne or place of authority, suggesting the ruler's belief in his own supremacy. The sea often symbolizes chaos and power in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>.<p><b>Yet you are a man and not a god,</b><br>This statement serves as a humbling reminder of the ruler's mortality and limitations. It echoes the biblical theme that no human can attain divine status, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>'s temptation and the Tower of Babel narrative in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>.<p><b>though you have regarded your heart as that of a god.</b><br>The ruler's self-perception is contrasted with reality. This delusion is a common human failing, as seen in the fall of Lucifer in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of will and emotion, highlighting the depth of the ruler's pride.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruler_of_tyre.htm">Ruler of Tyre</a></b><br>The leader of the city-state of Tyre, known for its wealth and strategic location.

The point of the charge is inordinate pride, begotten of great prosperity; this prosperity, being attributed to his own powers instead of to its true source, led him to imagine himself almost more than mortal.

We are reminded of Isaiah's words (Isaiah 14:13, 14) as to the King of Babylon.
