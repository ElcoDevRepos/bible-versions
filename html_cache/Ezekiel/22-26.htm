This phrase highlights the corruption and failure of the religious leaders in Jerusalem. The term "violence" suggests a deliberate and forceful breach of God's commandments, indicating a deep moral and spiritual decay. The priests' actions are a direct affront to the holiness of God, as they were entrusted with maintaining the sanctity of worship and the temple. This echoes the broader theme in Ezekiel of Israel's leaders failing in their duties, similar to the rebukes found in <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a> and <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7-8</a>.<p><b>They make no distinction between the holy and the common,</b><br>The priests' failure to differentiate between what is sacred and what is ordinary undermines the very foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God. This distinction was crucial in maintaining the purity of worship and the community's identity as God's chosen people. <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between holy and common, clean and unclean, as part of the priestly duty. The blurring of these lines leads to a loss of reverence for God and His commandments, reflecting a broader cultural and spiritual decline.<p><b>and they fail to distinguish between the clean and the unclean.</b><br>This phrase refers to the ritual purity laws outlined in Leviticus, which were essential for maintaining the community's holiness. The priests' neglect in teaching and upholding these laws results in a community that is spiritually defiled. The distinction between clean and unclean was not merely ceremonial but was intended to teach Israel about the nature of sin and the need for holiness. This failure is indicative of a deeper spiritual blindness and rebellion against God's established order.<p><b>They disregard My Sabbaths,</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). By disregarding the Sabbaths, the priests and people show contempt for God's covenant and His authority. The Sabbath was meant to be a day of rest and worship, a reminder of God's creation and deliverance. <a href="/nehemiah/13-17.htm">Nehemiah 13:17-18</a> also addresses the issue of Sabbath desecration, highlighting its importance in maintaining a right relationship with God. The neglect of the Sabbath is symptomatic of a broader spiritual apathy and rebellion.<p><b>so that I am profaned among them.</b><br>The result of the priests' actions is that God's name and reputation are dishonored among His people. This profaning of God's name is a serious offense, as it reflects a failure to uphold His holiness and glory. The priests' failure to lead and teach the people according to God's standards results in a community that does not reflect God's character. This theme of God's name being profaned is also found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>, where God promises to restore His holy name among the nations. The ultimate fulfillment of God's holiness and the restoration of His name is found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies and reveals God's character to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often focusing on their sins and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel responsible for teaching the law and maintaining the sanctity of worship and religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often depicted in the Old Testament as struggling with faithfulness to God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbaths.htm">Sabbaths</a></b><br>Holy days set apart by God for rest and worship, symbolizing the covenant between God and Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the commandments and instructions given by God to the Israelites, primarily through Moses, to guide their moral and spiritual conduct.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">The Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders are called to uphold and teach God's standards.

The verse calls every generation to honor Scripture as unbreakable truth, treasure what God calls holy, draw clear lines between righteousness and sin, practice rhythms of devotion and rest, and so magnify&#8212;rather than profane&#8212;the Lord before a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Have violated my law.</span>--The next class to be spoken of, as the next in influence, were the priests. It was their especial office to observe and to teach the distinction between the holy and the unholy (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm" title="And that you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;">Leviticus 10:10</a>), and to care for the Sabbath. In all they had been unfaithful. (Comp. <a href="/micah/3-11.htm" title="The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean on the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come on us.">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-4.htm" title="Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.">Zephaniah 3:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The sins of the prophets are followed by these of the priests. Their guilt was that they blurred over the distinction between <span class="cmt_word">the holy and the profane</span> (Revised Version, "common"), <span class="cmt_word">between the clean and the unclean</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>, where the same terms are used), in what we have learnt to call the positive and ceremonial ordinances of the Law, and so blunted their keenness of perception in regard to analogous moral distinctions. Extremes meet, and in our Lord's time the same result was brought about by an exaggerated scrupulosity about the very things the neglect of which was, in Ezekiel's time, the root of the evils which he condemns. This was true generally, conspicuously true in the case of the sabbath. Its neglect was a crying evil in Ezekiel's time, just as its exaggeration was in the later development of Judaism. Though in itself positive rather than moral, <span class="cmt_word">to hide the eyes</span> from its holiness was, for these to whom the commandment had been given, an act of immorality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Her priests</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1462;&#1436;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;ne&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
