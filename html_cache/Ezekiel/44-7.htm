The term "abominations" is often used in the Old Testament to describe practices that are detestable to God, such as idolatry and moral corruption. Ezekiel frequently addresses the abominations of Israel, highlighting their departure from God's laws and the covenant established with them.<p><b>you brought in foreigners uncircumcised in both heart and flesh</b><br>The inclusion of "foreigners" refers to non-Israelites who were not part of the covenant community. Circumcision was a physical sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). However, the emphasis here is on being "uncircumcised in both heart and flesh," suggesting a lack of spiritual commitment and purity. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, where God calls for a circumcision of the heart, symbolizing true devotion and obedience.<p><b>to occupy My sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary, or temple, was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Allowing those who were not consecrated to occupy it was a violation of its sanctity. This reflects the broader theme in Ezekiel of the desecration of holy spaces, which is a serious offense in the context of Israel's worship and relationship with God.<p><b>you defiled My temple when you offered My food&#8212;the fat and the blood</b><br>The temple was defiled through improper offerings. The "fat and the blood" were significant parts of the sacrificial system (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16-17</a>), reserved for God alone. Offering them improperly or in a defiled state was a direct violation of the sacrificial laws. This act of defilement is reminiscent of the corrupt practices condemned by the prophets, where the outward rituals were performed without true reverence or obedience.<p><b>you broke My covenant</b><br>Breaking the covenant refers to Israel's failure to uphold the terms of the agreement established with God at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The covenant was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God, involving laws, promises, and obligations. This breach is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where the prophets call the people back to faithfulness and warn of the consequences of covenant unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites who were not part of the covenant community, specifically those "uncircumcised in heart and flesh."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place of worship, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred agreement between God and Israel, which included laws and rituals to maintain holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Actions considered detestable by God, often associated with idolatry and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_worship.htm">Holiness of Worship</a></b><br>God's sanctuary is a place of holiness, and those who enter must do so with reverence and purity.

Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation "strangers" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2-7</a>), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the "strangers" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8, 10</a>) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16, 22</a>), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14, 29</a>) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such "sons of the stranger" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh.
