The context is the period of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites are questioning God's justice due to their suffering and displacement. Historically, this reflects a time of crisis and doubt among the people, who are struggling to understand their circumstances in light of their covenant with God.<p><b>&#8216;The way of the Lord is not just.&#8217;</b><br>Here, the Israelites are accusing God of injustice. This reflects a common theme in the prophetic books where people question God's fairness, especially when facing punishment or hardship. Theologically, this accusation challenges the character of God as depicted throughout the Bible, where His ways are described as righteous and just (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). This complaint is similar to the sentiments expressed in other parts of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>) and reflects a misunderstanding of divine justice, which often transcends human comprehension.<p><b>But it is their way that is not just.</b><br>This response from God through the prophet Ezekiel turns the accusation back on the Israelites, highlighting their own moral failings. The phrase underscores the biblical principle that human ways are often flawed and unjust (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). It serves as a call to self-examination and repentance, urging the people to recognize their own sins and the consequences thereof. This theme is consistent with the prophetic message throughout the Old Testament, where the call to return to God's ways is central (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3-7</a>). Theologically, it points to the need for a savior, fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect justice and righteousness (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The prophet now proclaims what he had been taught, perhaps then, without proclaiming it, in <a href="/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25-30</a>. Men are dealt with by the Divine Judge, not as their fathers have Been before them, not even as they themselves have been in times past, but exactly as they are. Where could there be a more perfect rule of equity? The question how far Ezekiel thinks of the judgment itself as final, whether there is the possibility of repentance and pardon after it has fallen, and during its continuance, is not directly answered. He is speaking, we must remember, of a judgment on this side the grave, and therefore what we call the problems of eschatology were not before him. But the language of the document which lies at the basis of his theology (<a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>) asserts that if men repented and, "accepted" their earthly punishment, then Jehovah would remember his covenant, and would not destroy them utterly. And his own language as to Sodom and Samaria (<a href="/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53</a>) indicates a leaning to the wider hope. If the problems of the unseen world had been brought before him, we may believe that he would have dealt with them as with those with which he actually came in contact, and that there also his words would have been, "O house of Israel, O sons of men, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet your people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
