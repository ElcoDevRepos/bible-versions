This phrase suggests a divine judgment executed through human agents. In biblical history, God often used nations or leaders to carry out His judgments, as seen with the Assyrians and Babylonians. The concept of righteous judgment aligns with passages like <a href="/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>, which speaks of justice bringing joy to the righteous.<p><b>to the punishment of those who commit adultery and bloodshed</b><br>Adultery and bloodshed are serious offenses in the biblical law, both punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>, <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). In <a href="/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, these sins symbolize Israel and Judah's spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry, equated with adultery, and their violence and injustice, equated with bloodshed. The punishment reflects the severity of their covenant breach with God, reminiscent of the consequences outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience.<p><b>because they are adulteresses</b><br>The imagery of adultery is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8-9</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>). This metaphor highlights the intimate covenant relationship between God and His people, akin to a marriage. Their pursuit of other gods and alliances with foreign nations is seen as spiritual infidelity, breaking the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>with blood on their hands</b><br>This phrase indicates guilt and responsibility for violence and injustice. In biblical terms, having "blood on their hands" signifies culpability for murder or oppression (<a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). It underscores the moral and ethical corruption of the people, who have not only turned from God but have also engaged in acts that defile the land and violate His commandments. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>, where the shedding of innocent blood is condemned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
