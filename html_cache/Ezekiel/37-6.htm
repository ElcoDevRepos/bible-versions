In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, the vision of the dry bones represents the house of Israel in exile, seemingly lifeless and without hope. The attachment of tendons symbolizes the beginning of God's restorative work, bringing structure and connection back to the scattered and disjointed nation. This imagery parallels the creation account in Genesis, where God forms man from the dust, highlighting God's power to create and restore life.<p><b>and make flesh grow upon you</b><br>The growth of flesh upon the bones indicates the process of renewal and regeneration. In the ancient Near Eastern context, flesh represents vitality and strength. This phase of restoration suggests not only physical revival but also the return of strength and identity to the people of Israel. It echoes the promise of restoration found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>, where God promises to recover the remnant of His people.<p><b>and cover you with skin</b><br>Covering with skin completes the physical restoration, making the body whole and recognizable. Skin serves as a protective layer, signifying God's provision and care. This imagery can be connected to the protective nature of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where God assures His people of His constant presence and protection.<p><b>I will put breath within you</b><br>The breath represents the Spirit of God, essential for true life. In Hebrew, the word for breath, "ruach," also means spirit, indicating a deeper spiritual revival beyond mere physical restoration. This act mirrors the creation of Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into man, and foreshadows the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, signifying the birth of the Church and the new life in Christ.<p><b>so that you will come to life</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the result of God's restorative work: life. It signifies not just physical existence but a return to covenant relationship with God. The revival of the dry bones is a metaphor for the spiritual awakening and renewal of Israel, pointing to the ultimate resurrection hope found in Christ, as affirmed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, where all are made alive in Christ.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The ultimate purpose of this miraculous restoration is the recognition of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout the Old Testament, God's acts of deliverance and restoration serve to reveal His identity and character to His people. This acknowledgment of God as LORD is central to the covenant relationship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises to take Israel as His people and be their God. This phrase underscores the theme of divine revelation and the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Tendons symbolize God&#8217;s power to pull what is hopelessly separated back into ordered unity (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, &#8220;In Him all things hold together,&#8221;).<p>- The Lord alone chooses the pieces and fits them precisely, reminding us that national and personal restoration begins with His initiative, not human effort (<a href="/jeremiah/32-27.htm">Jeremiah 32:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and make flesh grow upon you</b><p>- Muscles and organs provide strength and function. God promises not merely to link bones but to supply everything needed for vigorous life (<a href="/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a>).<p>- He restores what time, exile, and sin have stripped away, echoing <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a> where God pledges, &#8220;I will restore to you the years the locusts have eaten.&#8221;<p>- The growing flesh points to a tangible, bodily renewal&#8212;anticipating the future resurrection when the righteous will be raised incorruptible (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52-53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cover you with skin</b><p>- Skin gives identity and wholeness; it protects and displays God&#8217;s workmanship. The Lord promises a complete restoration visible to all (<a href="/isaiah/60-15.htm">Isaiah 60:15-16</a>).<p>- Outward evidence of God&#8217;s work silences doubt, just as the healed man in <a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a> could testify, &#8220;I was blind, but now I see.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will put breath within you so that you will come to life</b><p>- Breath (spirit) is the decisive gift. <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> shows the pattern: &#8220;Then the LORD God formed man&#8230; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.&#8221;<p>- Physical structure without God&#8217;s Spirit is still dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). Here the promise points both to Israel&#8217;s national revival and to personal regeneration by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5-8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>).<p>- The same breath empowers mission (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>) and guarantees future resurrection life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><p>- Every stage of renewal has one ultimate aim: that people recognize the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty and character (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, &#8220;You will know that I am the LORD your God&#8221;).<p>- Knowledge here is relational, producing worshipful obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>).<p>- The restored nation will become a living testimony to surrounding nations, proclaiming that the God of Scripture keeps His covenants (<a href="/zechariah/8-23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/37-6.htm">Ezekiel 37:6</a> promises a step-by-step transformation: reconnection (tendons), strengthening (flesh), completion (skin), animation (breath), and recognition (knowing the LORD). Literally fulfilled in Israel&#8217;s future resurrection and foreshadowed in every believer&#8217;s new birth, the verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereign ability to bring the utterly dead to vibrant, purposeful life so that His glory is unmistakably seen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The process of revivification is now divided into two stages - a preliminary stage which should effect the reconstruction of the external skeleton, by bringing together its different parts and clothing them with <span class="cmt_word">sinews, flesh, and skin</span> (comp. <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>); and a finishing stage, which should consist in animating, or "putting breath in" the reconstructed skeleton; corresponding so the two stages into which the process of man's original creation was divided (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>).
