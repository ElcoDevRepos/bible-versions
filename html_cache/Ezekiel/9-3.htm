The cherubim are angelic beings that are often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, such as the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the Ark itself (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). The movement of God's glory signifies a significant shift, indicating divine displeasure and impending judgment. This event foreshadows the departure of God's presence from the temple, a theme that is further developed in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>.<p><b>where it had been</b><br>This indicates the previous resting place of God's glory, emphasizing the stability and permanence that was expected of God's presence among His people. The Holy of Holies was the most sacred part of the temple, symbolizing God's covenant relationship with Israel. The departure from this place suggests a breach in that relationship due to the people's idolatry and sin.<p><b>and moved to the threshold of the temple</b><br>The threshold represents a transitional space, symbolizing the boundary between the sacred and the profane. God's movement to the threshold suggests a readiness to leave the temple entirely, highlighting the seriousness of Israel's spiritual condition. This movement is a precursor to the eventual destruction of the temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC, as prophesied by Ezekiel and other prophets.<p><b>And He called to the man clothed in linen</b><br>The man clothed in linen is often interpreted as an angelic figure or a priestly representative, given the linen garments associated with priestly duties (<a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>). Linen signifies purity and holiness, appropriate for a divine messenger tasked with executing God's judgment. This figure is reminiscent of the angelic beings in <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a> and <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>, who also wear linen.<p><b>who had the writing kit at his side</b><br>The writing kit indicates a role of recording or marking, suggesting a task of documentation or distinction. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/9.htm">Ezekiel 9</a>, this man is instructed to mark the foreheads of those who lament over the abominations in Jerusalem, signifying divine protection amidst judgment. This act parallels the sealing of the 144,000 in <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3-4</a>, where God's faithful are marked for preservation.

The scene blends sorrow and sovereignty: God&#8217;s glory departs because of persistent sin, yet He personally oversees both judgment and protection. The passage challenges us to honor His presence, trust His justice, and cling to His preserving grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The glory . . . to the threshold.</span>--In <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a> the prophet had seen the same vision as he has described in Ezekiel 1 standing at the entrance of the court of the priests, and there it still remained. The word <span class= "ital">cherub </span>is here used collectively. Now that special glory above the cherubim, which represented the Divine Being Himself, was gone from its place to the threshold of the house, but is returned again in <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1</a>. At the same time, there is also suggested the idea that the ordinary presence of God between the cherubim in the Holy of Holies within the Temple has left its place, and come out to the door of the house. The two ideas are indeed distinct, and yet by no means incapable of being blended in the imagery of a vision. The significance of the former is that the command for judgment proceeds from the very Temple itself to which the Pharisaic Jews looked as the pledge of their safety; while the other would mean that the Lord had already begun to forsake His Temple. Both thoughts are true, and both are emphasised in the course of the vision.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was gone up;</span> better, <span class="accented">went up.</span> The prophet saw the process as well as the result. The "glory of the Lord" which he bad seen (<a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>) by the northern gate rose from its cherub throne (we note the use of the singular to express the unity of the fourfold form), as if to direct the action of his ministers, to the threshold of the "house." This may be connected also with the thought that the normal abiding place of the presence of the Lord had been "between the cherubim" (<a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>) of the mercy seat, but that thought seems in the present instance to be in the background, and I adopt the former interpretation as preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the glory</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;
