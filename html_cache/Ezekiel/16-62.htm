The concept of a covenant is central to the biblical narrative, representing a solemn agreement between God and His people. Historically, covenants were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often involving mutual commitments. In the biblical context, God's covenants with figures like Noah, Abraham, and Moses are foundational. This renewal echoes the promise of restoration and redemption, pointing to God's unwavering faithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament.<p><b>and you will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ultimate purpose of God's actions: to reveal His identity and sovereignty to His people. The knowledge of God as "the LORD" (Yahweh) is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, underscoring His authority and the intimate relationship He desires with His people. In the historical context, Israel's idolatry and alliances with other nations had obscured their understanding of God. This declaration serves as both a promise and a warning, reminding them of His power and their need for repentance. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative where knowing God is equated with experiencing His salvation and grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a> and <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and restoration to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom God is speaking through Ezekiel, often depicted as an unfaithful bride in this chapter, symbolizing their idolatry and unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement between God and His people, often involving promises and obligations.

He is not negotiating; He is declaring. Ezekiel has just recounted Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness (<a href="/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59-61</a>). Yet the Lord steps in: &#8220;So I will establish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> shows this same unilateral resolve: &#8220;I will establish My covenant between Me and you&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a> reflects it in the promise of a new covenant written on the heart.<p>The emphasis is on God&#8217;s initiative. Though His people had shattered fellowship, He moves first, proving that grace precedes human response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My covenant</b><p>&#8220;A covenant&#8221; in Scripture is far more than a contract; it is a bond God Himself guarantees.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> the Lord speaks of an &#8220;everlasting covenant of peace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a> echoes, &#8220;I will betroth you to Me forever.&#8221;<p>This line in 16:62 recalls the same everlasting, restorative arrangement. Despite past judgment, God promises a relationship grounded in steadfast love and secured by His own character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with you</b><p>The covenant is personal and particular. The &#8220;you&#8221; is Jerusalem&#8212;representative of the whole nation (<a href="/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-27</a> cites Isaiah to affirm that the covenant will culminate in Israel&#8217;s ultimate salvation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> widens the picture: &#8220;They will look on Me whom they have pierced.&#8221;<p>God&#8217;s pledge is not abstract. It embraces real people, once rebellious, now reclaimed. By extension, Gentile believers are grafted in (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>), enjoying the same covenantal mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will know</b><p>Knowing here is experiential, not merely intellectual. God&#8217;s restoration produces recognition born out of relationship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a> promises, &#8220;I will give them a heart to know Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ezekiel frequently repeats, &#8220;Then they will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>; 37:13).<p>This knowledge grows out of witnessing His faithfulness: judgment made His holiness clear; restoration reveals His grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I am the LORD</b><p>The climax centers on God&#8217;s name and reputation.

God takes the initiative to re-establish a covenant broken by sin. He binds Himself to His people personally, guaranteeing that through His restorative work they will experientially know He is the LORD.
