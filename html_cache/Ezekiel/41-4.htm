The act of measuring signifies God's attention to detail and the sacredness of the space. The inner sanctuary, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where God's presence dwelt. This mirrors the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>, emphasizing the continuity of God's dwelling place among His people.<p><b>to be twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide</b><br>The dimensions of twenty cubits by twenty cubits highlight the perfect square shape of the Most Holy Place, symbolizing completeness and perfection. A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the room about 30 feet by 30 feet. This size is consistent with the dimensions of the Holy of Holies in Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>). The square shape can also be seen as a type of the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>, which is also a perfect square, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity.<p><b>And he said to me,</b><br>The speaker here is likely an angelic guide, as seen throughout Ezekiel's vision of the temple. This guide provides Ezekiel with understanding and insight, similar to the role of angels in other prophetic visions, such as in Daniel and Revelation. The communication underscores the divine origin and authority of the vision.<p><b>&#8220;This is the Most Holy Place.&#8221;</b><br>The declaration of the Most Holy Place identifies it as the central and most sacred area of the temple. In the Old Testament, this was where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, and only the high priest could enter once a year on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). This space represents the presence of God and foreshadows the ultimate access to God provided through Jesus Christ, who is described as our high priest in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>.
