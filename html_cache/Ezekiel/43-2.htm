In the context of Ezekiel, this vision occurs after the prophet's earlier visions of the departure of God's glory from the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>). The return of God's glory from the east signifies restoration and hope for Israel. The east is significant as it is the direction from which the sun rises, symbolizing new beginnings and divine intervention. Biblically, the east is also where the Garden of Eden was located (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>) and where the wise men saw the star heralding Jesus' birth (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>), linking this vision to themes of redemption and messianic prophecy.<p><b>His voice was like the roar of many waters,</b><br>The comparison of God's voice to "the roar of many waters" emphasizes His power and majesty. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15 and 14</a>:2, to describe the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of God's presence. The sound of many waters can be both comforting and terrifying, reflecting God's ability to bring peace and judgment. In the ancient Near East, water was a symbol of chaos and power, and God's voice overpowering the waters signifies His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>and the earth shone with His glory.</b><br>The earth shining with God's glory indicates the transformative impact of His presence. This echoes the experience of Moses, whose face shone after encountering God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>), and foreshadows the New Jerusalem, where God's glory provides light (<a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>). The shining earth symbolizes the restoration and renewal that comes with God's presence, pointing to the ultimate redemption of creation. This phrase also highlights the universal scope of God's glory, extending beyond Israel to encompass the entire earth, fulfilling the promise that "the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea" (<a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_god_of_israel.htm">The Glory of the God of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to the divine presence and majesty of God, often depicted as a radiant light or cloud.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_east.htm">The East</a></b><br>Symbolically significant in Scripture, the east often represents the direction from which divine intervention or blessing comes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_like_the_roar_of_many_waters.htm">Voice like the Roar of Many Waters</a></b><br>This imagery conveys the power and majesty of God's voice, emphasizing His authority and might.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth_shone_with_his_glory.htm">The Earth Shone with His Glory</a></b><br>This indicates the transformative and illuminating effect of God's presence on creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_presence.htm">The Majesty of God's Presence</a></b><br>God's glory is overwhelming and transformative.

Now, decades into exile, he is allowed to see the glory return.<p>&#8226; This moment assures the prophet&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s faithfulness has never lapsed.<p>&#8226; The language echoes <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>, where God&#8217;s glory appeared &#8220;like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Like Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>) and John beholding the incarnate Word (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), Ezekiel experiences the weighty presence of the Lord in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>coming from the east</b><p>The glory &#8220;coming from the east&#8221; deliberately retraces the historic route of departure: the presence left Jerusalem by way of the east gate (<a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God now returns along the same axis, highlighting His covenant resolve to restore what was lost.<p>&#8226; The east is the direction of sunrise, signaling new beginnings; <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a> calls Messiah &#8220;the Sun of Righteousness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus later ties His own appearing to the east&#8212;&#8220;as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> pictures the Lord standing on the Mount of Olives, east of the city, underscoring one consistent trajectory of divine visitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His voice was like the roar of many waters</b><p>Ezekiel hears an overwhelming sound: &#8220;His voice was like the roar of many waters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s voice is never weak or uncertain. <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-4</a> describes it as &#8220;over the waters&#8230; powerful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>, the glorified Christ speaks with the same thunderous resonance, affirming the unity of Father and Son.<p>&#8226; Earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a> the beating wings of the cherubim sounded &#8220;like the roar of rushing waters,&#8221; preparing the prophet for this fuller encounter.<p>&#8226; The imagery communicates authority that silences every rival claim; when God speaks, creation itself must listen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the earth shone with His glory</b><p>Finally, Ezekiel notes, &#8220;the earth shone with His glory.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The brilliance is not confined to a temple; it spills across the landscape, prefiguring <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>: &#8220;the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a> declares, &#8220;the whole earth is full of His glory,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> sees the New Jerusalem illuminated not by sun or moon but by &#8220;the glory of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Even Moses&#8217; face glowed after meeting the Lord (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>); here the glow is universal, hinting at the coming millennial reign when righteousness lights every corner.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> applies this radiance to believers today&#8212;God shines &#8220;in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel literally witnesses the return of God&#8217;s glory, confirming His unbreakable covenant with Israel.<p>&#8226; The eastward approach underscores both restoration and the future appearing of Christ.<p>&#8226; The thunderous voice reveals unmatched authority, echoed in both Testaments.<p>&#8226; The radiant earth anticipates a day when God&#8217;s presence saturates all creation.<p>Taken together, <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a> assures us that the Lord who once departed will unfailingly return&#8212;visibly, audibly, and gloriously&#8212;to dwell among His people forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Scarcely had the prophet taken up his station at or near the gate when <span class="cmt_word">the glory of the God of Israel</span> (see on Ezekiel 1:28; 3:23) <span class="cmt_word">came from the way of the east</span>, as if intending to enter the temple by the very door through which it had previously departed from the temple (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22, 23</a>).

The statement that <span class="cmt_word">the earth shined with his glory</span> (comp. <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>) has by Havernick, Kliefoth, and others been supposed to indicate the absence of that "cloud" in which the glory of Jehovah appeared in both the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>) and the Solomonic temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>), and thereby to point to the clearer and more resplendent manifestations of the Godhead, which were to be given in connection with the new dispensation for which Ezekiel's "house" was being prepared. This, however, as Keil has shown, cannot be main-rained in face of the facts that in both Exodus and 1 Kings "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord"</span> is used synonymously with "the cloud," and that in Ezekiel's vision "the glory" and "the cloud" were alike present (see <a href="/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3, 4</a>). Kliefoth and Schroder hold "the earth" which was illumined to have been "the whole globe," "the entire region of humanity," as in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, etc.;
