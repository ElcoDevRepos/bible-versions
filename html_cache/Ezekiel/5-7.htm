This is significant because Israel was chosen to be a holy nation, set apart to reflect God's character (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The comparison to other nations underscores the gravity of their rebellion, as they were expected to adhere to a higher standard due to their covenant with God.<p><b>you have not walked in My statutes or kept My ordinances,</b><br>This phrase points to Israel's failure to live according to God's laws, which were given to guide them in righteousness (<a href="/leviticus/18-4.htm">Leviticus 18:4-5</a>). The statutes and ordinances refer to the comprehensive legal and moral code found in the Torah. Their disobedience is a breach of the covenant, which had clear stipulations and consequences (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>nor have you even conformed to the ordinances of the nations around you.</b><br>Ironically, Israel not only failed to follow God's laws but also did not adhere to the common moral standards of the surrounding nations. This highlights their complete moral and spiritual decline. The nations around Israel, despite their idolatry, often had societal norms that Israel failed to meet.

The latter we conceive to be the true sense here. If Israel did precisely what the heathen did, they would be far more unfaithful (See <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm" title="And you shall know that I am the LORD: for you have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.">Ezekiel 11:12</a>.)

The question may, therefore, be naturally asked whether it is justifiable to interpret it in a relative sense, and if so, on what grounds? The answer to these questions must be sought in a consideration of the whole character and history of Israel, which will show that what might be only a relatively greater wickedness in them according to a human standard, becomes, under the circumstances, an absolutely greater sin against God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye multiplied,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">because ye are turbulent.</span> The vereb is cognate with the noun translated "tumult" in <a href="/1_samuel/4-14.htm">1 Samuel 4:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-3.htm">Isaiah 33:3</a>, though it is more commonly rendered "multitude."
