In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/32.htm">Ezekiel 32</a>, this refers to the judgment upon Egypt and its leader, Pharaoh. The imagery of the afterlife here is consistent with ancient Near Eastern beliefs about the dead being aware of their surroundings. The "comfort" mentioned is ironic, as it implies a grim satisfaction in seeing others share his fate. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where the proud and powerful are brought low. The multitude refers to the Egyptian army and people, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the judgment.<p><b>Pharaoh and all his army</b><br>This phrase highlights the collective judgment on both the leader and his forces. Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, often relying on its military might. The mention of the army underscores the futility of relying on human strength against divine judgment. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God opposes the proud and brings down those who trust in their own power (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>). The judgment on Pharaoh and his army serves as a warning to other nations and leaders who might oppose God's will.<p><b>slain by the sword</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol of judgment and warfare. In this context, it signifies the violent end that awaits Pharaoh and his forces. This phrase connects to the broader theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic books, where God uses nations as instruments of His judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The imagery of the sword also points to the inevitability of God's decrees, as seen in the fall of other nations like Assyria and Babylon. The sword here is not just a literal weapon but a representation of God's righteous judgment.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "declares the Lord GOD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. It assures the audience that the words spoken are not merely human predictions but are guaranteed by the sovereign will of God. This declaration serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over history and His ability to bring about His purposes, as seen in other prophetic declarations (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). The use of "Lord GOD" highlights both His covenantal relationship with His people and His supreme authority over all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the nation and its power.

The verse drives home four truths: God&#8217;s judgments are real, comprehensive, and executed by His sovereign hand; worldly power offers no escape; and the Lord&#8217;s spoken word is utterly certain. The passage strengthens faith by showing that every boastful kingdom, no matter how formidable, must bow before the righteous, covenant-keeping God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Shall be comforted.--</span>Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/31-16.htm" title="I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.">Ezekiel 31:16</a>.<p>Here closes the series of prophecies against foreign nations. It is true that there are other prophecies against them in Ezekiel 35, 38, 39; but these, as already said, have much more of the character of promises to Israel than of simple denunciation of their enemies. The greater part of this series was uttered between the investment and the close of the siege of Jerusalem, a time during which the prophet was to be dumb towards the children of his people, and at the close of which his mouth was again to be opened. At this time, therefore, his prophetic gifts were appropriately exercised towards foreigners, and at the close, with the renewal of his instructions to Israel, a fresh charge is given as a sort of fresh induction to his prophetic office (<a href="/context/ezekiel/33-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 33:1-30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be comforted</span>, etc. (comp. for the thought, <a href="/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>). That shall be all that he will have to console him. As before, other nations were comforted by the downfall of Egypt, so Egypt in her turn finds her comfort in their downfall. All are sharers alike in the fiend-like temper which exults in the miseries of others. Ewald and Hitzig, here as there, take the word as in the sense of "mourning over." As to the extent and manner in which the predictions of the chapter have been fulfilled, see notes on Ezekiel 29. - 31. Sufficient evidence has been given that Egypt was probably invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. The silence of the Greek historians, and notably of Herodotus, as to any such invasion goes for little or nothing. He could not read the Egyptian records, and derived his knowledge from the priests through an interpreter. They, after their manner, would draw a veil over all disasters, and so, while he records the revolution which placed Amasis upon the throne of Hophra, he is silent as to any invasion, and does not even mention the battle of Carchemish. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/32-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will see them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and be comforted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1495;&#1463;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#183;&#7717;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
