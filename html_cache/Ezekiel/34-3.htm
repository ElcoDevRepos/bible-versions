In biblical times, "fat" symbolized the best or richest part of the offerings, often reserved for God (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). The leaders were consuming what was meant for the people's benefit, reflecting selfishness and neglect of their duties. This behavior contrasts with the sacrificial system where the fat was burned as an offering to God, indicating a misuse of what was sacred.<p><b>wear the wool</b><br>Wool was a valuable commodity in ancient Israel, used for clothing and trade. The leaders are accused of taking the wool for themselves, symbolizing their exploitation of the people for personal comfort and wealth. This imagery highlights their failure to care for the flock, as shepherds were expected to protect and provide for their sheep, not exploit them. This selfishness is condemned in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/micah/3.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>, where leaders are criticized for their greed and oppression.<p><b>and butcher the fattened sheep</b><br>The phrase indicates the leaders' willingness to destroy the very ones they were supposed to nurture. Fattened sheep were typically prepared for special occasions or sacrifices, symbolizing abundance and blessing. By butchering them for personal gain, the leaders are depicted as merciless and self-serving. This imagery is a stark contrast to the Good Shepherd, a type of Christ, who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>but you do not feed the flock</b><br>The primary duty of a shepherd is to feed and care for the flock, ensuring their well-being and growth. The leaders' failure to do so represents a neglect of their God-given responsibilities. This neglect is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, where leaders are often rebuked for failing to uphold justice and care for the vulnerable (<a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the role of the true Shepherd, feeding His flock with spiritual nourishment and guidance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds_of_israel.htm">Shepherds of Israel</a></b><br>Metaphorically refers to the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, who were under the care of their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were exiled to Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection on their relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate Shepherd, who holds the leaders accountable for their failure to care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_of_leaders.htm">Accountability of Leaders</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for the care and well-being of those they lead.
