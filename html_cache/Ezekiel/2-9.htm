In biblical narratives, the act of looking often precedes a significant vision or message from God. Ezekiel's visions are central to his prophetic ministry, emphasizing the importance of being attentive to God's communication.<p><b>and saw a hand reaching out to me</b><br>The imagery of a hand reaching out is symbolic of divine intervention and communication. In the Bible, God's hand often represents His power and authority (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). This hand reaching out to Ezekiel signifies God's direct involvement in delivering His message. It also reflects the personal nature of God's call to Ezekiel, emphasizing that the message is specifically for him to receive and convey.<p><b>and in it was a scroll</b><br>Scrolls were the primary medium for writing in ancient times, often used for recording important documents, including religious texts. The presence of a scroll indicates that the message Ezekiel is about to receive is authoritative and significant. Scrolls in biblical literature often contain divine decrees or revelations (<a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>). This particular scroll symbolizes the word of God that Ezekiel is to proclaim, highlighting the prophetic nature of his mission. The scroll's content, which is revealed in the following verses, underscores themes of judgment and lamentation, aligning with the broader context of Ezekiel's prophecies concerning Israel's disobedience and the impending consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand.htm">The Hand</a></b><br>Represents God's divine intervention and communication with Ezekiel, symbolizing authority and the delivery of His word.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>A symbol of God's message, containing His words of lamentation, mourning, and woe, which Ezekiel is to deliver to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_communication.htm">Divine Communication</a></b><br>God uses various means to communicate His will to His people, emphasizing the importance of being attentive to His messages.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_god's_word.htm">The Authority of God's Word</a></b><br>The scroll signifies the authority and seriousness of God's message.

It is not that a hand by itself containing the roll was sent to the prophet, but a hand, either of one of the cherubim,. or from the throne above, was stretched forth to him. In the corresponding vision in <a href="/context/revelation/10-8.htm" title="And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands on the sea and on the earth.">Revelation 10:8-9</a>, it is handed to the seer by the angel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hand was sent</span> (<span class="accented">put forth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">unto me,</span> etc. Apparently the hand was not that of the human form seated on the throne (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), nor of one of the four living creatures (<a href="/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>), but one appearing mysteriously by itself, as in the history of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>). The words connect themselves with the use of the hand stretched out of a cloud as the symbols of the Divine energy both in Jewish and Christian art. The writer has in his possession a Jewish brass tablet, probably of the sixteenth century, commemorating the legend of the miraculous supply of oil at the Feast of the Dedication, in which such a hand appears as pouring oil into the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp, of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, a roll of a book,</span> etc. The words remind us of the volume, or roll, in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; like those which are still used in Jewish synagogues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;er&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reaching out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">was a scroll,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7713;il&#183;la&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4039.htm">Strong's 4039: </a> </span><span class="str2">A scroll</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 2:9 When I looked behold a hand was (Ezek.
