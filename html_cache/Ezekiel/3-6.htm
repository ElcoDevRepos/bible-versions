The "many peoples" refers to the Gentile nations surrounding Israel, known for their diverse languages and cultures. Historically, these nations included the Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and others, each with distinct languages and customs. The mention of "unfamiliar speech and difficult language" underscores the communication barrier that would exist if Ezekiel were sent to them. This reflects the broader biblical theme of language as a barrier, first introduced at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where God confused human language to scatter people across the earth. The inability to understand their words symbolizes the spiritual and cultural divide between Israel and the Gentile nations. This context emphasizes the unique calling of Israel as God's chosen people, who were expected to understand and respond to His message.<p><b>Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you</b><br>This statement contrasts the expected response of the Gentile nations with that of Israel. It suggests that the Gentiles, despite their unfamiliarity with God's laws, might have been more receptive to Ezekiel's prophetic message than Israel, who had the Law and the Prophets. This echoes the theme found in the New Testament, where Jesus and the apostles often found greater faith among Gentiles than among the Jewish people (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-10.htm">Matthew 8:10</a>, <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>). The implication is a critique of Israel's hard-heartedness and a foreshadowing of the Gospel's eventual spread to the Gentiles. This also serves as a prophetic type of Christ, who, like Ezekiel, was sent to His own people but was often rejected, leading to the message of salvation being extended to all nations. The phrase underscores the accountability of those who have received God's revelation and the openness of God's grace to all who are willing to listen.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Israel has long enjoyed the privilege of covenant revelation (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7-8</a>; <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>). That privilege heightens responsibility; the target audience cannot plead ignorance when they resist the word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of unfamiliar speech and difficult language</b><p>The Lord emphasizes what He is not requiring of Ezekiel. No cultural or linguistic barrier stands between preacher and listeners, unlike the &#8220;nation whose language you do not understand&#8221; used as judgment in <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>. Communication will be perfectly clear; only the will can rebel (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose words you cannot understand</b><p>Every excuse is stripped away. Israel speaks Ezekiel&#8217;s own tongue; they possess the &#8220;oracles of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>). If they harden their hearts, it will be deliberate (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>), not due to confusion or lack of access.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>surely if I had sent you to them</b><p>God employs a stark contrast. Historically, Gentile outsiders often responded when Israel would not: Nineveh repented at Jonah&#8217;s single sermon (<a href="/bsb/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41</a>), and Jesus declared Tyre and Sidon would have turned long ago if they had seen His miracles (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21-22</a>). The hypothetical amplifies Israel&#8217;s guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they would have listened to you</b><p>Foreigners, with far less light, would have welcomed the message. Receptivity hinges on humility, not background (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). Israel&#8217;s stone-like heart (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-9</a>) stands exposed. Possessing the Scriptures without submission invites sharper judgment (<a href="/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23-24</a>; <a href="/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-6.htm">Ezekiel 3:6</a> underscores that God sent His prophet to a people fully able to understand but unwilling to obey.
