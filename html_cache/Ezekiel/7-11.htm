The "rod" symbolizes authority and discipline, often used in Scripture to denote correction (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites' own actions have led to their downfall, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>). The imagery of a rod also connects to the idea of God's sovereignty, where He uses nations like Babylon as instruments of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).<p><b>None of them will remain:</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the impending judgment. It reflects the complete desolation that will come upon the people, reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of disobedience. Historically, this was fulfilled during the Babylonian conquest, where many Israelites were killed or taken into exile. The phrase also echoes the finality of God's judgment seen in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2-3</a>.<p><b>none of their multitude,</b><br>The term "multitude" refers to the population of Israel, emphasizing that the judgment will be widespread and affect all social classes. This aligns with the historical context of the Babylonian siege, where both the common people and the elite suffered. The comprehensive nature of the judgment serves as a warning to future generations about the seriousness of turning away from God.<p><b>none of their wealth,</b><br>The loss of wealth signifies the stripping away of material security and prosperity, which the Israelites had wrongly placed their trust in. This reflects the biblical theme that true security comes from God alone (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). The destruction of wealth also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly possessions, as echoed in Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>.<p><b>and nothing of value.</b><br>This phrase indicates that everything the Israelites held dear would be taken away, leaving them with nothing. It highlights the futility of idolatry and misplaced priorities, as seen in the broader context of Ezekiel's prophecies against the idolatrous practices of Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4-6</a>). The complete loss serves as a call to repentance and a return to valuing what is truly important in God's eyes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, specifically the people of Judah who are facing imminent judgment due to their persistent sin and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites are experiencing the consequences of their disobedience through captivity and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, particularly violence and wickedness, leads to destruction and judgment.

The prophet has already cataloged murder and oppression in the temple courts (<a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>) and on the mountains (<a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>). Micah condemned the same culture: &#8220;They covet fields and seize them&#8221; (<a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). Violence isn&#8217;t a side issue; it has become their defining trait.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into a rod</b><p>What they have nurtured now hardens into the very instrument that will strike them. Scripture often portrays a &#8220;rod&#8221; as corrective discipline&#8212;parents wield it in <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>, and God wields it in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, calling Assyria &#8220;the rod of My anger.&#8221; Judah&#8217;s own sin forges the switch that will fall across her back. As <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> says, &#8220;His violence will recoil on his own head.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to punish their wickedness</b><p>This is righteous recompense, not random calamity. Earlier in the chapter God says, &#8220;I will judge you according to your ways; I will repay all your abominations&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3-4</a>). The principle reverberates through Scripture: &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a> shows the pattern&#8212;God gives people over to the very sins they choose, and those sins become the judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>None of them will remain</b><p>The impending Babylonian invasion will leave no safe corner. &#8220;I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>). Jeremiah spoke the same word: &#8220;Disaster is going forth from nation to nation&#8230; those slain by the LORD on that day will extend from one end of the earth to the other&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29-33</a>).

The exile will prove that when God judges, &#8220;their fortified cities will be destroyed&#8230; so that none will dwell there&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>). Anything they once prized becomes meaningless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a> sketches a solemn cause-and-effect: unchecked violence hardens into God&#8217;s disciplinary rod. Because Judah refuses to repent, judgment sweeps away people, crowds, wealth, and every treasured possession. The verse warns that sin is never static&#8212;it grows, forges its own weapon, and finally consumes all the sinner trusts in. Only obedience and humble dependence on the LORD secure lasting safety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Neither shall there be wailing for them.--</span>The word for <span class= "ital">wailing </span>is another of those words occurring only in this passage which have been variously understood. It is now generally taken for that which is glorious or beautiful. Israel has run its circle; prosperity has developed pride, and pride has culminated in all wickedness; now the end has come, they and their tumult (marg., <span class= "ital">for multitude</span>) disappear together, and of their glory there shall be nothing left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violence is risen up,</span> etc. The "violence" admits of the same twofold interpretation as the "pride" of ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">None of them shall remain.</span> The interpolated verb, though grammatically necessary, weakens the force of the Hebrew. "None of them; none of their multitude; none of their wealth." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> The noun is not found elsewhere. Taken, as the Authorized Version takes it, the thought, like that of <a href="/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, is that the usual rites of burial would be neglected, and that there would be "no widows to make lamentation" (<a href="/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). The Revised Version "eminency" implies the loss of all that constituted greatness. Cornill and the LXX. ("beauty" or "gaiety") practically agree with this. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">requies</span>, and Furst "a gathering, or tumult of the people."
