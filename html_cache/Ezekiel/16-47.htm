Walking in their ways suggests adopting their lifestyle and moral conduct, which were contrary to God's commandments. Historically, the Israelites were warned against adopting the customs of the Canaanites and other pagan nations (<a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3</a>). This reflects a pattern of disobedience and assimilation into the surrounding culture, which led to spiritual and moral decline.<p><b>and practiced their abominations</b><br>Abominations refer to actions that are detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and immoral practices. In the context of Ezekiel, these abominations included idol worship, child sacrifice, and sexual immorality. The term is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe practices that are particularly offensive to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>). The Israelites were explicitly commanded to avoid such practices, yet they engaged in them, showing a blatant disregard for God's law.<p><b>but soon you were more depraved than they were</b><br>This phrase highlights the extent of Jerusalem's sinfulness, surpassing even that of the notoriously wicked cities of Samaria and Sodom. The comparison to Sodom is significant, as Sodom is often used as a symbol of extreme moral corruption (Genesis 19). The historical context shows that Jerusalem, despite having the Temple and the Law, fell into greater depravity, indicating a deeper level of rebellion against God. This serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God's ways and the potential for sin to escalate when unchecked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Sodom had indeed sinned grievously in its day, but more than 1,000 years had since passed, in which resistance to Divine admonitions had led on to a still more grievous depth of wickedness; and Samaria had been carried into captivity more than a century before the time of the prophet, and during this period the people, with now and then a few short intervals of reformation, had been tending steadily downwards.
