In biblical terms, God's "hand" often symbolizes His power and authority. The stretching out of His hand signifies an active move to discipline or punish. This is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God uses His hand to execute judgment, such as in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a> during the plagues of Egypt. It reflects God's direct involvement in the affairs of His people, particularly when they stray from His commandments.<p><b>and reduced your portion</b><br>The reduction of "portion" refers to a decrease in blessings, prosperity, or territory. In the context of ancient Israel, a portion often meant the land or inheritance given by God. This reduction is a consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's law. The loss of portion serves as a tangible reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you</b><br>This phrase suggests a withdrawal of divine protection, allowing enemies to have their way with Israel. It reflects the principle found in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God "gave them over" to their sinful desires as a form of judgment. The enemies' desires likely include conquest, oppression, and humiliation. This handing over is a direct result of Israel's infidelity and serves as a wake-up call to return to God.<p><b>the daughters of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant adversary of Israel throughout the Old Testament, often representing paganism and opposition to God's people. The mention of "daughters" could symbolize the Philistine cities or people as a whole. Historically, the Philistines occupied the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their military prowess and idolatrous practices. Their involvement underscores the severity of Israel's situation, as even these traditional enemies are appalled by Israel's conduct.<p><b>who were ashamed of your lewd conduct</b><br>This phrase highlights the extent of Israel's moral and spiritual decline. The term "lewd conduct" refers to idolatry and unfaithfulness, often depicted metaphorically as adultery in the prophetic literature. The fact that even the Philistines, known for their own immoral practices, are ashamed indicates the depth of Israel's corruption. This shame serves as a powerful indictment, emphasizing the need for repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His judgment and actions against Israel due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation being addressed, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, symbolizing their spiritual adultery and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people historically in conflict with Israel, here representing those who despise Israel's conduct.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_the_philistines.htm">Daughters of the Philistines</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Philistine people, highlighting their disdain for Israel's behavior.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lewd_conduct.htm">Lewd Conduct</a></b><br>Refers to Israel's idolatry and spiritual unfaithfulness, which even their enemies found shameful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's actions against Israel demonstrate His holiness and intolerance of sin.

Philistia was but a small power in the south-west corner of Palestine, yet from the time of the Judges down through the whole period of the monarchy, they were the persistent foes of Israel. During the time immediately before Samuel, they held nearly the entire land in subjection, and although subdued by David, they became troublesome again in the times of the later kings (see <a href="/2_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelled in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.">2Chronicles 26:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.">2Chronicles 28:18</a>), and are often spoken of not only by the earlier prophets, Isaiah and Amos, but also by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm" title="And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,">Jeremiah 25:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.">Jeremiah 47:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/25-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;">Ezekiel 25:15-16</a>), and Zechariah <a href="/zechariah/9-6.htm" title="And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.">Zechariah 9:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have diminished thine ordinary food</span>.
