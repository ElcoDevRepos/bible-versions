The raised base signifies stability and separation from the profane, emphasizing the sacredness of the temple. In ancient architecture, a raised platform often denoted importance and reverence. This mirrors the elevated position of the temple in Jerusalem, which was built on Mount Moriah, symbolizing its spiritual prominence.<p><b>forming the foundation of the side rooms</b><br>The side rooms, or chambers, were likely used for storage and priestly functions, indicating the temple's role as a center of worship and administration. The foundation's solidity underscores the permanence and reliability of God's dwelling place.

A cubit was a standard unit of measure in ancient times, approximately 18 inches, but a "long cubit" was slightly longer, about 21 inches. This specific measurement highlights the meticulous nature of God's design.

is reporting what God deliberately shows him, just as earlier measurements were received &#8220;in the visions of God&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord reveals it, we can trust each detail as purposeful and accurate, fitting the pattern of God&#8217;s meticulous instructions for the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>) and Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-11.htm">1 Kings 6:11&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the temple had a raised base all around it</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;raised base&#8221; sets the sanctuary above the surrounding ground, marking clear separation between the holy and the common&#8212;echoing the way Mount Sinai was fenced off (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>) and how the priests ministered on an elevated platform in the future temple (<a href="/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Elevation emphasizes honor and security (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>). God lifts His dwelling place, and by extension lifts His people, establishing firmness beneath their feet (<a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The all-around nature of the base shows completeness; nothing in God&#8217;s house is left unfortified (<a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>forming the foundation of the side rooms</b><p>&#8226; These side rooms (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5&#8211;10</a>) likely serve practical purposes&#8212;storage for offerings and garments (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>), and quarters for priests (<a href="/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>).<p>&#8226; A sturdy foundation guarantees that priestly service remains uninterrupted, hinting at the unshakable priesthood of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; By tying the rooms&#8217; stability to the temple&#8217;s own footing, God illustrates how every ministry must rest on His ordained structure (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was the full length of a rod, six long cubits</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rod&#8221; recalls the measuring tool earlier introduced: &#8220;The measuring rod in his hand was six long cubits&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>). One long cubit equals a standard cubit plus a handbreadth&#8212;roughly 21 inches&#8212;making the rod about 10&#189; feet (3.2 m).<p>&#8226; A single, uniform measurement for the entire foundation underscores God&#8217;s orderliness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) and impartiality&#8212;every side, every room stands on the same exact measure.<p>&#8226; The specification anticipates the precise measurements of the New Jerusalem, where an angel likewise uses a rod (<a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a> reveals a temple set high and firm: God shows it, God raises it, God founds every chamber upon it, and God measures it with flawless precision.

The words are, literally, <span class= "ital">I saw for the house a height </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an elevation) <span class= "ital">round about,</span> and the meaning of this is explained in what follows. The Temple, as has been already said (<a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm" title="The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.">Ezekiel 40:49</a>), was entered by a flight of steps leading up to the porch, and was therefore on a higher level than the court. We are now told that the side chambers had a foundation of six cubits. Whether this "foundation" of the Temple and the side chambers was built of masonry, or, as is more probable, was a sort of basement to contain cisterns and storage rooms, we are not told; but it probably extended, under the name of "the place that was left" (<a href="/ezekiel/41-9.htm" title="The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.">Ezekiel 41:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/41-11.htm" title="And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.">Ezekiel 41:11</a>), five cubits beyond the outer wall of the chambers, forming a platform from which they were entered.<p><span class= "bld">Six great cubits.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">six cubits to the joint,</span> or <span class= "ital">to the armpit,</span> for the word has both significations. It is plain that a cubit of a different length, measured to the armpit, cannot be intended, both because no such cubit is known to have been in use at any time, and because Ezekiel in <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a> has already fixed the length of the cubit he uses. The sense of <span class= "ital">joint</span> is therefore to be taken, and this applied architecturally can only mean the point at which one part of the building joins another; here, the point where the superstructure meets the foundation, or, as we should say, "six cubits to the water-table."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> explains that "the house" did not stand upon the level ground, but, like many temple buildings in antiquity (see Schurer, in Riehm's 'Handworterbuch,' art. "Tern. pel Salerno"), <span class="cmt_word">upon a height</span> - or, <span class="accented">raised basement</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">round about</span>, which agrees with the statement in <a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> that the temple was approached by means of a stair. In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">full reed of six great cubits</span>; or, <span class="accented">of six cubits to the joining</span> (Revised Version); "six cubits to the story" (Ewald); literally, <span class="accented">six cubits to the armpit</span>. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
