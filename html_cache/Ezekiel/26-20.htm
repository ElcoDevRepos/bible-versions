In biblical terms, the Pit is a place of the dead, a realm of the departed spirits. This reflects the ultimate humiliation and destruction of Tyre, a once-proud and prosperous city. The imagery of descending to the Pit is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the fate of the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>). It signifies a complete and irreversible downfall.<p><b>to the people of antiquity</b><br>The "people of antiquity" refers to those who have already died and are in Sheol. This suggests that Tyre's fate will be similar to that of ancient civilizations that have perished and been forgotten. It emphasizes the finality of Tyre's destruction, aligning with the biblical theme that no earthly power can withstand God's judgment. Historically, Tyre was a significant Phoenician city, known for its wealth and influence, but like many ancient powers, it was subject to divine retribution.<p><b>I will make you dwell in the earth below like the ancient ruins</b><br>This phrase underscores the desolation that will befall Tyre. The "earth below" is a metaphor for Sheol, and "ancient ruins" suggests a state of complete abandonment and decay. The comparison to ancient ruins highlights the inevitability of Tyre's fall, as even the mightiest cities eventually succumb to time and divine judgment. Archaeologically, ruins of ancient cities serve as a testament to the transient nature of human achievements.<p><b>with those who descend to the Pit</b><br>Reiterating the earlier phrase, this emphasizes the company Tyre will keep in its downfall. It will join the ranks of other nations and peoples who have faced God's judgment and now reside in Sheol. This repetition serves to reinforce the certainty and severity of the prophecy against Tyre. The Pit is a common biblical motif for the grave or the abode of the dead, symbolizing the end of earthly existence and glory.<p><b>so that you will no longer be inhabited</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells the complete depopulation of Tyre. The city, once bustling with life and commerce, will become uninhabited. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine judgment leading to desolation, as seen in other prophecies against cities like Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>) and Nineveh (<a href="/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13-15</a>). Historically, Tyre was besieged and eventually fell, fulfilling this prophecy of desolation.<p><b>or set in splendor in the land of the living</b><br>The phrase "set in splendor" refers to Tyre's former glory and prominence. The prophecy declares that Tyre will no longer be a place of beauty or significance among the living. This reflects the biblical principle that human pride and splendor are temporary and subject to God's sovereign will. The "land of the living" contrasts with the Pit, emphasizing the transition from life and prosperity to death and obscurity. This serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of pride and defiance against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Tyre is here represented, as Babylon is there, as joining itself to the dead--a striking figure to indicate its utter and final destruction. This is to be understood of the Tyre that then was, the proud mistress of the sea. The question whether there might or might not ever be other inhabitants on the rock of Tyre is one which does not at all come within the scope of the prophet's vision. The way of speaking of the place of the dead, as in the lower part of the earth, so common in Scripture (comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>), does not by any means prove that the writers thought this to be the actual place of departed spirits, but only that, as it is a necessity of human thought and expression to indicate some locality, this locality, in association with the burial of the body, is most naturally placed "under the earth." In the same way, men, even on opposite sides of the globe, always speak of God as "above them," and their gestures and looks, as well as their words, unavoidably involve the same idea, though they perfectly know that He is omnipresent. (Comp. even the example of our Lord in <a href="/mark/6-41.htm" title="And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.">Mark 6:41</a>; <a href="/mark/7-34.htm" title="And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.">Mark 7:34</a>; <a href="/luke/9-16.htm" title="Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.">Luke 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall bring thee down</span>, etc. The pit is <span class="accented">sheol</span>, Hades, the unseen world of the dead. The image may have been suggested by <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, where it is used of Babylon. It was obviously one on which the mind of Ezekiel dwelt, and is reproduced in <a href="/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>. Here, apparently, the sinking in the depth of the waters (Ver. 19) is thought of as leading to that world of the dead that lay beneath them. <span class="cmt_word">The people of old</span> <span class="cmt_word">time</span> may possibly include the races of the old world that were submerged in the waters of the Flood. The imagery of <a href="/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3-7</a> seems to have been floating before the prophet's mind. <span class="cmt_word">I shall set glory</span>; better, <span class="accented">will set</span>. The contrast drawn is that between the shadow-world of the dead, and the earth with its living inhabitants. There Jehovah would establish his glory, would, sooner or later, manifest his kingdom, while Tyre and its pomp should be no more, belonging only to the past. Conjectural readings and renderings have been suggested as follows: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig, "And thou no longer shinest with glory in the <span class="accented">land of the living</span>." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Havernick and Kliefoth, "That I no longer produce anything glorious from thee in the land of the living." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald," That thou mayest not remain (or stand) in the laud of the living." I have adopted Keil's interpretation of the Anthorized Version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/26-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then I will bring you down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7695;&#183;t&#238;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
