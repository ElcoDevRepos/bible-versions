In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/24.htm">Ezekiel 24</a>, the prophet Ezekiel is addressing the exiles in Babylon. The people are likely questioning the meaning of the symbolic acts and prophecies Ezekiel has been delivering. This reflects a common theme in prophetic literature where prophets often respond to the people's inquiries or disbelief. It also highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people.<p><b>The word of the LORD came to me</b><br>This phrase is a common introduction in prophetic literature, signifying divine revelation. It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, indicating that it is not Ezekiel's own words but a direct communication from God. This divine communication is central to the prophetic office and is a hallmark of true prophecy, distinguishing it from false prophets who speak from their own imagination (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>Saying:</b><br>The colon here introduces the specific message or instruction from God. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/24.htm">Ezekiel 24</a>, what follows is a significant and symbolic message regarding the impending destruction of Jerusalem. This serves as a pivotal moment in Ezekiel's ministry, as it marks the fulfillment of earlier prophecies and the realization of God's judgment. The use of direct speech emphasizes the immediacy and seriousness of the divine message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic acts.
