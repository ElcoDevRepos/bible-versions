It is also a title used by Jesus in the New Testament, highlighting His identification with humanity. In Ezekiel's context, it underscores his role as a prophet among the Israelites, a people in exile and in need of divine guidance.<p><b>I have made you a watchman</b><br>The role of a watchman in ancient times was crucial for the safety of a city. Positioned on city walls, watchmen would alert the inhabitants of impending danger. Spiritually, Ezekiel's role as a watchman signifies his responsibility to warn Israel of spiritual and moral dangers. This concept of spiritual vigilance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be watchful and alert (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>for the house of Israel;</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, including both the northern and southern kingdoms. At this time, many Israelites were in Babylonian exile, having been taken from their homeland due to their disobedience to God. Ezekiel's messages were directed towards these exiles, calling them to repentance and faithfulness.<p><b>so hear the word from My mouth</b><br>Ezekiel is instructed to receive direct revelation from God. This emphasizes the divine origin of his message, distinguishing it from human wisdom or opinion. The phrase underscores the importance of prophets speaking only what God commands, a theme consistent throughout the Bible (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-20</a>).<p><b>and give them the warning from Me.</b><br>The warning is a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness. It reflects God's desire for His people to turn from their wicked ways and avoid judgment. This prophetic warning is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God consistently sends messengers to call His people back to righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this call to repentance is found in Jesus Christ, who came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who were in exile due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/watchman.htm">Watchman</a></b><br>A metaphorical role assigned to Ezekiel, symbolizing vigilance and responsibility to warn the people of impending danger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who appoints Ezekiel as a watchman and communicates His messages through him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as the backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">Responsibility of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was appointed as a watchman, spiritual leaders today have the responsibility to guide and warn their congregations based on God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_faith.htm">Vigilance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to be vigilant in their faith, staying alert to spiritual dangers and responding to God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Ezekiel's role underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, both for leaders and followers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>The watchman is accountable for delivering God's message, reminding us of our accountability in sharing the Gospel and living out our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god's_voice.htm">Listening to God's Voice</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the need to listen to God's voice and act upon His instructions, a crucial aspect of a faithful life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_33_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 33:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_watchman_in_Ezekiel_33_7.htm">How does Ezekiel 33:7 define the role of a "watchman" for believers today?

While God remains sovereign, He singles out the prophet, showing that individual obedience matters in the divine plan (compare <a href="/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22</a>, where Jesus says, &#8220;What is that to you? You follow Me!&#8221;). Ezekiel cannot hide in the crowd; his orders are direct and non-negotiable. This echoes earlier moments when the Lord isolates a servant for a task&#8212;think of Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) or Paul on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>). The phrase reminds us that every believer must respond to God&#8217;s calling personally, not vicariously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O son of man</b><p>God addresses Ezekiel by a title used over ninety times in the book, emphasizing both his humanity and his representative role. In <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, the same term highlights the contrast between God&#8217;s faithfulness and human frailty. By repeating &#8220;son of man,&#8221; the Lord keeps Ezekiel humble, ensuring he remembers that the authority he will wield is delegated, not innate. Likewise, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a> speaks of &#8220;treasure in jars of clay,&#8221; reinforcing that divine power works through ordinary vessels.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have made you a watchman</b><p>A watchman in ancient cities stood on the wall, scanning the horizon for danger. God appoints Ezekiel, not Israel. The calling is God-given, not self-chosen (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, &#8220;Before I formed you&#8230;I appointed you a prophet&#8221;).<p>Key functions of a watchman:<p>&#8226; Vigilance&#8212;constant alertness (<a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Warning&#8212;sounding the trumpet at first sign of threat (<a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Accountability&#8212;blood guilt rests on derelict sentinels (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>).<p>Believers today share a similar mandate in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>, being spiritually awake and ready to sound the alarm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the house of Israel</b><p>The assignment is specific: God&#8217;s covenant people. Though in exile, they remain His chosen nation (<a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1-2</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s message targets hardened hearts (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>), yet God seeks repentance, not destruction. This focus also foreshadows the church&#8217;s obligation to begin &#8220;in Jerusalem, and in all Judea&#8221; before reaching &#8220;the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Calling starts at home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so hear the word from My mouth</b><p>Before Ezekiel can speak, he must listen. Revelation precedes proclamation&#8212;see <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God pledges to put His words in the prophet&#8217;s mouth. Jesus models the same posture in <a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>, saying He speaks only what the Father commands. Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Daily intake of Scripture (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Sensitivity to the Spirit (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Silence before service, as illustrated when Elijah heard the &#8220;gentle whisper&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give them the warning from Me</b><p>The prophet&#8217;s task is not suggestions but &#8220;the warning,&#8221; a term carrying urgency. Paul mirrors this seriousness in <a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>, declaring himself &#8220;innocent of the blood of all men&#8221; because he did not shrink from declaring God&#8217;s whole counsel. Effective warning includes:<p>&#8226; Clarity&#8212;no ambiguity about sin and judgment (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Compassion&#8212;desire for repentance, not condemnation (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Courage&#8212;willingness to be unpopular, as Amos was at Bethel (<a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-13</a>).<p>Ultimately, the warning is God&#8217;s; the messenger delivers but cannot dilute it (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a> presents a chain of divine commissioning: God personally addresses His servant, reminds him of human frailty, appoints him as a vigilant watchman, specifies the audience, insists on attentive hearing, and commands faithful warning. The verse underscores accountability&#8212;both to God for obedience and to the people for their response. For modern believers, the passage calls us to personal responsibility, humble dependence, vigilant readiness, focused ministry, attentive listening, and courageous proclamation of God&#8217;s unfiltered truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
