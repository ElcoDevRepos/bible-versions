The twenty-fifth year would place this vision around 573 BC. The exile was a time of deep reflection and transformation for the Jewish people, as they were removed from their homeland and temple, which was central to their worship and identity.<p><b>at the beginning of the year</b><br>The beginning of the year likely refers to the month of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar, which is significant as it marks the start of the religious year. This time is associated with the Passover, a festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing hope and renewal.<p><b>on the tenth day of the month</b><br>The tenth day of Nisan is notable in Jewish tradition as the day when the Passover lamb was selected, as described in <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>. This connection underscores themes of redemption and deliverance, which are central to Ezekiel's visions of restoration.<p><b>in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been struck down</b><br>This reference to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC by the Babylonians serves as a reminder of the judgment that befell the city due to the people's unfaithfulness. The fourteen-year gap highlights a period of mourning and reflection, setting the stage for Ezekiel's vision of hope and restoration.<p><b>on that very day</b><br>The specificity of "that very day" emphasizes the importance and divine timing of the vision. It suggests that God's revelations are precise and purposeful, aligning with significant dates in Israel's history to convey deeper meanings.<p><b>the hand of the LORD was upon me</b><br>This phrase indicates divine inspiration and empowerment. Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the "hand of the LORD" signifies God's direct intervention and guidance, enabling the prophet to receive and communicate His messages.<p><b>and He took me there</b><br>God's transportation of Ezekiel in visions is a recurring theme, illustrating the prophet's role as a mediator between God and His people.

This vision was seen "in the beginning of the year." The Jews always reckoned the month Abib, or Nisan, in which the Passover was celebrated, as the beginning of the year, according to the command given in <a href="/exodus/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,">Exodus 12:1</a>, and the "tenth day" of that month was the day in which the preparations for the Passover began, and hence a most appropriate season for this vision of the Church of the future. Others consider that this was a Jubile year (for which there is no evidence); and since the Jubile began at the great fast of the Atonement, on the tenth day of the seventh month, it is thought that this is the day here intended. At a much later time the Jews sometimes reckoned the years from the Jubile, but there is nothing to show that this custom began so early. In either case the text distinctly says that it was fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem; a substantial period had, therefore, elapsed in which this great judgment would have produced its effect upon the minds of the exiles; there was thus now occasion for bringing before them the brighter hopes of the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - The <span class="accented">introduction to the vision</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the five and twentieth year of our captivity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in <span class="date">B.C. 575</span>, assuming Jehoiakin's deportation to have taken place <span class="date">B.C. 600</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the fiftieth year of the prophet's age, in the twenty-fifth of his prophetic calling, and in the fourteenth after the fall of Jerusalem. As the last note of time was the twelfth year (<a href="/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17</a>), it may be assumed the interval was largely occupied in receiving and delivering the prophecies that fall between those dates, though it is more than likely a period of silence preceded the vision of which this last section of the book preserves an account. If not the last of the prophet's utterances (see <a href="/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17</a>), it was beyond question the grandest and most momentous. Accordingly, the prophet notes with his customary exactness that the vision came to him <span class="cmt_word">in the beginning of the year</span>, which Hitzig, whom Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' follows, believes to have been a jubilee year, which began on the tenth day of the seventh month. As, however, the practice of commencing the year with this month was not introduced among the Jews till after the exile, and as Ezekiel everywhere follows the purely Mosaic arrangement of the year, the presumption is that the beginning of the year here alluded to was the month Abib, and that <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">tenth day of the month</span> was the day on which the Torah enjoined the selection of a lamb for the Passover. Indeed, the two clauses in Ezekiel read like an abbreviation of the Mosaic statute (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2, 3</a>) - a circumstance sufficiently striking and probably significant, though emphasis should not, with Hengstenberg, be laid upon the fact that every word in Ezekiel's copy is found in the Exodus original. On that day, which was the anniversary of the beginning of a merciful deliverance to Israel in Egypt, of the initial step in a gracious process of transforming Pharaoh's captives into a nation, - on that day (for emphasis <span class="cmt_word">the selfsame day</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>), the prophet's soul was rapt into an ecstasy (see on Ezekiel 1:3), in which he seemed to be transported thither, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> towards the smitten city, and a disclosure made to him concerning that new community which Jehovah was about to form out of old Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the twenty-fifth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
