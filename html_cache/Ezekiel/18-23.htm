In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their disobedience, and this verse underscores God's desire for repentance rather than punishment. The question reflects God's consistent nature throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where it states that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's justice and mercy, as seen in the story of Jonah and Nineveh, where God relents from sending calamity when the people repent.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority and sovereignty of God. The use of "declares" indicates a definitive statement from God, emphasizing that this is not merely a human opinion but a divine truth. The title "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) combines God's covenant name with His title as Creator and Ruler, reinforcing His ultimate authority over life and death. This declaration is consistent with God's self-revelation throughout the Old Testament, where He often speaks directly to His people through prophets.<p><b>Wouldn&#8217;t I prefer that he turn from his ways and live?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's desire for repentance and life. The concept of "turning" is central to the biblical idea of repentance, which involves a change of direction and heart. The call to "turn from his ways" implies a personal responsibility to abandon sinful behavior and align with God's will. The promise of life for those who repent is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where God sets before the people life and death, urging them to choose life. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel, expressing His desire for repentance rather than punishment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to those who live in sin and rebellion against God's commandments, specifically the Israelites who have turned away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and returning to God, which is central to the message of this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/life.htm">Life</a></b><br>Symbolizes not just physical life but spiritual renewal and restoration in relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_heart_for_repentance.htm">God's Heart for Repentance</a></b><br>God does not delight in punishment but desires that all turn from their sinful ways and live.

Judgment comes only after persistent rebellion; it is never an end God enjoys.<p>- Throughout Scripture, sin&#8217;s consequences grieve the Lord because every person bears His image (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). His displeasure is with wickedness itself, not with seeing people destroyed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><p>- The phrase underscores authority and certainty. The covenant-keeping LORD puts His own name behind this statement; it is not a prophet&#8217;s opinion (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>- Similar divine oaths appear in <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>, showing a consistent, unchanging heart.<p>- Because God cannot lie, the promise that He takes no pleasure in death is as reliable as His promise to judge unrepentant sin. Justice and mercy meet in His character; neither is compromised.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wouldn&#8217;t I prefer that he turn from his ways and live?</b><p>- &#8220;Turn&#8221; summarizes repentance: a decisive break from sin toward obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30&#8211;32</a>; <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>).<p>- &#8220;Live&#8221; points to covenant blessing now and eternal life ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who came that we &#8220;may have life, and have it in abundance&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>- Key truths:<p>&#8226; Repentance is possible for every individual; guilt is not inescapable heredity (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God actively invites: &#8220;Choose life&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). He provides the means&#8212;first through the sacrificial system, finally through the cross (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The responsibility lies with the sinner: God prefers salvation, but He will not force it (<a href="/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart: He takes no pleasure in judgment; He stands by His word; He longs for repentance that leads to genuine life. Judgment is real, yet mercy is extended to all who will turn and live.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Have I any pleasure at all?</span>--This brings out that fundamental truth which underlies the whole teaching of both the Old and New Testaments, and which should have satisfied Israel of the Lord's readiness to receive every penitent sinner. God created man; and when he had fallen, ordered both the old and the new dispensations, and employed methods of infinite love to win him to salvation. He can have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; His delight can only be when man fulfils the design for which he was created, and returns to obedience and communion with God. Yet neither, as is declared in the next verse, can the Almighty suffer that His creature should set at nought His love and despise His salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have I</span> <span class="cmt_word">any pleasure,</span> etc.? Ezekiel's anticipations of the gospel of Christ take a yet wider range, and we come at last to what had been throughout the suppressed premise of the argument. To him, as afterwards to St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and St. Peter (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), the mind of God was presented as being at once absolutely righteous and absolutely loving. The death of the wicked, the loss, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of true life, for a time, or even forever, might be the necessary consequence of laws that were righteous in themselves, and were working out the well being of the universe; but that death was not to be thought of as the result of a Divine decree, or contemplated by the Divine mind with any satisfaction. If it were not given to Ezekiel to see, as clearly as Isaiah seems to have seen it, how the Divine philanthropy was to manifest itself, he at least gauged that philanthropy itself, and found it fathomless. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do I take any pleasure</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1465;&#1444;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2654.htm">Strong's 2654: </a> </span><span class="str2">To incline to, to bend, to be pleased with, desire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the death</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the wicked?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Would I not prefer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he turn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
