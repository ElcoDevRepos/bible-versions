In the context of Ezekiel, God is addressing the failure of Israel's leaders, the shepherds, who have neglected their duties. The "good pasture" signifies a place of abundance and safety, contrasting with the barren and dangerous conditions under poor leadership. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where the Lord leads His sheep to green pastures, emphasizing God's role as the ultimate Shepherd. It also foreshadows Jesus Christ, who in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a> declares Himself the Good Shepherd, providing for and protecting His flock.<p><b>and the lofty mountains of Israel will be their grazing land</b><br>The "lofty mountains of Israel" symbolize strength, stability, and divine presence. Mountains in biblical literature often represent places of revelation and encounter with God, such as Mount Sinai and Mount Zion. In Ezekiel's time, these mountains were literal highlands, offering fertile land for grazing. This promise indicates a return to the land and a restoration of Israel's fortunes. It also points to a future hope where God's people will dwell securely in His presence, as seen in prophetic visions of a restored Israel (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>There they will lie down in a good grazing land</b><br>The image of lying down suggests peace, rest, and security, free from fear and danger. This echoes the pastoral imagery of <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where the sheep lie down in green pastures, symbolizing trust in the Shepherd's provision. In the historical context, this promise would have been particularly comforting to the exiled Israelites, who longed for stability and safety. It also prefigures the peace that Christ offers to believers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>, where He invites the weary to find rest in Him.<p><b>they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel</b><br>The "rich pasture" signifies not only physical abundance but also spiritual richness and fulfillment. The mountains of Israel, as a recurring motif, highlight the centrality of the land in God's covenant promises. This phrase assures the exiles of a future where they will experience God's blessings in fullness. It also connects to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16-17</a>, where the Lamb shepherds His people, leading them to springs of living water, fulfilling the ultimate promise of divine provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, promising to care for His people as a shepherd cares for his flock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the promise is made, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_israel.htm">Mountains of Israel</a></b><br>Symbolic of a place of safety, abundance, and divine provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphor for God&#8217;s leadership and care, contrasting with the unfaithful shepherds (leaders) of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/good_pasture.htm">Good Pasture</a></b><br>Represents spiritual nourishment and well-being provided by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithful_provision.htm">God's Faithful Provision</a></b><br>God promises to provide for His people, ensuring they have all they need spiritually and physically.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_leadership.htm">Divine Leadership</a></b><br>Unlike human leaders who may fail, God is the ultimate Shepherd who leads with wisdom and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rest_and_security_in_god.htm">Rest and Security in God</a></b><br>The imagery of lying down in good grazing land signifies peace and security found in God's presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Just as sheep need good pasture, believers need the Word of God and fellowship with Him for spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers can trust in God's promises of care and provision, even when circumstances seem challenging.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_34_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 34:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_14_God_s_provision_today.htm">How does Ezekiel 34:14 illustrate God's provision for His people today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_good_pasture_in_Ezekiel.htm">What does "good pasture" symbolize in Ezekiel 34:14 for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_spiritual_nourishment.htm">How can we seek spiritual nourishment as described in Ezekiel 34:14?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_14_Psalm_23_2_God_s_care.htm">Connect Ezekiel 34:14 with Psalm 23:2 about God's care for His flock.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_leaders_ensure_spiritual_growth.htm">How can church leaders ensure their congregation finds "rich pasture" spiritually?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_14_on_God_s_care_and_provision.htm">What does Ezekiel 34:14 reveal about God's provision and care for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_14_God_s_restoration_promise.htm">How does Ezekiel 34:14 reflect God's promise of restoration and security?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Ezekiel_34_14_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Ezekiel 34:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_34.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/ezekiel_34__judgment_inconsistencies.htm">Ezekiel 34 -
