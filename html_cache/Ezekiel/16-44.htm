Proverbs were often used to convey wisdom and moral lessons succinctly. The use of proverbs is prevalent throughout the Bible, notably in the Book of Proverbs, which is attributed to Solomon. In this context, the proverb serves as a divine indictment against Jerusalem, highlighting the city's moral and spiritual failings.<p><b>will quote this proverb about you:</b><br>The use of "about you" indicates a direct address to Jerusalem, personified as a woman in this chapter. This personalization emphasizes the intimate and covenantal relationship between God and His people. The prophetic literature often uses such direct addresses to convey the seriousness of the message. The proverb is not just a general saying but is specifically applied to Jerusalem, underscoring the city's guilt and the inevitability of judgment.<p><b>&#8216;Like mother, like daughter.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase suggests a hereditary transmission of behavior and character, implying that Jerusalem has followed in the sinful ways of its predecessors. In the broader context of <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, the "mother" can be seen as the Canaanite nations, whose idolatrous practices Israel adopted. This reflects the biblical theme of generational sin and the consequences of straying from God's commandments. The phrase also echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the iniquity of the fathers is visited upon the children. This proverb serves as a stark reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God and the dangers of cultural assimilation into ungodly practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
