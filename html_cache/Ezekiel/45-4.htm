In the context of ancient Israel, land was often divided for specific uses, with certain portions consecrated for religious functions. The concept of holiness, or being set apart, is central to the identity of Israel as a nation chosen by God (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This holy portion signifies God's presence and the importance of maintaining purity and dedication in worship.<p><b>to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary</b><br>The priests, descendants of Aaron, were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals. Their role was crucial in mediating between God and the people (<a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>). The sanctuary, or temple, was the center of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. This allocation of land underscores the importance of the priestly duties and the need for them to be near the temple to fulfill their responsibilities effectively.<p><b>who draw near to minister before the LORD</b><br>Drawing near to God was a privilege and a serious responsibility for the priests. This phrase highlights the intimate relationship between the priests and God, as they were chosen to serve in His presence (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The act of ministering before the LORD required ritual purity and adherence to God's commandments, reflecting the holiness required to approach Him (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>).<p><b>It will be a place for their houses</b><br>The provision of housing for the priests within this holy portion indicates God's care for those who serve Him. It ensured that the priests could live close to the temple, facilitating their duties. This arrangement also reflects the broader biblical principle of God providing for those who dedicate their lives to His service (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).<p><b>as well as a holy area for the sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary, being the focal point of worship, required a surrounding area that was also consecrated. This separation from common use emphasized the sanctity of the temple and the need for reverence in approaching God. The holy area served as a buffer, maintaining the purity and sanctity of the worship space, similar to the divisions seen in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who received visions and messages from God concerning the future of Israel and the restoration of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, designated to perform sacred duties in the temple, serving as mediators between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place within the temple where God's presence dwells, and where the priests perform their sacred duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_portion_of_the_land.htm">Holy Portion of the Land</a></b><br>A designated area set apart for the priests and the sanctuary, symbolizing God's provision and the sanctity of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the central focus of worship and the one who establishes the covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The concept of a "holy portion" emphasizes the importance of setting apart certain aspects of our lives for God.

Ezekiel specifies that this tract is &#8220;holy,&#8221; set apart exclusively for God, echoing earlier divine allocations such as the Levites&#8217; cities in <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-5</a> and the tabernacle space in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>.<p>&#8226; The holiness is geographic and functional, underscoring that God&#8217;s promises in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> are literal future realities, not mere symbolism, much like the promised boundaries given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary</b><p>&#8226; Only the priestly line&#8212;descendants of Zadok (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>)&#8212;receive this land, preserving the pattern seen when Aaron&#8217;s sons alone handled the sacred objects (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This reinforces God&#8217;s enduring principle of calling specific servants for specific tasks (cf. <a href="/malachi/2-4.htm">Malachi 2:4-7</a>), reminding the church today that distinct roles are part of His orderly design (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who draw near to minister before the LORD</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a> applies this privilege spiritually to all believers, yet Ezekiel shows a future, tangible restoration where priests again perform physical service, confirming God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness to Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will be a place for their houses</b><p>&#8226;

The immediate adjacency of homes to the temple underscores uninterrupted readiness for ministry (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/24-19.htm">1 Chronicles 24:19</a>), prefiguring the eternal state where God dwells among His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a> reveals a literal, future land allotment that is doubly holy&#8212;both residence and workplace&#8212;for the Zadokite priests.
