The "lovers" refer to the foreign nations with whom Israel formed alliances, contrary to God's commands. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The imagery of "lovers" is used metaphorically to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God, akin to adultery, a common prophetic theme (<a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5-7</a>). The use of "delivered" suggests God's sovereign control over the nations and His role in orchestrating events as a form of discipline.<p><b>the Assyrians for whom she lusted</b><br>The Assyrians were a dominant empire during the time of Ezekiel, known for their military prowess and cultural influence. Israel's political and military alliances with Assyria were motivated by a desire for security and prosperity, reflecting a lack of trust in God's protection. This lust for Assyrian power and culture is symbolic of Israel's spiritual adultery, as they sought after foreign gods and customs (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>). Historically, the Assyrians were known for their brutal conquests, and their eventual domination over Israel was both a literal and figurative consequence of Israel's infidelity.
