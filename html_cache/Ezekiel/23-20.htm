The lusting after lovers signifies the nations' pursuit of alliances and idolatry with foreign powers, particularly Egypt and Assyria. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where Israel is often depicted as an unfaithful spouse to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>). The imagery underscores the depth of their infidelity and the betrayal of their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>whose genitals were like those of donkeys</b><br>The comparison to donkeys emphasizes the extreme and unnatural nature of Israel's idolatry and alliances. In ancient Near Eastern culture, donkeys were often associated with strength and virility, but also with stubbornness and foolishness. This metaphor serves to illustrate the degrading and excessive nature of Israel's spiritual unfaithfulness. It also reflects the biblical theme of the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>.<p><b>and whose emission was like that of stallions</b><br>Stallions are known for their powerful and uncontrollable nature, symbolizing the overwhelming and destructive influence of the foreign nations with whom Israel and Judah allied themselves. This imagery conveys the idea of being overwhelmed by the consequences of their choices, leading to spiritual and moral corruption. The use of such vivid and graphic language serves to shock the audience into recognizing the severity of their sin. This aligns with the prophetic tradition of using stark imagery to convey the seriousness of Israel's apostasy (<a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, representing the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel.

Earlier, the prophet describes how they &#8220;defiled themselves with the idols of Egypt&#8221; (v. 7) and &#8220;committed harlotry with the Assyrians&#8221; (v. 5). By verse 20, God employs shocking, earthy imagery to expose the depth of their sin and the intensity of their cravings (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lusted after their lovers</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lovers&#8221; points to the foreign nations and their gods with whom Judah eagerly allied herself&#8212;trusting political power and pagan worship instead of the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>; 31:1).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1-2</a> echoes the same charge: &#8220;You have lived as a prostitute with many lovers&#8230; you have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;lusted&#8221; highlights a deliberate, passionate pursuit, not a momentary slip. Judah&#8217;s sin was persistent, willful, and heart-driven (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-9.htm">Ezekiel 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose genitals were like those of donkeys</b><p>&#8226; Donkeys were notorious for their size; the comparison underscores how brazen and shameless Judah&#8217;s idolatry had become. The nation sought partners noted for their worldly power and sensual appeal, not for righteousness (<a href="/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-8.htm">Isaiah 57:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The image also mocks Judah&#8217;s discernment: what seemed impressive was, in truth, animal-like and unclean (<a href="/psalms/106-39.htm">Psalm 106:39</a>; <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s use of startling language cuts through religious pretense, forcing His people to see their sin for what it truly is&#8212;bestial, degrading, and spiritually destructive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whose emission was like that of stallions</b><p>&#8226; Stallions are famed for vigorous breeding; the phrase paints Judah&#8217;s alliances as prolific and unchecked (<a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>: &#8220;They were well-fed lusty stallions, each neighing after his neighbor&#8217;s wife&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Judah multiplied idols and treaties, pouring energy into every new opportunity for compromise (<a href="/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>; 23:30).<p>&#8226; The resulting &#8220;emission&#8221; suggests both the overwhelming flood of corruption poured into the land and the inevitable defilement that followed (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-17</a>; <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a> employs vivid, jarring metaphors to expose Judah&#8217;s relentless craving for idolatrous relationships. By likening foreign lovers to donkeys and stallions, God reveals how His people traded covenant purity for animal-like passions, embracing alliances that promised power but delivered defilement. The verse is a sober reminder that any pursuit&#8212;political, cultural, or personal&#8212;that replaces trust in the Lord is spiritual adultery, inevitably leading to shame and judgment. God&#8217;s graphic language is love&#8217;s severe mercy, calling His people to recognize sin&#8217;s ugliness and return to exclusive faithfulness to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Their paramours.</span>--The word is masculine, as indicating the abominable sins copied by the Israelites from the heathen, and asses and horses are introduced to show the intensity of lust.

All that need be said of the comparison that follows is that here also Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>). What is indicated is that Judah threw herself into the idolatrous ritual of Egypt with an almost orgiastic passion.
