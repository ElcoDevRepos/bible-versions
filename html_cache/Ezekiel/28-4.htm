In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>, these qualities are attributed to the ruler of Tyre, who is depicted as having used them for self-serving purposes. Biblically, wisdom and understanding are highly valued (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>), but when misused, they can lead to pride and downfall, as seen in the case of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-11</a>). The wisdom of the ruler of Tyre is contrasted with the divine wisdom of God, which is pure and righteous.<p><b>you have gained your wealth</b><br>The accumulation of wealth is a central theme in this passage, reflecting the prosperity of Tyre, a major ancient Phoenician city known for its trade and commerce. Historically, Tyre was a wealthy city due to its strategic location and control over Mediterranean trade routes. The wealth gained by the ruler is seen as a result of human effort and intelligence, yet it also serves as a warning against the dangers of materialism and the false security it can bring (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>and amassed gold and silver for your treasuries</b><br>Gold and silver are often symbols of wealth and power in the Bible. The treasuries of Tyre were filled with these precious metals, signifying the city's economic strength. However, the Bible frequently warns against placing trust in riches (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The amassing of wealth by the ruler of Tyre is depicted as a source of pride and eventual downfall, echoing the fate of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-23</a>). This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly riches and the importance of storing up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
