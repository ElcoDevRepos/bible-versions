Sodom is often remembered for its destruction due to wickedness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The use of "iniquity" highlights moral failure, suggesting that the sins of Sodom are mirrored in Jerusalem. This sets the stage for understanding the nature of the sins being addressed.<p><b>She and her daughters were arrogant:</b><br>Arrogance, or pride, is frequently condemned in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). It suggests a self-sufficient attitude that dismisses the need for God. In the context of Sodom, this pride led to a disregard for divine laws and a sense of superiority over others. This pride is a root sin that often leads to other transgressions.<p><b>overfed:</b><br>This phrase indicates excess and indulgence, suggesting a society focused on material wealth and comfort. In biblical times, being "overfed" would imply neglect of spiritual matters in favor of physical satisfaction. This is reminiscent of the warnings against gluttony and the pursuit of earthly pleasures over spiritual well-being (<a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>).<p><b>and complacent:</b><br>Complacency here refers to a lack of concern or indifference, particularly towards moral and spiritual responsibilities. This attitude can lead to a failure to act justly or to address the needs of others, as seen in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>). It suggests a society that is spiritually asleep, ignoring the call to righteousness.<p><b>they did not help the poor and needy:</b><br>This phrase highlights a failure in social justice, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. The Law of Moses emphasized care for the poor and needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). The neglect of these groups is a significant moral failing, indicating a lack of love and compassion, which are central to the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>). This neglect is a tangible expression of the arrogance and complacency previously mentioned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

By calling Sodom &#8220;sister,&#8221; the Lord shows that covenant people are not immune to the same downfall if they mirror the same rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-30</a>).

These were not only Sodom&#8217;s downfall but a mirror held up to Jerusalem&#8212;and to every generation that enjoys God&#8217;s gifts yet forgets the Giver. Scripture warns that a society swollen with riches but empty of humility and compassion stands in grave danger. The antidote is heartfelt repentance, humble dependence on the Lord, purposeful simplicity, and active mercy toward those in need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness.</span>--The description strikes at the causes rather than the overt acts of sin, and the unnatural crimes which are always associated in our minds with the name of Sodom are not mentioned. It is noticeable, however, that the distinct sin which is mentioned in this passage is the negative one too common in all ages, "neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - It is noticeable that what we commonly speak of as the specific sin of the cities of the plain is not mentioned here. The prophet fixes on the point which made Sodom a luxurious and sensual city, the graver evil being just hinted at in the word <span class="cmt_word">abominations</span>, and as the outcome of the evil tendencies. So in like manner the special sin of Samaria, the worship of the calves, is not named, but taken for granted.

Prosperity and luxury in her case, as in that of other wealthy cities, hardened the hearts of men against the poor and needy. There was probably a sufficient reason for the omission which has been pointed out. It was wiser to dwell on the sins which were common to the two cities rather than on the vice which, though it existed in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), was probably not prevalent there. <span class="cmt_word">As I saw good</span>;
