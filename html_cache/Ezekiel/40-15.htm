The entrance of the gateway signifies the beginning of the sacred space, emphasizing the importance of approaching God with reverence. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, gateways often symbolized transition from the secular to the sacred. This vision of the temple serves as a prophetic symbol of God's future dwelling with His people, reflecting the holiness and order of divine worship.<p><b>to the far end of its inner portico</b><br>The inner portico represents the inner part of the gateway structure, which would have been a covered area leading into the temple complex. This design reflects the architectural style of ancient temples, where porticos served as transitional spaces. The inner portico's mention highlights the detailed and orderly nature of God's design for worship, emphasizing the importance of preparation and sanctification before entering His presence. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gateway to God, providing access to the Father through His sacrifice.<p><b>was fifty cubits.</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making fifty cubits approximately 75 feet or 22.5 meters. The specific measurement underscores the precision and intentionality in God's design for the temple. The number fifty in biblical numerology often symbolizes deliverance or freedom, as seen in the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), which occurred every fifty years and was a time of liberation and restoration. This measurement may prophetically point to the ultimate deliverance and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, bringing spiritual freedom to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> describes a future temple, symbolizing God's presence and the restoration of Israel.

Every span, stone, and stair serves the Lord&#8217;s purpose, just as <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> records the careful timing of Solomon&#8217;s temple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the entrance of the gateway</b><p>&#8226; Gates mark transition&#8212;from common ground to holy ground (<a href="/psalms/118-19.htm">Psalm 118:19-20</a>; <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; In Ezekiel&#8217;s vision, the gate faces east (<a href="/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>), the direction of sunrise and resurrection hope (<a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The gate&#8217;s threshold forms the first step toward fellowship with God, a pattern later fulfilled when Jesus became &#8220;the way&#8221; into God&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the far end of its inner portico</b><p>&#8226; The inner portico is the sheltered area just inside the gate, akin to a foyer.
