The "living creatures" are later identified as cherubim, a class of angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God. These creatures are symbolic of God's majesty and power, often serving as guardians of His holiness. The vision emphasizes God's sovereignty and His active presence even during Israel's captivity.<p><b>I saw a wheel on the ground</b><br>The wheel represents mobility and the omnipresence of God. In ancient Near Eastern iconography, wheels were often associated with chariots, symbolizing divine movement and authority. The presence of the wheel on the ground suggests that God's presence is not confined to the temple in Jerusalem but extends throughout the earth, even in exile. This imagery reassures the exiled Israelites of God's continued involvement in their lives.<p><b>beside each creature</b><br>The positioning of the wheels beside each creature indicates a close relationship between the divine beings and the mechanisms of God's will. This suggests that the cherubim and the wheels work in unison, symbolizing the harmony and order of God's creation and governance. The proximity of the wheels to the creatures underscores the idea that God's plans are executed with precision and purpose.<p><b>with its four faces</b><br>The four faces of the creatures&#8212;man, lion, ox, and eagle&#8212;represent the fullness of creation and the comprehensive nature of God's dominion. Each face symbolizes different aspects of creation: humanity, wild animals, domesticated animals, and birds. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, where similar creatures surround God's throne, highlighting the continuity of God's revelation. The four faces also prefigure the fourfold Gospel portrayal of Jesus Christ: as King (lion), Servant (ox), Son of Man (man), and Divine (eagle).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of divine visions, including the one described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are cherubim, angelic beings that serve as attendants to God&#8217;s throne, each with four faces and four wings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheels.htm">Wheels</a></b><br>Symbolic elements in Ezekiel's vision, representing the mobility and omnipresence of God's divine chariot.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Ezekiel receives his visions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_god's_glory.htm">Vision of God&#8217;s Glory</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where God reveals His majesty and sovereignty through a vivid and symbolic vision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omnipresence_and_omniscience.htm">God&#8217;s Omnipresence and Omniscience</a></b><br>The wheels beside the living creatures symbolize God&#8217;s ability to be everywhere and see everything.

Just as John &#8220;saw four living creatures&#8221; around God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>), Ezekiel&#8217;s vision is a literal disclosure of the heavenly court. Scripture is consistent: from <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where cherubim stand guard at Eden, to <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>, where God is &#8220;enthroned between the cherubim,&#8221; these beings are real and testify to God&#8217;s holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw a wheel</b><p>Ezekiel notices something new&#8212;&#8220;a wheel.&#8221; He is not describing ancient machinery in vague terms; he is recording what the Spirit allowed him to see: an actual wheel that forms part of the mobile throne of God. <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a> speaks of &#8220;wheels of burning fire&#8221; beneath God&#8217;s throne, confirming that God&#8217;s presence is not stationary.

The wheel was <span class= "ital">one </span>in the same sense in which the living creatures were one, yet actually four, as appears from the following verse and the whole subsequent description. In the corresponding vision (<a href="/ezekiel/10-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.">Ezekiel 10:9</a>), they are at once described as four. The cherubim had been seen in the cloud (<a href="/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-5</a>); now they need to be connected below with the earth, and presently (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) above, with the throne of God. Therefore the wheel is "upon the earth," but of a great height (<a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>). There was a wheel in front of each of the cherubim, again forming a square, yet so that, as already said, they might in a sense be all considered as one wheel. Reference has been made for the origin of this imagery to the wheels under the <span class= "ital">ten bases </span>of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/context/1_kings/7-32.htm" title="And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.">1Kings 7:32-33</a>); but there seems to be nothing either in size or form to correspond, and, so far as we know, the imagery here is purely original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold one wheel,</span> etc. As the prophet gazed, yet another marvel presented itself - a "wheel" was seen.
