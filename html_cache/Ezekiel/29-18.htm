It is used over 90 times in the book, highlighting the contrast between the divine message and the human messenger. It also prefigures the title used by Jesus in the New Testament, emphasizing His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was a powerful ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. He is known for his military conquests and the expansion of Babylon. His campaigns against various nations, including Judah and Tyre, are well-documented in both biblical and extra-biblical sources. His role in biblical prophecy is significant, as he is often seen as an instrument of God's judgment.<p><b>caused his army to labor strenuously against Tyre</b><br>The siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar lasted for 13 years, from 585 to 572 BC. Tyre was a fortified island city with strong defenses, making it a formidable target. The prolonged effort required significant resources and manpower, reflecting the intensity and difficulty of the campaign. This historical event is corroborated by ancient historians like Josephus.<p><b>Every head was made bald and every shoulder made raw</b><br>This imagery describes the physical toll on the soldiers due to the lengthy siege. The baldness likely refers to the wearing away of hair from helmets, while raw shoulders suggest the chafing from carrying heavy loads or armor. It underscores the exhaustive nature of the military effort and the hardships endured by the troops.<p><b>But he and his army received no wages from Tyre for the labor they expended on it</b><br>Despite the prolonged siege, Nebuchadnezzar did not capture the wealth of Tyre as expected. The city eventually surrendered, but the anticipated plunder was not realized. This outcome highlights the futility of human efforts without divine blessing and sets the stage for God's promise to reward Nebuchadnezzar with the spoils of Egypt instead, as mentioned in the following verses. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His control over historical events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, known for his military campaigns and the conquest of Jerusalem.

This is quite in accordance with the whole Scriptural representation of that monarch, as a man raised up to execute God's judgments. He was himself unconscious of this, and yet did that which had been foretold--a striking instance that "there is a God in history." It has been argued from this verse, and from the fact that there is no especial mention in history of the result of the siege of Tyre, that Nebuchadnezzar failed in its capture; but all that is meant is that he failed to obtain any considerable booty thereby, the Tyrians having abundant warning and opportunity to convey away their valuables by sea. This St. Jerome expressly asserts to have been done by them, and he further describes the method of the capture of the city by the same means afterwards used by Alexander, that of building a mole from the mainland to the island; thus explaining how in the besieging army "every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled" by the bearing of burdens for the structure. Berosus expressly testifies that Nebuchadnezzar "conquered all Syria and Ph?nicia" (Jos. <span class= "ital">c. Ap., </span>i. 21); and Josephus also cites Philostratus, Megasthenes, and Diocles as mentioning Nebuchadnezzar's exploits and the siege of Tyre in a way which, while they do not directly mention, yet certainly imply the capture of the city (<span class= "ital">ibid.,</span> and <span class= "ital">Antt.</span> x. 11, ? 1). Besides, it is inconceivable that Ezekiel, who long survived that siege, should have left that prophecy on record if the event was otherwise than as he predicted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadnezzar</span>, etc. The words carry us to the close of the thirteen years' siege of Tyre referred to in the notes on Ezekiel 28, and enable us to refer the commencement of that siege to the fourteenth year of Jehoiachin's captivity, circ. <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>, two years after the destruction of Jerusalem. This agrees with the report of the Tyrian Annals given by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21), who gives the names of the kings of Tyro from Ithobal to Hirom, in the fourteenth year of whose reign Cyrus became King of Persia. Josephus, however, gives the seventh, in. stead of the seventeenth, year of Nebuchadnezzar as the date of the beginning of the siege. Here the point dwelt on is not the success of the siege, but its comparative failure. The labors and sufferings of the besiegers had been immense. Jerome (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) states (not, however, giving his authority) that these labors consisted mainly in the attempt to fill up the strait between the island-city and the mainland with masses of stone and rubbish. These were carried on the heads and shoulders of the troops, and the natural result was that the former lost their hair and the latter their skin, and the whole army was in a miserable plight. And after all, the king had no <span class="cmt_word">wages</span> for his labors. The city indeed, was taken, but the inhabitants made their escape by sea, with their chief possessions, and the hopes of spoil were disappointed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;re&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5019.htm">Strong's 5019: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- 'Nebo, protect the boundary', a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Babylon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1440;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_894.htm">Strong's 894: </a> </span><span class="str2">Babylon -- an eastern Mediterranean empire and its capital city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">caused his army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#234;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
