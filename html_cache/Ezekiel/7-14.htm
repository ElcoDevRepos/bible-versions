This phrase indicates a state of readiness and urgency, suggesting that the people were aware of an impending threat. The trumpet, often a ram's horn or shofar, was used in various contexts, including religious ceremonies and military alerts (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). The preparation mentioned here implies that the people had made necessary arrangements for defense or action, yet it also highlights a sense of futility, as the subsequent phrase reveals.<p><b>but no one goes to war</b><br>Despite the preparations, there is a lack of response from the people. This could indicate a sense of fear, paralysis, or divine intervention preventing them from acting. Historically, this reflects the period of the Babylonian siege, where the people of Judah were overwhelmed and unable to mount an effective defense against their enemies (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-4</a>). Theologically, it suggests a divine judgment where human efforts are rendered ineffective, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over human affairs.<p><b>for My wrath is upon the whole multitude</b><br>This phrase underscores the reason for the inaction: the wrath of God. The "whole multitude" refers to the entire population of Judah, indicating that the judgment is comprehensive and affects everyone. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine punishment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The wrath of God is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, serving as a warning and a call to repentance (<a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and the need for salvation through Jesus Christ, who bore the wrath of God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, specifically the people of Judah who are facing impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trumpet.htm">Trumpet</a></b><br>A signal for war or assembly, symbolizing a call to action that goes unheeded in this context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wrath.htm">God's Wrath</a></b><br>The divine judgment that is being poured out on the people due to their persistent sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_readiness.htm">The Call to Readiness</a></b><br>The blowing of the trumpet signifies a call to readiness and action.
