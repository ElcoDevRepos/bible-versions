The phrase "as surely as I live" is an oath formula, underscoring the seriousness and unchangeable nature of God's words. It reflects God's eternal existence and His sovereign power to execute judgment. This is a common expression in prophetic literature, highlighting the divine authority behind the message (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you.</b><br>This is a declaration of judgment against Edom, a nation historically hostile to Israel. The term "bloodshed" signifies violence and death, indicating that Edom will face the consequences of its own violent actions. The imagery of bloodshed pursuing them suggests an inescapable retribution. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Historically, Edom's enmity with Israel is well-documented, and this prophecy aligns with the broader biblical narrative of divine justice against nations that oppose God's people (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>).<p><b>Since you did not hate bloodshed,</b><br>Edom's failure to abhor violence is highlighted here. Their complacency or even delight in violence, particularly against Israel, is condemned. This reflects a moral indictment, as they are judged not only for their actions but also for their attitudes. The biblical ethic calls for a love of justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>), and Edom's disregard for these values leads to their downfall.<p><b>it will pursue you.</b><br>The repetition of the phrase emphasizes the inevitability and persistence of the coming judgment. The pursuit of bloodshed suggests that Edom cannot escape the consequences of its actions. This mirrors the biblical theme of divine retribution, where the punishment fits the crime (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>). The relentless nature of this pursuit underscores the seriousness of their sin and the certainty of God's justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

In verse 5 the people of Mount Seir &#8220;harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword.&#8221; The conjunction makes clear that judgment is not arbitrary; it arises directly from what was done. Similar cause-and-effect language appears in <a href="/isaiah/3-11.htm">Isaiah 3:11</a> and <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>, where sin piles up &#8220;because of&#8221; hardened hearts. The Lord consistently holds nations&#8212;and individuals&#8212;accountable for how they treat His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD</b><p>God stakes His own life on the certainty of this judgment. The phrase echoes <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>, underscoring His absolute authority and the inevitability of the announced outcome. When the Lord swears by Himself (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>), the promise is ironclad; no power can overturn it. Edom&#8217;s coming reckoning is as sure as God&#8217;s own existence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will give you over to bloodshed</b><p>Here the Lord states the penalty: Edom will be handed &#8220;over to bloodshed.&#8221; The wording mirrors <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;Whoever sheds man&#8217;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed&#8221;&#8212;revealing a measured, righteous retribution. <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a> foretells the same end for Edom: &#8220;Because of violence against your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.&#8221; The principle is simple: violence begets violence when God&#8217;s moral order is violated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And it will pursue you</b><p>Bloodshed will not be a single event; it will &#8220;pursue&#8221; them. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45</a> describes curses that &#8220;will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed&#8221; when covenant terms are broken. <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> adds that &#8220;the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.&#8221; Edom cannot outrun divine justice; it will dog their steps until the sentence is fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you</b><p>The final clause repeats the threat, driving home the reason: Edom&#8217;s failure to detest violence. <a href="/proverbs/1-29.htm">Proverbs 1:29-31</a> warns that those who &#8220;hated knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;did not choose the fear of the LORD&#8221; will eat the fruit of their ways. Jesus reiterates the principle in <a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>&#8212;&#8220;all who draw the sword will die by the sword.&#8221; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a> calls it sowing and reaping: indulge sin, and its harvest comes back multiplied. By embracing bloodshed instead of abhorring it, Edom signed its own death warrant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6</a> is God&#8217;s solemn oath that the violence Edom delighted in will circle back upon them. Their ancient hatred of Israel invited a measured, unavoidable judgment, anchored in God&#8217;s own life and character. The passage reminds us that the Lord&#8217;s moral order is steadfast: love of violence invites violence, while choosing righteousness brings life (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">I will prepare thee unto blood.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">I will make thee blood.</span> There is here a play upon the name of Edom in the original: I will make thee <span class= "ital">dom</span> (<span class= "ital">=</span>blood); Edom itself means <span class= "ital">red.</span> The latter part of the verse brings out, as frequently, the congruity of the punishment: violence shall come upon him who has loved ("not hated ") violence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will prepare thee unto blood</span>. This peculiar expression was probably selected because of the suggestion of the name <span class="accented">Edom</span> ("red") contained in the term <span class="accented">dam</span> ("blood") - though Smend doubts this - and designed to intimate that Edom's name would eventually be verified in Edom's fate. <span class="cmt_word">And blood shall pursue thee</span>. "As blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and delivers him up to punishment" (Havernick), so should blood follow in the steps of Edom. The translation of Ewald, who reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, "And because thy inclination is after blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee," is hardly an improvement, and is besides unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">Sith thou hast not hated blood</span>. So render Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Schroder, Plumptre, and the Revised Version, meaning that Edom had loved bloodshed. Kimchi, Hitzig, Hengstenberg, Smend, and Fairbairn regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> as a particle of strong affirmation, equivalent to "forsooth," "verily," and understand the prophet to say that 'Edom <span class="accented">had</span> hated blood. As to the precise import of this rendering, diversity of sentiment prevails. Some, with Theodoret, explain "blood" as an allusion to the blood-relationship of Esau and Jacob, Edom and Israel, and hold the charge to be that Edom had hated his "brother" Israel. Others, with Hengstenberg, take the blood Edom hated to be the blood he had shed. Hitzig and Fairbairn suppose the sense to be that Edom hated the idea of his own blood being shed. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> - better, <span class="accented">therefore</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">blood shall pursue thee</span>. A parallel to this expression is supplied by <a href="/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22, 45</a>. According to the first or commonly accepted exposition of the preceding clause, the sense is that Edom would ultimately fall beneath the great law of retribution, and reap as she had sown - blood for blood; according to the second, the allusion is to the fact that what Edom now most dreaded, the shedding of his own blood, would be that which should ultimately overtake him (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/11-8.htm">Ezekiel 11:8</a>; <a href="/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as surely as I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">live,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will give you over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;e&#347;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
