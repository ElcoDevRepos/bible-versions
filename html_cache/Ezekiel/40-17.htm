The outer court in ancient Israelite temple architecture was a significant area where the general populace could gather, distinct from the inner courts reserved for priests. This vision occurs during the Babylonian exile, a time when the physical temple in Jerusalem had been destroyed, and thus, the vision of a new temple offered hope and restoration. The outer court symbolizes accessibility to God for all people, reflecting the inclusive nature of worship in the future messianic age.<p><b>and there were chambers and a pavement laid out all around the court</b><br>The chambers mentioned here likely served various functions, such as storage for temple supplies, housing for priests, or spaces for ritual purification. The presence of chambers indicates a well-organized and functional temple complex, emphasizing the order and holiness required in worship. The pavement signifies a prepared and consecrated space, highlighting the importance of approaching God with reverence. This detailed description underscores the meticulous nature of God's plans and the importance of sacred space in worship.<p><b>Thirty chambers faced the pavement</b><br>The specific number of thirty chambers suggests completeness and sufficiency, providing ample space for the activities and needs of the temple. This detail reflects the thoroughness of God's provision for His people.

In this prophetic structure, <a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a> explains that priests will use some chambers to eat the most holy offerings, underscoring holiness that still accommodates human service.<p>&#8226; Practical purposes include:<p>&#8211; Storage for grain, oil, and sacrifices (cf. <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Meeting places for Levites who guide worshipers (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of chambers shows God&#8217;s provision for both spiritual and logistical needs within His house.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A pavement laid out all around the court</b><p>&#8226; A paved terrace runs along the inner edge of the outer wall, forming a clear walkway.

Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that <span class="cmt_word">chambers and a pavement</span> ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> always signifying single rooms in a building (see <a href="/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; and comp. <a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see <a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see <a href="/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8-12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; <a href="/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. <a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>), which ran round the court and was named <span class="cmt_word">the lower pavement</span>, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, <span class="accented">shoulder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the gates over against</span> - or, <span class="accented">answerable to</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gates</span>. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court <span class="cmt_word">from the forefront of the lower gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, <span class="cmt_word">unto the forefront of the inner court</span> <span class="cmt_word">without was an hundred cubits</span>. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached. <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me into</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the outer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2435.htm">Strong's 2435: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, wall side, exterior, secular</span><br /><br /><span class="word">court,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
