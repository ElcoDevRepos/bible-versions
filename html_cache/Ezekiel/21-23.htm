In the historical context, the people of Judah had made alliances with Babylon, and they were relying on these political ties for security. The "false omen" suggests that the people were skeptical of Ezekiel's prophecy, viewing it as unreliable or deceptive. This skepticism is rooted in their misplaced trust in political alliances rather than in God. The concept of false omens is also seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>, where God frustrates the signs of false prophets.<p><b>but it will draw attention to their guilt</b><br>The prophecy serves to highlight the guilt of the people, particularly their idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. This is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, where the prophet often points out the spiritual adultery of Israel. The drawing of attention to their guilt is a divine act of exposing sin, similar to how Nathan confronted David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>. Theologically, this reflects God's justice and His desire for repentance and restoration.<p><b>and take them captive</b><br>The phrase foreshadows the impending Babylonian captivity, a significant event in Jewish history where many were exiled from their homeland. This captivity is a direct consequence of their disobedience and failure to heed prophetic warnings. The captivity serves as both punishment and a means of purification for the people of Israel. In a broader biblical context, captivity can be seen as a type of spiritual bondage from which Christ delivers believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, where Jesus proclaims freedom for the captives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Judah&#8217;s leaders dismiss Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s divination, but their scoffing only highlights their broken oath, and the resulting Babylonian conquest seals their guilt and carries them away. The verse reminds us that no human scheme, superstition, or skepticism can overturn God&#8217;s sure Word; His judgments expose sin and accomplish His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">As a false divination in their sight.</span>--The divination of the Babylonians seemed false to the Jews, primarily, because they were determined not to believe it; yet, doubtless, there was mingled with this a secret consciousness of the worthlessness of the idolatries which they themselves practised, and a consequent readiness to cast them aside when opposed to their wishes.<p><span class= "bld">To them that have sworn oaths.</span>--These words have been very variously interpreted, but the simplest meaning seems the best; the resolution of Nebuchadnezzar to attack Jerusalem seemed impossible to the Jews, because they were his vassals, and under oaths of fidelity to him. They must have been conscious of their own violation of those oaths, and yet have persuaded themselves that their intrigues with Egypt were not known to Nebuchadnezzar, and that therefore he would not attack them.<p><span class= "bld">But he will call to remembrance the iniquity.</span>--The pronoun is here understood by many as referring to the Lord, and "iniquity" as expressing the general sinfulness of the people. It is better to refer the pronoun <span class= "ital">to </span>Nebuchadnezzar, who will call to remembrance and punish the violation of their oaths to him. It is constantly to be remembered that Zedekiah was placed upon the throne by him under a solemn oath of fidelity to himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-3.htm" title="For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm" title="But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?">Ezekiel 17:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, &c). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The whole verse is obscure, and has been very variously interpreted. I follow the translation of the Revised Version, and explain it by inserting words which are needed to bring out its meaning: <span class="accented">It</span> (what Nebuchadnezzar has done) <span class="accented">shall be as a vain divination in their sight</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. in that of the men of Jerusalem), <span class="accented">which have sworn unto them</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. have taken oaths of fealty to the Chaldeans, and are ready to take them again), <span class="accented">but he</span> (Nebuchadnezzar) <span class="accented">brings iniquity to remembrance</span>. The fact represented is that when the people of Jerusalem heard of the divination at the parting of the ways, they still lulled themselves in a false security. They and Zedekiah had sworn obedience, and that oath would protect them. "Not so," rejoins the prophet; "the Chaldean king knows how those oaths have been kept." The LXX. omits all reference to "oaths." The Vulgate. taking the word for "oath" in its ether sense of "sabbath," gives the curious rendering, <span class="accented">Eritque quasi consulens frustra oraculum in eorum oculis, et sabbatorum otium imitans</span>. In spite of the reports that reached them, the men of Jerusalem thought themselves as safe as if the Chaldean king were keeping a sabbath day. Ewald partly follows the Vulgate, and renders, <span class="accented">They believe they have weeks on weeks</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will not believe that the danger is close at hand. Keil and Havernick: <span class="accented">Oaths of oaths are theirs</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they count on the oath of Jehovah, on his promises of protection, but he (Jehovah) brings iniquity to remembrance. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be taken</span>;
