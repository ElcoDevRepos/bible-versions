Throughout the book of Ezekiel, God frequently addresses Ezekiel as "Son of man," emphasizing his humanity and role as a representative of the people. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8220;Son of man,</b><br>The term "Son of man" is used over 90 times in the book of Ezekiel. It highlights Ezekiel's role as a human prophet among the people, contrasting with the divine nature of God. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," linking His mission to the prophetic tradition.<p><b>these bones are the whole house of Israel.</b><br>The vision of dry bones represents the entire nation of Israel, both the northern kingdom (often referred to as Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). This metaphor illustrates the spiritual and national desolation experienced by the Israelites during the Babylonian exile. The imagery of bones signifies death and hopelessness, reflecting the dire situation of the exiled community.<p><b>Look, they are saying,</b><br>This phrase introduces the lament of the people, capturing their despair and loss of hope. It reflects the collective voice of the Israelites, expressing their feelings of abandonment and desolation. This lament is a common theme in the prophetic literature, where the people's cries are often recorded to highlight their need for divine intervention.<p><b>&#8216;Our bones are dried up,</b><br>The metaphor of dried bones conveys a sense of lifelessness and despair. In the ancient Near Eastern context, bones were often associated with death and the absence of life. This imagery emphasizes the complete spiritual and national desolation of Israel, as they feel cut off from their land, their God, and their future.<p><b>and our hope has perished;</b><br>The loss of hope is a central theme in the exile experience. The Israelites believed that their covenant relationship with God was broken, and their future as a nation was in jeopardy. This phrase captures the depth of their despair, as they see no possibility of restoration or redemption. The concept of hope is crucial in biblical theology, often linked to faith in God's promises and future deliverance.<p><b>we are cut off.&#8217;</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies separation and alienation, both from God and from the land of Israel. This phrase reflects the Israelites' perception of their situation as one of complete abandonment. In the broader biblical narrative, being cut off is often associated with judgment and exile, but it also sets the stage for themes of restoration and reconciliation, as God promises to bring His people back and restore them to their land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages

Mean</div><b>Then He said to me</b><p>God takes the first step, interpreting the vision Himself instead of leaving Ezekiel to guess. This models how revelation works: the Lord speaks plainly so that His people can understand and believe (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>). Just as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22&#8211;27</a>, the prophet receives direct instruction, confirming that every detail of the vision is trustworthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Son of man,&#8221;</b><p>The familiar title reminds Ezekiel of his humanity and dependence on divine authority (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>). God speaks to an ordinary servant so that the glory remains His alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>). Throughout Scripture the Lord often addresses His messengers personally&#8212;think of Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) or Samuel in the night (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>)&#8212;underscoring intimate relationship alongside absolute sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;these bones are the whole house of Israel.&#8221;</b><p>Here God unambiguously identifies the dry bones: they represent the entire covenant nation, both northern and southern kingdoms, now scattered and apparently lifeless. Earlier promises of national restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; 36:24&#8211;28) attach to this vision, assuring that what looks dead can live again. <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a> echoes the theme: &#8220;all Israel will be saved,&#8221; grounding the future in God&#8217;s irrevocable covenant (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, they are saying,</b><p>The Lord quotes Israel&#8217;s own words, revealing He hears the despair in their hearts (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23&#8211;25</a>). Just as the psalmists pour out complaints (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>), the exiles&#8217; lament becomes part of the divine conversation. Their perspective is honest but incomplete, needing correction by God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Our bones are dried up,</b><p>&#8220;Dried&#8221; pictures utter lifelessness&#8212;no moisture, no marrow, no possibility of self-revival (<a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>). Israel felt beyond resuscitation after the Babylonian exile, temple destruction, and loss of homeland. This mirrors the sinner&#8217;s condition apart from Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and our hope has perished;</b><p>Hope, like bone marrow, sustains life; without it they see no future. <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a> warns that deferred hope makes the heart sick, and <a href="/lamentations/3-18.htm">Lamentations 3:18</a> voices the same grief: &#8220;My hope from the LORD has perished.&#8221; Yet God specializes in resurrecting dead hopes (<a href="/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we are cut off.&#8217;</b><p>They believe the covenant tie is severed&#8212;just as Adam and Eve were cut off from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). But the Lord answers later in the chapter by reuniting bones, adding flesh, breathing life, planting Israel in her own land, and declaring, &#8220;I will be their God&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>). In Christ, Gentile believers once &#8220;cut off&#8221; are grafted in (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12&#8211;13</a>), showing God&#8217;s pattern of turning alienation into reconciliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a> reveals how God hears Israel&#8217;s desolation&#8212;dry, hopeless, feeling severed&#8212;yet immediately frames their lament inside His promise of national resurrection. The verse teaches that divine interpretation of our circumstances always overrides despair. When God identifies the bones as &#8220;the whole house of Israel,&#8221; He guarantees their literal, bodily restoration, foreshadowing both Israel&#8217;s end-times revival and every believer&#8217;s future resurrection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Are the whole house of Israel.--</span>This Divine interpretation of the vision leaves no doubt of its meaning. Whatever other sense might possibly be attached to its language, there can be no uncertainty as to that which the Spirit intended. The last clause of the verse, "cut off for our parts," is obscure in the English, but in the original is simply <span class= "ital">for us</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "as for us, we are cut off."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14</span> contain, according to most commentators, the Divine interpretation of the vision, Kliefoth alone contending that they furnish, not so much an exposition of the vision - which, he thinks, must be explained independently, and which he regards as teaching the future resurrection of God's people - as an application to Israel's ease of the doctrine contained in the vision. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These bones are the whole house of Israel</span>. On the principle that "God is his own best interpreter," it should not be difficult to see that, whatever foreshadowings of the final resurrection of the just may be contained in the vision, its primary intention was to depict the political and national restoration of Israel (Ephraim and Judah) whose condition at the time the field of withered bones appropriately represented. That Hitzig errs in supposing the "bones" alluded to in this verse symbolized the portions of Ephraim and Judah then dead, instead of the portions still living (in exile), who considered themselves as practically dead, is apparent from the words that follow. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they say</span>. The complaint was manifestly taken from the popular sayings current among the people of the exile. Broken up, dispersed, expatriated, and despairing, the members of what had once been "the whole house of Israel" felt there was no hope more of recovering national life and unity. The cheerless character of the outlook they expressed by saying, Our bones (not the bones of the dead, but of the living) are dried - meaning, "The vital force of our nation is gone" (the bones being regarded in Scripture as the seat of the vital force comp. <a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">our hope is lost</span> - our hope, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of ever again returning to our own land or regaining national existence - and <span class="cmt_word">we are out off for our parts</span>;
