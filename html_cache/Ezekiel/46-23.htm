The four courts likely represent the four corners of the temple area, emphasizing the completeness and order of God's design. The number four often symbolizes universality in the Bible, suggesting the encompassing nature of God's presence and authority. This vision of the temple is part of a larger prophetic message about restoration and renewal for Israel, pointing to a future where God's people are fully restored in their relationship with Him.<p><b>was a row of masonry</b><br>The mention of masonry indicates the permanence and strength of the construction. In ancient times, masonry was a common building material for significant structures, symbolizing durability and stability. This can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging nature and the enduring nature of His covenant with His people. The use of masonry in the temple courts underscores the sacredness and importance of the temple as a place of worship and divine encounter.<p><b>with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides</b><br>The presence of ovens suggests preparation for offerings and sacrifices, which were central to the worship practices in the temple. These ovens would have been used for baking the grain offerings, a key component of the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus. This detail highlights the practical aspects of temple worship and the importance of offerings in maintaining a right relationship with God. The placement of ovens at the base of the walls signifies the integration of worship into the very structure of the temple, symbolizing how worship should be foundational in the life of God's people. This can also be seen as a type pointing to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice and fulfillment of the sacrificial system, providing a way for believers to be reconciled to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
