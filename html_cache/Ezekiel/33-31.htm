This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where the Israelites would seek prophetic guidance during times of crisis or uncertainty. The phrase "as usual" implies a superficial engagement, highlighting a disconnect between their actions and their intentions. Historically, this period was marked by the Babylonian exile, a time when the Israelites were seeking answers and hope.<p><b>sit before you</b><br>Sitting before a prophet was a sign of respect and a desire to learn, similar to how disciples would sit at the feet of their teacher. This posture indicates a willingness to listen, yet the context reveals a lack of genuine commitment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sitting was also a position of judgment, suggesting that the people were evaluating Ezekiel's words rather than submitting to them.<p><b>and hear your words</b><br>Hearing in the biblical sense often implies obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema calls for Israel to "hear" and obey. However, the subsequent context in Ezekiel reveals a disconnect between hearing and doing. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people are called to be doers of the word, not just hearers (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><b>but they do not put them into practice</b><br>This highlights the central issue of hypocrisy and disobedience. The Israelites' failure to act on God's words is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where God desires obedience over sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of living out one's faith, a principle echoed by Jesus in the parable of the two sons (<a href="/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28-32</a>).<p><b>Although they express love with their mouths</b><br>This phrase points to the superficiality of the people's devotion. It echoes <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God laments that the people honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. This lip service is contrasted with the genuine love and obedience that God desires, as seen in the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>their hearts pursue dishonest gain</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being and intentions. Here, the heart's pursuit of dishonest gain reveals the true motivations of the people. This pursuit of material wealth and self-interest is condemned throughout Scripture, as in the warnings against greed and the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The contrast between outward expressions and inward motivations is a key theme in Jesus' teachings, particularly in His rebukes of the Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to be a watchman for the house of Israel, delivering God's messages to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, often characterized by their disobedience and hard-heartedness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate speaker through Ezekiel, expressing His disappointment with the people's insincere worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective nation of Israel, often used to denote their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watchman.htm">The Watchman</a></b><br>A metaphor for Ezekiel's role, emphasizing his responsibility to warn the people of impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_lip_service.htm">The Danger of Lip Service</a></b><br>It's easy to profess faith with our mouths while our hearts are far from God.
