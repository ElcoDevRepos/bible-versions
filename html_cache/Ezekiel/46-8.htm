In the context of Ezekiel's vision, the prince is a significant figure in the restored temple worship. This prince is not the Messiah but a leader who plays a role in the temple's administration. The prince's entrance signifies his authority and responsibility in worship, reflecting the order and reverence required in the temple.<p><b>he shall go in through the portico of the gateway</b><br>The portico, or vestibule, of the gateway is a specific architectural feature of the temple described in Ezekiel's vision. This entrance is reserved for the prince, indicating a special status and function. The gateway's design reflects the sacredness and order of worship, emphasizing the separation between the holy and the common. The prince's use of this entrance underscores his unique role in leading the people in worship.<p><b>and he shall go out the same way</b><br>The instruction for the prince to exit the same way he entered highlights the orderliness and reverence required in temple worship. This practice ensures that the prince's movements are deliberate and respectful, maintaining the sanctity of the temple. It also symbolizes consistency and faithfulness in leadership, as the prince's actions are to be predictable and aligned with God's commands. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of walking in God's ways and the importance of obedience in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Ezekiel 46</a>, the prince is a central figure in the temple worship.
