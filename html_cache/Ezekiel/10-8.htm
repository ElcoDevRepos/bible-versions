They are often seen as guardians of divine holiness, as in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life. Their appearance in Ezekiel's vision underscores the majesty and mystery of God's throne.<br><br>*to have the form of human hands*: The presence of human hands suggests the capability for action and interaction with the physical world. This detail emphasizes the cherubim's role in executing God's will, as hands are often symbolic of power and agency in biblical literature. The human form also indicates a connection between the divine and human realms, reflecting the image of God in humanity (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<br><br>*under their wings*: Wings in biblical imagery often symbolize swiftness, protection, and the ability to transcend earthly limitations. The placement of hands under the wings may suggest that divine actions are carried out with both power and care, hidden yet effective. This imagery can be connected to the protective nature of God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God covers His people with His feathers and provides refuge under His wings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the visions from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The setting of Ezekiel's vision, representing the dwelling place of God's glory and the center of Israel's worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Ezekiel's vision of God's glory departing from the temple, symbolizing judgment and the impending destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's ministry, where the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>The presence of cherubim in Ezekiel's vision underscores the holiness and majesty of God.

The prophet struggles, as before, to relate what he has actually seen in the visions of God. The fact is stated as explaining the mention of the "hand" in ver. 7. That, as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>, was one of their members (see notes on Ezekiel 1:15-17). All that had seemed most startling and awful to him on the banks of Chebar is now seen again - the four living creatures, now named cherubim the wheel by each, the unswerving motion of the wheels in their onward course. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(The cherubim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lak&#183;k&#601;&#183;ru&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3742.htm">Strong's 3742: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably an order of angelic beings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">appeared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to have the form</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#7687;&#183;n&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8403.htm">Strong's 8403: </a> </span><span class="str2">Structure, a model, resemblance</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of human</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">under</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8478.htm">Strong's 8478: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bottom, below, in lieu of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their wings.)</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1508;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(kan&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3671.htm">Strong's 3671: </a> </span><span class="str2">An edge, extremity, a wing, a flap, a quarter, a pinnacle</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/10-8.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 10:8 There appeared in the cherubim the form (Ezek.
