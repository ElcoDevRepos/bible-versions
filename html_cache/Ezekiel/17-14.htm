Historically, this occurred when Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded Judah, leading to the exile of its people. The kingdom's reduction in power and prestige was a direct consequence of its disobedience to God. This humbling is consistent with the biblical theme that pride precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Theologically, it serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the consequences of turning away from His commandments.<p><b>unable to lift itself up</b><br>Judah's inability to restore itself highlights its dependence on God for deliverance and restoration. This reflects the broader biblical narrative that human strength and wisdom are insufficient without divine intervention (<a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>). The kingdom's powerlessness is a metaphor for spiritual helplessness without God's aid, paralleling the New Testament teaching that apart from Christ, believers can do nothing (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><b>surviving only by keeping his covenant</b><br>The covenant here refers to the agreement between Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, and Nebuchadnezzar, which was broken by Zedekiah's rebellion. Biblically, covenants are central to God's relationship with His people, and breaking them leads to dire consequences. This phrase underscores the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God's commands. It also foreshadows the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where survival and eternal life are promised to those who remain faithful to Him (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using symbolic language and parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_judah.htm">The Kingdom of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was under threat and eventually fell to Babylon due to its disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah, representing God's instrument of judgment against His people for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who broke his covenant with Babylon, leading to the kingdom's downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>Refers to the agreement between Zedekiah and Babylon, which he violated, symbolizing Judah's broader failure to keep its covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's people are called to be faithful to their covenants, both with Him and with others.

The first eagle pictures Babylon&#8217;s king, who removed Judah&#8217;s king Jehoiachin and set Zedekiah on the throne (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a>). Zedekiah then broke his oath to Babylon and turned to Egypt for help instead (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>). Through the prophet, God explains why He allowed Babylon to dominate Judah: &#8220;so that the kingdom would be brought low&#8212;unable to lift itself up&#8212;and would survive by keeping his covenant&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/17-14.htm">Ezekiel 17:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That the kingdom would be brought low</b><p>&#8226; God ordained Babylon&#8217;s domination to humble Judah. Pride had led the nation into idolatry and injustice (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; A reduced, vassal state would expose Judah&#8217;s need for the Lord rather than political alliances (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;brought low&#8221; was not merely punishment; it was discipline intended to draw the people back to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unable to lift itself up</b><p>&#8226; Judah had no military strength to overthrow Babylon. The Lord made sure &#8220;the arm of Pharaoh&#8221; could not save them (<a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their helplessness was a vivid reminder that &#8220;a king is not saved by his great army&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; God often allows circumstances where self-rescue is impossible, so His people learn to rely on Him alone (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Any attempt to &#8220;lift itself up&#8221; by breaking sworn commitments would only deepen judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But survive only by keeping his covenant</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;His covenant&#8221; refers first to Zedekiah&#8217;s sworn oath of loyalty to Babylon&#8217;s king (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>). God expected Judah to honor that oath because it was made in His name (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to this treaty was the single path to survival; rebellion guaranteed destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>).<p>&#8226; More deeply, the Lord was urging His people to return to the covenant at Sinai&#8212;the life-giving relationship of obedience and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-39.htm">Deuteronomy 4:39&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, believers today find the new and better covenant that grants life when we submit to His lordship (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). The principle remains: life is preserved through covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-14.htm">Ezekiel 17:14</a> teaches that God purposefully humbled Judah, stripping away every source of pride so the nation could not rescue itself. Their only hope of survival lay in honoring the covenant commitments they had made&#8212;both the political oath to Babylon and, more importantly, their spiritual covenant with the Lord. The verse underscores a timeless truth: God opposes self-reliant pride but gives sustaining grace to those who humbly keep His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">That the kingdom might be base.</span>--(See the Notes on <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm" title="And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.">Ezekiel 17:6</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">so that the kingdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mam&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4467.htm">Strong's 4467: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kingdom, sovereignty, dominion, reign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">would be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lih&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
