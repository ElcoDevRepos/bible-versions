It suggests a transformation so significant that it prompts a verbal response. The context is a prophetic vision given to Ezekiel, where God promises restoration to the land of Israel. This acknowledgment by others highlights the public and undeniable nature of God's work.<p><b>&#8216;This land that was desolate</b><br>The land referred to is Israel, which had experienced devastation due to the Babylonian exile. Historically, the land was left barren and neglected, symbolizing the spiritual desolation of the people. The desolation serves as a backdrop for the miraculous transformation that God promises.<p><b>has become like the garden of Eden.</b><br>The comparison to the Garden of Eden signifies a return to a state of perfection, abundance, and divine blessing. The Garden of Eden is a biblical symbol of paradise and God's original intent for creation. This transformation implies not only physical restoration but also spiritual renewal, echoing themes of redemption and new creation found throughout scripture.<p><b>The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of the destruction that had occurred. The cities of Israel, including Jerusalem, had been laid waste by invading armies. The repetition of terms underscores the complete devastation and the hopelessness of the situation from a human perspective.<p><b>are now fortified and inhabited.&#8217;</b><br>The transformation from ruin to fortification and habitation indicates security, stability, and community. Fortified cities suggest protection and strength, while being inhabited implies life and vibrancy. This restoration is a fulfillment of God's promises to His people, reflecting His faithfulness and power. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration and protection found in the Kingdom of God, as seen in prophetic literature and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
