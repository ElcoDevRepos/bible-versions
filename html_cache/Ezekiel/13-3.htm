In the prophetic tradition, the phrase "Thus says the Lord" is a common introduction, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet's own imagination but from God Himself. This establishes the seriousness and authenticity of the prophecy. It is a reminder of the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8-9</a>.<p><b>Woe to the foolish prophets:</b><br>"Woe" is a term often used in prophetic literature to pronounce judgment or lamentation. It indicates impending doom or divine displeasure. The term "foolish" here refers to those lacking wisdom and discernment, particularly in spiritual matters. In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). These prophets are contrasted with true prophets who speak God's truth. The foolishness of these prophets is highlighted in their failure to deliver God's true message, similar to the false prophets criticized in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>.<p><b>who follow their own spirit:</b><br>This phrase indicates that these prophets are not led by the Spirit of God but by their own desires and imaginations. In biblical terms, following one's own spirit often leads to idolatry and falsehood, as seen in the warnings against false prophets in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>. The true prophet is one who is led by the Holy Spirit, as exemplified by prophets like Elijah and Elisha. This self-led spirit contrasts with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which is a key theme in both the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>yet have seen nothing:</b><br>The phrase underscores the falsehood of their claims to visions or divine revelations. In the biblical context, true prophets receive visions and messages directly from God, as seen in the experiences of Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and Daniel (Daniel 7). The false prophets' lack of true vision is a significant indictment, as it reveals their deception and the emptiness of their proclamations. This lack of true vision is a recurring theme in the critique of false prophets, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>, where false visions lead people astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foolish_prophets.htm">Foolish Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals claiming to speak for God but who are actually following their own imaginations and desires.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and ultimate authority, who speaks through Ezekiel to address the false prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, currently in a state of spiritual and physical exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment to distinguish between true and false prophets.
