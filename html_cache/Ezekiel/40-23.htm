The north gate's mention is significant as it aligns with the temple's symmetrical design, reflecting divine order. In biblical symbolism, the north often represents judgment or God's throne (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). The gates signify access to God, and their placement underscores the temple's role as a meeting place between God and His people.<p><b>just as there was on the east</b><br>The east gate is traditionally associated with the coming of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>, where the glory of God enters the temple from the east. This orientation is significant in biblical prophecy and eschatology, as the east is often linked to the Messiah's return (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>). The parallel between the north and east gates emphasizes the temple's comprehensive accessibility and the universality of God's invitation to worship.<p><b>He measured the distance from gateway to gateway to be a hundred cubits</b><br>The act of measuring signifies God's precise plan and order, as seen throughout Ezekiel's vision. A hundred cubits, approximately 150 feet, indicates the temple's grand scale and the importance of exactness in divine architecture. This measurement reflects the temple's symmetry and balance, symbolizing God's perfection and holiness. The detailed measurements in Ezekiel's vision foreshadow the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His eternal kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where the New Jerusalem is also meticulously measured.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
