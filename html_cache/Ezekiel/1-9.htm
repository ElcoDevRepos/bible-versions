In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this represents the harmonious operation of God's divine will. The cherubim, often associated with God's presence and holiness, are depicted in a way that emphasizes their interconnectedness, suggesting the seamless execution of God's purposes. This unity can be seen as a reflection of the divine order and the perfect cooperation within the heavenly realm. The touching wings also echo the design of the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), symbolizing God's throne and His presence among His people.<p><b>They did not turn as they moved;</b><br>This phrase highlights the unwavering focus and determination of the living creatures. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such imagery would convey strength and purpose. The creatures' ability to move without turning suggests an omnidirectional capability, symbolizing God's omnipresence and omniscience. This characteristic can be linked to the nature of God, who is unchanging and steadfast in His plans (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The imagery also serves as a reminder of the divine guidance that does not waver or deviate, reflecting the constancy of God's will.<p><b>each one went straight ahead.</b><br>The straightforward movement of each creature signifies directness and intentionality. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the path of righteousness and the unwavering pursuit of God's purposes. In biblical symbolism, going "straight ahead" often represents moral integrity and adherence to God's commands (<a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>). The creatures' movement without deviation underscores the idea of divine direction and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who set His face toward Jerusalem and the cross, unwavering in His mission to fulfill the Father's will (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The joining of the extremities of the outstretched wings of the cherubim recalls the arrangement in Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-27.htm" title="And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.">1Kings 6:27</a>), in which the wings of the larger cherubim touched one another above the mercy-seat.<p><span class= "bld">They turned not when they went.</span>--Whichever way they wished to go, they could still go "straight forward," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the direction towards which they looked, since they looked in all directions, and their round feet made it equally easy to move in any way.
