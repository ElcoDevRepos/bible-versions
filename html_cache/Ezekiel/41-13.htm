The measurement of a hundred cubits reflects the grandeur and significance of the temple structure. In biblical terms, a cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the temple about 150 feet long. This measurement emphasizes the temple's importance as a place of worship and God's dwelling among His people. The temple's dimensions can be seen as a reflection of God's perfection and completeness, as the number ten (a factor of one hundred) often symbolizes completeness in Scripture. This measurement also connects to the vision of the new temple in Ezekiel, which is distinct from Solomon's temple and the second temple, indicating a future, eschatological fulfillment.<p><b>and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long</b><br>The inclusion of the temple courtyard and the building with its walls in the measurement highlights the comprehensive nature of the vision. The courtyard was an essential part of the temple complex, serving as a place for the congregation of Israel to gather and participate in worship. The uniformity in measurement suggests a harmonious and unified design, reflecting God's desire for order and unity among His people. The walls symbolize protection and separation from the profane, indicating the holiness required in approaching God.
