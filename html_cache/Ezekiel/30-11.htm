Historically, Nebuchadnezzar was known for his military prowess and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His campaigns were often brutal, and he was a key figure in the fulfillment of God's judgment against various nations, including Egypt. The mention of "his people" indicates the collective force of the Babylonian army, which was composed of various groups and mercenaries from conquered territories.<p><b>the most ruthless of the nations</b><br>Babylon is described as "the most ruthless of the nations," highlighting their reputation for cruelty and efficiency in warfare. This description aligns with other biblical references to Babylon's might and ferocity, such as in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-7</a>, where the Chaldeans are depicted as a bitter and hasty nation. The Babylonians were feared across the ancient Near East for their military tactics and the harsh treatment of their enemies.<p><b>will be brought in to destroy the land</b><br>This phrase indicates divine orchestration, as God uses Babylon as an instrument of judgment against Egypt. The destruction of the land signifies a comprehensive devastation, affecting not only the military but also the economic and social structures of Egypt. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations to execute His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria.<p><b>They will draw their swords against Egypt</b><br>The imagery of drawing swords signifies preparation for battle and the imminent threat of warfare. Egypt, a powerful and influential nation, is now the target of Babylon's military campaign. This reflects the historical context of the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC, when Egypt was a significant power but faced challenges from rising empires like Babylon.<p><b>and fill the land with the slain</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the impending judgment, with widespread death and destruction. The filling of the land with the slain indicates not only military defeat but also a profound loss of life, affecting the entire nation. This echoes other prophetic warnings of judgment, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>, where the day of the Lord's vengeance is described as a day of slaughter. The imagery serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/he_and_his_army.htm">He and His Army</a></b><br>Refers to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and his forces.
