In ancient Israel, the poor were often vulnerable to exploitation. The Law, as given in the Torah, repeatedly commands care for the poor, widows, and orphans (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). This reflects God's character as a defender of the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). The righteous man, therefore, is one who actively chooses not to exploit or harm those who are economically disadvantaged, aligning with the broader biblical theme of social justice.<p><b>and takes no interest or usury</b><br>Charging interest or usury on loans to fellow Israelites was prohibited under Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>). This was to prevent the rich from exploiting the poor, ensuring that community relationships were based on mutual support rather than financial gain. In the ancient Near East, usury was common, but Israel was called to be distinct in its economic practices, reflecting God's justice and compassion. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to lend without expecting repayment (<a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>).<p><b>He keeps My ordinances and follows My statutes</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands as a hallmark of righteousness. The ordinances and statutes refer to the comprehensive body of laws given to Israel, covering moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of life. Obedience to these laws was a sign of covenant faithfulness and a way to maintain a right relationship with God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the Law, and believers are called to live by the Spirit, which upholds the righteous requirements of the Law (<a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>).<p><b>Such a man will not die for his father&#8217;s iniquity</b><br>This statement highlights the principle of individual responsibility before God. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>, God is correcting a misunderstanding among the Israelites who believed they were suffering for the sins of their ancestors. This principle is consistent with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that individuals are accountable for their own sins. It reflects God's justice and fairness, ensuring that each person is judged based on their own actions rather than the actions of their forebears.<p><b>He will surely live</b><br>The promise of life here is both physical and spiritual. In the Old Testament context, it often referred to a long and prosperous life in the land of Israel, a blessing for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). Spiritually, it points to the ultimate life found in relationship with God. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The assurance of life is a central theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's desire for His people to experience fullness of life through obedience and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_man.htm">The Righteous Man</a></b><br>The individual described in this verse who chooses to live according to God's statutes, demonstrating personal responsibility and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Those who are vulnerable and often exploited, whom the righteous man protects by withholding harm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents the previous generation whose sins do not determine the fate of the righteous son, emphasizing individual accountability.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_ordinances_and_statutes.htm">God's Ordinances and Statutes</a></b><br>The divine laws and commands given by God, which the righteous man follows, ensuring his life and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and choices.

Life in Scripture is more than breath; it is flourishing under God&#8217;s favor, now and forever.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a> echoes Ezekiel: &#8220;Whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life&#8230; he has crossed over from death to life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> sets the contrast starkly&#8212;sin pays wages of death, &#8220;but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;<p>Obedience does not earn life; it evidences a heart that trusts the Life-Giver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a> sketches a portrait of the righteous: compassionate toward the poor, financially fair, devoted to God&#8217;s commands, and consistently walking in His ways. Such a person is not chained to the sins of ancestors but enjoys God&#8217;s promised life. The verse calls us to hands that protect, wallets that bless, minds that treasure God&#8217;s ordinances, and feet that keep pace with His statutes&#8212;confident that in Christ we &#8220;will surely live.&#8221;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He withholds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
