In the context of Ezekiel, God is speaking about the Levites who had previously gone astray. Despite their past unfaithfulness, God is showing mercy by assigning them a role in the temple. This reflects God's grace and the principle of restoration, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It also highlights the sovereignty of God in choosing and appointing individuals for His purposes, similar to how He appointed prophets and leaders throughout Israel's history.<p><b>to keep charge of all the work for the temple</b><br>The Levites are given the responsibility of overseeing the work of the temple. This role is significant as it involves maintaining the sanctity and order of the temple services. Historically, the Levites were set apart for service to God, as seen in <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>, where they were given duties related to the tabernacle. This appointment underscores the importance of worship and the need for dedicated individuals to ensure that the temple functions according to God's commands. It also serves as a reminder of the need for faithfulness in service, as the Levites' previous unfaithfulness had consequences.<p><b>and everything to be done in it</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the Levites' responsibilities. They are tasked with all aspects of temple work, which would include cleaning, preparing sacrifices, and assisting the priests. This comprehensive duty reflects the holistic nature of worship in the Old Testament, where every detail mattered to God. It also points to the meticulous care required in serving God, as seen in the detailed instructions for temple worship in books like Leviticus. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills all aspects of the law and temple worship, serving as the ultimate High Priest and perfect sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
