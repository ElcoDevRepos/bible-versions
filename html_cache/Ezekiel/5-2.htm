Historically, the siege of Jerusalem by Babylon culminated in 586 BC, leading to the city's destruction. The "days of the siege" symbolize a period of divine judgment and punishment for the nation's sins, as prophesied by Ezekiel and other prophets like Jeremiah.<p><b>you are to burn up a third of the hair inside the city</b><br>The burning of a third of the hair signifies the destruction and death that would occur within Jerusalem. Hair, in this context, represents the people of Jerusalem. The act of burning symbolizes the consuming fire of God's judgment, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/lamentations/4-11.htm">Lamentations 4:11</a>, where God's wrath is described as a fire. This act foreshadows the burning of the city by the Babylonians.<p><b>you are also to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city</b><br>Slashing the hair with a sword represents those who would fall by the sword during the Babylonian conquest. The sword is a common biblical symbol of war and divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>). This act illustrates the widespread death and destruction that would occur outside the city walls, as the Babylonians pursued and killed those who attempted to flee.<p><b>and you are to scatter a third to the wind</b><br>Scattering the hair to the wind symbolizes the dispersion of the Jewish people into exile. This dispersion fulfills the warnings given by Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> about the consequences of disobedience. The scattering also prefigures the Jewish diaspora, which would have significant theological implications for the identity and future of Israel.<p><b>For I will unleash a sword behind them</b><br>This phrase indicates that even in exile, the people would not escape God's judgment. The "sword" represents ongoing divine retribution and the continued threat of violence and persecution. This reflects the persistent theme in prophetic literature that God's judgment follows disobedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, where God warns of scattering and the sword. This also serves as a reminder of the need for repentance and return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under siege, representing the center of Jewish life and worship, which is facing divine judgment due to the people's disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_siege.htm">The Siege</a></b><br>A symbolic act commanded by God to Ezekiel, representing the impending destruction and judgment upon Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hair.htm">The Hair</a></b><br>Represents the people of Jerusalem, divided into thirds to symbolize different fates for the inhabitants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's judgment and the means by which He will execute His justice upon the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The division of the hair and the subsequent actions illustrate the severe consequences of sin and disobedience to God.

God times judgment precisely. The &#8220;days&#8221; are set by Him; when they conclude, the consequences begin to unfold&#8212;showing that history obeys His calendar, not human schedules (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Burn up a third of the hair inside the city</b><p>&#8226; Hair represents the inhabitants (<a href="/ezekiel/5-4.htm">Ezekiel 5:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire inside the model city pictures plague, famine, and internal strife consuming people trapped within the walls: &#8220;A third of your people will die by plague or perish in famine inside you&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>; cp. <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The burning also mirrors the literal torching of Jerusalem eleven years later (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>).

As God earlier warned, &#8220;I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out a sword after you&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s reach will hunt the refugees, and subsequent empires will keep the pressure on (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The image underscores divine sovereignty: the same Lord who permits scattering also directs history&#8217;s sword until His people repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ezekiel&#8217;s shaved hair becomes a living chart of Jerusalem&#8217;s fate:<p>&#8226; One third consumed inside the city&#8212;famine, disease, and fire.<p>&#8226; One third slain by the sword in direct combat.<p>&#8226; One third driven into exile, still shadowed by God&#8217;s pursuing judgment.<p>The verse teaches that God&#8217;s warnings are literal, His timing exact, and His purposes redemptive&#8212;pressing His people toward repentance and ultimately toward the hope of restoration promised later in the book.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Burn with fire a third art in the midst of the city.</span>--It is better to suppose this done only in description than to imagine that the prophet carried it out in act upon the tile on which the city (Jerusalem) was portrayed. The meaning of this verse is explained in <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, and is made plainer by translating the same word uniformly "sword," instead of changing to "knife." The third, which is scattered, plainly signifies the small part of the people who, escaping destruction, shall be scattered among the heathen. A similar prophecy, referring however to a later time, may be found in <a href="/context/zechariah/13-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, said the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.">Zechariah 13:8-9</a>. The expression, "when the days of the siege are fulfilled," of course refers to the symbolic siege of the prophet. The words, "I will draw out a sword after them," are taken from <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.">Leviticus 26:33</a>, and are repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, and again in <a href="/ezekiel/12-14.htm" title="And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.">Ezekiel 12:14</a>. The suffering from the Divine judgments should still follow them in their exile. Plain prophecy is here mixed with the symbolism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt burn with fire,</span> etc. The symbolism receives its interpretation in ver. 12. A third part of the people (we need not expect numerical exactness) was to perish in the city of pestilence and famine, another to fall by the sword in their attempts to escape, yet another third was to be scattered to the far off land of their exile, and even there the sword was to follow them. The words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the city,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the days of the siege</span>, find their most natural explanation in <a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1, 5, 6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the siege</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
