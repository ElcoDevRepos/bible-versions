It reflects the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, where God warns Israel of the dire outcomes of breaking the covenant. Historically, such events occurred during sieges, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a> during the siege of Samaria. This cannibalism is not just a physical act but symbolizes the complete breakdown of societal and familial structures due to sin and rebellion. It serves as a vivid illustration of the depth of desperation and judgment that would come upon Jerusalem.<p><b>I will execute judgments against you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's role as the righteous judge. The judgments are a direct response to the idolatry and abominations committed by the people of Jerusalem. It reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings follow obedience, and curses follow disobedience. The execution of judgments is consistent with God's character as just and holy, ensuring that sin is addressed.
