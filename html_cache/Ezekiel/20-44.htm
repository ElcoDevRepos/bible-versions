The phrase "you will know" suggests a future realization or acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel often struggled with idolatry and disobedience, leading to periods of exile and judgment. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, as Israel witnesses God's actions and character.<p><b>that I am the LORD,</b><br>The declaration "I am the LORD" is a recurring theme in the Bible, underscoring God's unique identity and authority. It echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," signifying God's eternal, self-existent nature. This statement serves as a reminder of God's covenant relationship with Israel and His ultimate authority over all creation.<p><b>when I have dealt with you for the sake of My name</b><br>God's actions are motivated by the sanctity of His name, which represents His character and reputation. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it conveyed the essence of a person's identity. God's dealings with Israel are not based on their merit but on His commitment to uphold His holy name. This reflects the theme of God's grace and mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>, where God acts for His name's sake to prevent it from being profaned among the nations.<p><b>and not according to your wicked ways and corrupt acts,</b><br>This phrase highlights the contrast between God's righteousness and Israel's sinfulness. Despite Israel's persistent rebellion and idolatry, God chooses to act out of His own character rather than in response to their deeds. This underscores the concept of divine grace, where God extends mercy and forgiveness not based on human actions but on His own purposes and promises. It also serves as a warning and call to repentance, reminding Israel of their need to turn from sin.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "declares the Lord GOD" affirms the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) combines titles that emphasize both God's sovereign rule and His covenantal relationship with Israel. This declaration assures the fulfillment of God's promises and judgments, reinforcing the trustworthiness of His word. Throughout the prophetic literature, such declarations serve to authenticate the message as divinely inspired and authoritative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective people of Israel, who were in rebellion against God and were experiencing His judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_god.htm">The Name of God</a></b><br>Represents God's character and reputation, which He upholds for His glory and the benefit of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>God acts according to His sovereign will and mercy, not based on human merit.
