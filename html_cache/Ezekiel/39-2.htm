In the context of Ezekiel, God is addressing Gog, a leader of a coalition of nations. The turning around suggests a redirection of plans, emphasizing that even powerful leaders are subject to God's will. This reflects the biblical theme of God's authority over nations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>drive you along</b><br>Here, the imagery of being driven along suggests compulsion and inevitability. It implies that Gog's actions are not entirely of his own volition but are orchestrated by God. This aligns with the biblical narrative where God uses nations to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>, where Assyria is used as an instrument of judgment.<p><b>bring you up from the far north</b><br>The "far north" is often associated with regions beyond Israel's immediate neighbors, possibly referring to areas like modern-day Russia or Turkey. Historically, invaders often came from the north, making it a symbol of threat. This geographical reference underscores the prophecy's scope, involving distant nations. It also connects to other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>, where disaster is prophesied to come from the north.<p><b>and send you against the mountains of Israel</b><br>The mountains of Israel are significant both geographically and theologically. They represent the heart of the Promised Land, a place of divine promise and covenant. This phrase indicates a direct confrontation with God's chosen people, echoing previous invasions and conflicts in Israel's history. Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's plans for Israel, as seen in the eschatological visions of <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8-9</a>, where nations gather against God's people but are ultimately defeated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is speaking and orchestrating the events described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or symbolic figure representing forces opposed to God, often associated with end-times prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_north.htm">The Far North</a></b><br>A geographical reference indicating the origin of Gog's forces, often interpreted as regions north of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_israel.htm">Mountains of Israel</a></b><br>The location where the confrontation with Gog's forces will occur, symbolizing God's chosen land and people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a conduit for divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the movements of nations.

To Ezekiel&#8217;s listeners, armies threatening Israel often streamed from that direction (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; 6:22).<p>&#8226; The detail is geographic and literal, yet its theological weight is heavier: no distance or power base lies outside God&#8217;s reach.<p>&#8226; Repeated emphasis on the north throughout Ezekiel signals a coordinated, end-time invasion that God Himself foretells and supervises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>send you against the mountains of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The destination is specific: Israel&#8217;s rugged highlands, long symbolic of covenant land (<a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>; 36:1).<p>&#8226; God &#8220;sends&#8221; Gog&#8212;He is not merely permitting but commissioning the march.<p>&#8226; Purpose statements that follow show two aims:<p>&#8211; Judgment on the invaders (<a href="/ezekiel/39-4.htm">Ezekiel 39:4</a>: &#8220;You will fall on the mountains of Israel&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Vindication of God&#8217;s name before all nations (<a href="/zechariah/12-9.htm">Zechariah 12:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The mountains where enemies gather will also be the stage where the LORD delivers His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a> reveals a four-step sequence directed entirely by God: He turns, drives, brings, and sends Gog.

The passage reassures believers that end-time threats, no matter how formidable or distant, unfold under God&#8217;s precise authority and ultimately serve to exalt His holy name before Israel and the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Leave but the sixth part of thee</span>.--This word occurs only here, and the translation is based on the supposition that it is derived from the word meaning <span class= "ital">six;</span> but even on this supposition the renderings in the margin are as likely to be right as that of the text. This derivation, however, is probably wrong; all the ancient versions give a sense corresponding to <a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm" title="And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armor, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:">Ezekiel 38:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>, and also to the clauses immediately before and after, "I will lead thee along."

The former derivation has been followed by the Authorized Version, which renders in the margin, "I will strike thee with six plagues," or "draw thee back with a hook of six teeth," and by Hengstenberg, With whom Plumptre agrees, "1 will six thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "afflict thee with six plagues," viz. those mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>.
