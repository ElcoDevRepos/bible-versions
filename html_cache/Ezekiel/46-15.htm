The lamb is a common sacrificial animal in the Old Testament, symbolizing innocence and purity. This practice is rooted in the Mosaic Law, where a lamb was offered daily as part of the morning and evening sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). The lamb also foreshadows Jesus Christ, referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, who takes away the sin of the world.<p><b>the grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute offering made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (Leviticus 2). It represents the fruits of human labor and dedication to God. In the context of Ezekiel, it signifies the people's devotion and acknowledgment of God's provision. The grain offering complements the burnt offering, symbolizing the worshiper's complete surrender to God.<p><b>and the oil</b><br>Oil in biblical times was a valuable commodity, used for anointing, cooking, and as fuel for lamps. In the sacrificial system, oil was mixed with the grain offering, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's presence and the richness of God's blessings. The inclusion of oil in the offering underscores the importance of the Spirit's role in worship and dedication to God.<p><b>every morning</b><br>The phrase "every morning" indicates the regularity and consistency of worship and devotion required by God. This daily offering reflects the Israelites' dependence on God and their commitment to maintaining a relationship with Him. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and mercy, renewed each day (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><b>as a regular burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah," was a sacrifice that was completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God. It was a key component of the sacrificial system, representing atonement and reconciliation with God (Leviticus 1). In Ezekiel's vision, the regular burnt offering signifies the restored relationship between God and His people, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who received visions and messages from God concerning the future of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader mentioned in Ezekiel's vision, often interpreted as a messianic figure or a representative of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerings.htm">The Offerings</a></b><br>The lamb, grain offering, and oil represent daily sacrifices made to God, signifying devotion and atonement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath_and_new_moon.htm">The Sabbath and New Moon</a></b><br>Specific times mentioned in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Ezekiel 46</a> for additional worship and offerings, highlighting the importance of regular worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_worship.htm">Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>Just as the offerings were made every morning, believers are called to maintain a consistent and daily practice of worship and devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The offerings symbolize dedication and atonement, reminding us of the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus and our call to live sacrificially.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discipline.htm">Spiritual Discipline</a></b><br>Regular offerings highlight the importance of spiritual discipline in our lives, encouraging us to prioritize our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_leadership.htm">Community and Leadership</a></b><br>The role of the prince in facilitating worship underscores the importance of godly leadership and community in spiritual practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_in_christ.htm">Fulfillment in Christ</a></b><br>The daily offerings point to the fulfillment of the law in Christ, who is our perfect and eternal sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_46_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 46:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_15_Daily_offerings_value.htm">How does Ezekiel 46:15 emphasize the importance of daily offerings to God?
