The context is a prophetic vision given to Ezekiel concerning a time after a great battle. The cities of Israel refer to the populated areas within the nation, suggesting a collective movement of the people. Historically, Israel's cities were often fortified and central to community life, serving as places of refuge and governance.<p><b>kindle fires, and burn up the weapons</b><br>The act of kindling fires and burning weapons symbolizes the aftermath of a significant military victory. In ancient times, burning the enemy's weapons was a way to prevent their reuse and to signify total defeat. This imagery also suggests a period of peace, as the weapons are no longer needed for defense. Theologically, it points to God's deliverance and the futility of human warfare against divine intervention.<p><b>the bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears</b><br>These items represent the typical armaments of ancient warfare. Bucklers and shields were used for protection, while bows, arrows, clubs, and spears were offensive weapons. The comprehensive list underscores the totality of the enemy's defeat. In a broader biblical context, these weapons can be seen as symbols of human reliance on military might, which is ultimately powerless against God's sovereignty.<p><b>For seven years they will use them for fuel</b><br>The duration of seven years is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or divine perfection. Using the weapons for fuel for such an extended period emphasizes the abundance of the spoils and the thoroughness of the victory. This period of using weapons as fuel also suggests a time of sustained peace and provision, as the people of Israel rely on the remnants of their enemies for warmth and energy, rather than engaging in further conflict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The citizens are not hiding in fortified strongholds; they are &#8220;dwelling securely&#8221; just as <a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a> foretold. Similar promises of renewed settlement appear in <a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-10.htm">Ezekiel 36:10-12</a>, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to bring His people home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will go out</b><p>Instead of remaining behind defensive walls, the inhabitants freely leave their cities to survey the battlefield that the Lord has already won (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-24.htm">2 Chronicles 20:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>).

God&#8217;s faithfulness, provision, and sovereignty shine through every phrase, assuring believers that His Word is both accurate and literally dependable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Shall burn them with fire seven years.--</span>The representation of this and the following verse, that the weapons of the army of Gog shall furnish the whole nation of Israel with fuel for seven years, cannot, of course, be understood literally, and seems to have been inserted by the prophet to show that we are to look for the meaning of his prophecy beyond any literal event of earthly warfare.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/39-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.">Ezekiel 39:11-16</a> again present the magnitude of the attack upon the Church by describing the burial of the host after it is slain. The language, if it could be supposed it was meant to be literally understood, would be even more extravagant than that of <a href="/context/ezekiel/39-9.htm" title="And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:">Ezekiel 39:9-10</a>.

So huge should be the quantity of weapons left behind by the slain, that the Israelites should <span class="cmt_word">burn them with fire seven years</span>. This burning of the weapons has been explained by Havernick, on the ground that weapons of war, as incompatible with Messianic times, should be no more required (cf. <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>); by Ewald, as in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews (<a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>) and other ancient peoples (Livy, 38:23; Virgil, 'AEneid,' 8:562); by Hitzig and Smend, as prompted by the consideration that Israel, for whom Jehovah had fought, should have no further need of weapons; by Schroder, as indicating that for Israel these warlike instruments should then so completely lose their power to terrify that they might be looked upon simply as so much firewood; and by Keil, as designed to annihilate the enemy and remove every trace of him. Kliefoth appears nearest the mark, in suggesting that the emphasis lies upon the length of time the burning should continue; and that this was intended, by conveying an idea of the vastness of the spoil, to represent the thoroughness of Gog's destruction and of Israel's deliverance. That the whole delineation is symbolical appears from the number of years the weapons are said to serve for fuel, viz. seven, and from the character of the weapons themselves, which, if not entirely wooden, were at least all combustible. Of the "armor" generally (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, "something joined," from a root signifying "to join") the pieces mentioned - <span class="cmt_word">the shields and the bucklers</span> (see <a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">the bows and arrows</span> (see ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">the hand-staves</span>, or, <span class="accented">javelins</span> (margin), perhaps, as Hitzig and Smend suggest, the staff with which a horseman strikes his beast (see <a href="/numbers/22-27.htm">Numbers 22:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the spears</span> - were mostly composed of timber. When all should have been given to the flames, it would then appear that on their late owners the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span> had worked out its literal avengement, that they who had intended to despoil Israel were themselves spoiled; and they who hoped to plunder Israel were themselves plundered (comp. <a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then those who dwell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;
