In biblical genealogies, Gomer is a son of Japheth, one of Noah's sons (<a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-3</a>). The mention of "all its troops" suggests a significant military force, indicating a coalition of nations. This aligns with the broader context of <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, which describes a future invasion led by Gog. The inclusion of Gomer highlights the widespread nature of this alliance against Israel.<p><b>and Beth-togarmah from the far north with all its troops</b><br>Beth-togarmah is traditionally associated with the region of Armenia or eastern Turkey. Togarmah is also a descendant of Japheth (<a href="/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>), and its mention here suggests a connection to the peoples of the Caucasus region. The phrase "from the far north" emphasizes the geographical direction from which these forces will come, often interpreted as a reference to regions beyond Israel's immediate neighbors. The repeated mention of "all its troops" underscores the formidable nature of this coalition.<p><b>the many nations with you</b><br>This phrase indicates that the invasion led by Gog will involve a vast alliance of nations. The term "many nations" suggests a diverse and extensive coalition, possibly symbolizing a global opposition to God's people. This aligns with other prophetic scriptures that describe end-times scenarios involving multiple nations (e.g., <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>).

Ezekiel underscores that no participating nation is half-hearted; every contingent is all-in (compare <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The repetition heightens dramatic tension: the more formidable the enemy, the more spectacular God&#8217;s victory (<a href="/ezekiel/38-21.htm">Ezekiel 38:21&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the many nations with you</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8212;the many nations with you.&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The dash breaks the sentence to stress inclusivity: beyond the named groups, countless others join Gog. <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a> echoes this image, describing nations &#8220;in the four corners of the earth&#8212;Gog and Magog.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God sovereignly draws them together (<a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>) to display His holiness before the world (38:16, 23).<p>&#8226; For Israel, this coalition fulfills prophetic warnings of a final, overwhelming threat (<a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>), yet it also ushers in deliverance and restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/39-25.htm">Ezekiel 39:25&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a> adds Gomer and Beth-togarmah to Gog&#8217;s roster, emphasizing their total commitment and northern origin. By highlighting &#8220;all its troops&#8221; and &#8220;many nations,&#8221; the verse builds a picture of a vast, end-time coalition poised against Israel. Scripture elsewhere confirms these peoples&#8217; historical roots, northern location, and martial reputation. The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s decisive intervention, turning the coalition&#8217;s might into a backdrop for His glory and Israel&#8217;s ultimate vindication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Gomer . . .
