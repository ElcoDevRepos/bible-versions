In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>, this is often interpreted as referring to the King of Tyre, but many conservative scholars also see a dual reference to the fall of Satan. The idea of being created points to a beginning that is not self-originated, underscoring the dependency on God as Creator. This aligns with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the initiator of all creation. Theologically, it suggests that all beings, including angels, are created by God and are accountable to Him.<p><b>you were blameless in your ways</b><br>The term "blameless" indicates a state of moral and ethical purity. In the context of the King of Tyre, it suggests a time when his reign was just and righteous. If applied to Satan, it reflects his original state before his rebellion. This mirrors the description of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>, who were created good and without sin. Theologically, it underscores the concept of original righteousness, a state of being that is in perfect harmony with God's will.<p><b>until wickedness was found in you</b><br>This phrase marks a turning point, indicating a fall from grace. For the King of Tyre, it suggests a shift from righteous rule to corruption and pride, as detailed earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>. If referring to Satan, it aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>, which describe the fall of Lucifer due to pride and rebellion. Theologically, it highlights the introduction of sin and the consequences of turning away from God's ways. This serves as a warning of the dangers of pride and the potential for corruption in any created being, emphasizing the need for humility and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

That truth alone keeps every creature accountable to the Creator (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>).<p>- Creation implies purpose. Just as &#8220;God saw all that He had made, and it was very good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), so this being started out reflecting God&#8217;s good design.<p>- The phrase also fixes a clear starting point: there was a moment when this magnificent creature came into existence&#8212;reminding us that only the Lord is eternal (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>).<p>- For us, remembering we are created guards us from the same pride that toppled this figure (<a href="/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You were blameless in your ways</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;you were blameless in your ways&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a>b)<p>- &#8220;Blameless&#8221; describes moral integrity. Like Job, who was called &#8220;blameless and upright&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>), this being once walked in perfect alignment with God&#8217;s will.<p>- His &#8220;ways&#8221; include motives, decisions, and outward actions. Every path he took originally honored the Lord (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p>- This underscores that evil is not inherent in creation; sin is a tragic intrusion. God&#8217;s handiwork begins wholesome, then is marred by rebellion (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>- The king of Tyre enjoyed unrivaled beauty and wisdom (<a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>), gifts intended to display God&#8217;s glory, not self-glorification.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until wickedness was found in you</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;until wickedness was found in you.&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a>c)<p>- A dreadful turning point: &#8220;until.&#8221; The fall was not forced upon him; wickedness &#8220;was found&#8221; within&#8212;originating in pride (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>).<p>- Sin begins internally, then spills outward (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>). No external flaw existed; the corruption started in the heart.<p>- Ezekiel immediately explains how merchandise and pride corrupted him (v. 16-17), echoing how Satan was cast down and how humanity fell in <a href="/bsb/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p>- The moment sin entered, blamelessness ended. One act of rebellion shatters perfection (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s response is decisive: He judges sin wherever it appears, whether in a celestial being, an earthly king, or us (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a> traces a clear arc: created by God, originally flawless, yet fatally corrupted from within. The verse warns every reader that being wonderfully made and richly gifted is no safeguard without ongoing humility before the Creator. Pride opened the door to wickedness for the king of Tyre&#8212;and for the one pictured behind him&#8212;reminding us to stay rooted in our creature-status, cherish God-given integrity, and guard our hearts so that no &#8220;wickedness is found&#8221; in us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Till iniquity was found in thee.--</span>This and the following verse renew still more clearly the comparison with Adam.

The glory of the King of Tyre was, the prophet goes on to say, conditional. He began his reign in righteousness, but afterwards <span class="cmt_word">iniquity was found</span> in him. And the root of that iniquity was the pride of wealth engendered by the greatness of his commerce (Ver. 16). He was no longer like the cherub who guarded the Paradise of God, but like Adam when he was east out from it. Wealth and pride had tempted him to violence and to wrong, and he was no longer an "anointed" or consecrated, but a profaned and desecrated, king. The, "stones of fire," the thunders and lightnings of the Divine Majesty, should no longer protect him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you were created</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(hib&#183;b&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Infinitive construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1254.htm">Strong's 1254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To create, to cut down, select, feed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were blameless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8549.htm">Strong's 8549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Entire, integrity, truth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in your ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7695;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wickedness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;aw&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5766.htm">Strong's 5766: </a> </span><span class="str2">Injustice, unrighteousness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was found in you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(nim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/28-15.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 28:15 You were perfect in your ways (Ezek.
