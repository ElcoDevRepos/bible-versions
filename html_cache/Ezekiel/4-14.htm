The use of "Lord GOD" emphasizes the sovereignty and authority of God, a common theme in prophetic literature. This expression of reverence and submission is seen throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the prophetic books where prophets often address God with deep respect and awe.<p><b>&#8220;I have never defiled myself.&#8221;</b><br>Ezekiel asserts his adherence to the purity laws outlined in the Torah, specifically those concerning dietary restrictions. This claim of personal purity is significant in the context of a prophet, as it underscores his commitment to living a life set apart for God. The concept of defilement is central to the Levitical laws, where physical purity often symbolizes spiritual purity. Ezekiel's statement reflects his dedication to maintaining holiness in accordance with God's commandments.<p><b>From my youth until now I have not eaten anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts.</b><br>This part of the verse refers to specific dietary laws found in <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, which prohibit the consumption of animals that have died naturally or been killed by other animals. Such meat was considered unclean because it had not been properly slaughtered according to ritual standards. Ezekiel's lifelong observance of these laws highlights his faithfulness and the importance of ritual purity in maintaining a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.&#8221;</b><br>Ezekiel's declaration aligns with the dietary laws in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which outline clean and unclean animals. The distinction between clean and unclean was a critical aspect of Israelite identity, setting them apart from surrounding nations. This commitment to dietary laws is echoed in the lives of other biblical figures, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), who also refused to defile himself with unclean food. This adherence to dietary restrictions can be seen as a type of Christ, who lived a sinless life, fulfilling the law perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic acts.

Similar appeals appear in <a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a> and <a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>, where servants of God recognize His authority yet struggle with the command. Here the prophet is not resisting obedience; he is voicing a conscience shaped by God&#8217;s own laws (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>). His first instinct is to honor the Lord even while he trembles at the assignment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I said,</b><p>By recording his response, Ezekiel models transparent dialogue with God. Like David who &#8220;poured out his complaint&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>) and Habakkuk who respectfully questioned the Lord (<a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2&#8211;3</a>), Ezekiel shows that honest speech within covenant loyalty is welcomed. His words flow from a heart already surrendered, not from rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have never defiled myself,</b><p>Defilement in the Law referred to ritual impurity that alienated a person from worship (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s claim echoes <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>, where Daniel resolved not to &#8220;defile himself with the king&#8217;s food.&#8221; Such statements underline that personal holiness matters; obedience is not occasional but habitual. The prophet&#8217;s life has been a living sermon long before his symbolic acts begin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From my youth until now,</b><p>Lifelong faithfulness is on display. Samuel could testify, &#8220;I have walked before you from my youth to this day&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-2.htm">1 Samuel 12:2</a>), and Timothy was taught the Scriptures &#8220;from childhood&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s history reinforces that his objection is not convenience-driven but principle-driven&#8212;formed over decades of covenant living.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have not eaten anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts,</b><p><a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> commands, &#8220;You must not eat the flesh of an animal torn by beasts in the field.&#8221; <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a> repeat the prohibition. Such carcasses symbolized death&#8217;s corruption; touching them rendered a person unclean. Ezekiel has meticulously guarded himself against that contamination, so the Lord&#8217;s directive to cook bread over human dung (<a href="/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>) strikes him as dangerously close to violating the same purity standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth,</b><p>The prophet echoes Peter&#8217;s later declaration, &#8220;I have never eaten anything impure or unclean&#8221; (<a href="/acts/11-8.htm">Acts 11:8</a>, recalling <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a>). This lifelong discipline highlights that obedience is possible even in exile. It also underscores the shock value of God&#8217;s sign-act: Israel&#8217;s upcoming siege will force them into conditions they once deemed unthinkable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a> records a faithful servant&#8217;s heartfelt concern that a prophetic sign might break God&#8217;s dietary laws. By appealing to his lifelong purity, Ezekiel clarifies he is not resisting God&#8217;s will but seeking to remain consistent with it. The verse therefore teaches:<p>&#8226; Reverent honesty with the Lord is legitimate.<p>&#8226; Long-term obedience gives weight to our convictions.<p>&#8226; God sometimes orders dramatic symbols to portray judgment, yet He remains attentive to the integrity of His messenger (<a href="/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>).<p>Ultimately, the exchange magnifies both God&#8217;s holiness in judgment and His willingness to accommodate a faithful conscience, affirming that Scripture&#8217;s standards of purity remain trustworthy and true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I, Ah, Lord God!</span> etc. The formula is, curiously enough, equally characteristic of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/9-8.htm">Ezekiel 9:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>) and of his teacher and contemporary (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>). The Vulgate represents it by <span class="accented">A, a, a</span>. His plea, which reminds us at once of <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a> and <a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>, is that he has kept himself free from all ceremonial pollution connected with food. And is he, a priest too, to do this? That be far from him! Anything but that! The kinds of defilement of which he speaks are noted in <a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-24.htm">Leviticus 7:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39, 40</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>.
