The direction "northward" is significant in biblical symbolism, often associated with judgment or divine presence. The "outer court" is part of the temple complex, accessible to the general public, including Gentiles, and represents a place of preparation and purification before entering the more sacred inner areas. This movement northward may symbolize a transition from common to holy, reflecting the journey of spiritual growth and sanctification.<p><b>and he brought me to the group of chambers</b><br>These chambers are likely storage rooms or living quarters for priests, indicating the practical needs of temple service. They may also symbolize the provision and preparation necessary for those who serve God. In a broader sense, these chambers can be seen as a type of the church, where believers are prepared and equipped for service. The presence of these chambers highlights the organized and purposeful nature of worship and service in God's plan.<p><b>opposite the temple courtyard</b><br>The location "opposite the temple courtyard" suggests a direct relationship and proximity to the temple itself, emphasizing the importance of these chambers in relation to worship. The courtyard is a place of gathering and sacrifice, central to the worship practices of Israel. This positioning underscores the idea that service and preparation (represented by the chambers) are directly connected to worship and sacrifice (represented by the courtyard).<p><b>and the outer wall on the north side</b><br>The "outer wall" serves as a boundary, marking the separation between the sacred space of the temple and the outside world. This wall signifies protection and sanctity, ensuring that what is holy remains undefiled. The mention of the "north side" again highlights the direction associated with divine activity and judgment. In a prophetic sense, this could point to the ultimate protection and sanctification provided by Christ, who is the true temple and the one who separates His people from the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of divine visions, including the detailed vision of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Likely an angelic figure or a divine guide, this man leads Ezekiel through the vision of the temple, providing measurements and descriptions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/outer_court.htm">Outer Court</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex, the outer court is a significant area for worship and gathering, symbolizing access to God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/north_gate.htm">North Gate</a></b><br>One of the gates of the temple, the north gate is a point of entry and exit, symbolizing direction and movement in the vision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chambers.htm">Chambers</a></b><br>These are rooms or spaces within the temple complex, possibly used for priestly activities or storage, indicating the functional aspects of temple worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_order_and_design.htm">God's Order and Design</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple reflects God's order and intentionality.

This building Kiel, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre hold to have been the erection on the gizrah; Ewald, Kliefoth, Smend, and Currey believe it to have meant the temple. The question as to which view is correct is immaterial, since the row of chambers extended in front of parts of both buildings. Ewald, as usual, follows the LXX., and translates, "brought me to the fifteen (another Greek text has five) cells;" but of this the Hebrew contains nothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the man led me out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;i&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
