These include Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles. These times were not only for celebration but also for remembrance of God's deliverance and provision. They are deeply rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, serving as reminders of His faithfulness and the people's need for repentance and renewal.<p><b>the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute to God, symbolizing the dedication of the fruits of labor to Him. An ephah is a unit of dry measure, approximately equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. The offering of an ephah with a bull signifies a substantial offering, reflecting the importance of the occasion and the wealth or status of the offerer. Bulls were often used in significant sacrifices, symbolizing strength and service.<p><b>an ephah with a ram</b><br>The ram, like the bull, was a valuable animal used in sacrifices, often associated with atonement and consecration. The offering of an ephah with a ram indicates a similar level of dedication and worship. Rams were used in various offerings, including the burnt offering and the peace offering, which were expressions of devotion and thanksgiving to God.<p><b>and as much as one is able to give with the lambs</b><br>This phrase introduces a principle of proportional giving, allowing for flexibility based on the individual's capacity. Lambs were common sacrificial animals, accessible to more people than bulls or rams. This provision ensures that everyone, regardless of economic status, could participate in the worship and offerings, emphasizing the inclusivity of God's covenant community.<p><b>along with a hin of oil per ephah</b><br>A hin is a liquid measure, approximately 3.7 liters or about 1 gallon. Oil was a significant part of offerings, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration. The inclusion of oil with the grain offering enhances its value and significance, representing the richness of God's provision and the anointing of His Spirit. This combination of grain and oil in offerings is seen throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the holistic nature of worship that involves both physical and spiritual elements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
