The "net" signifies God's sovereign control and the certainty of His plans. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages where God uses similar language to describe His judgment (e.g., <a href="/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a>). It emphasizes the futility of resisting God's will.<p><b>and he will be caught in My snare.</b><br>The "snare" further illustrates the inevitability of the judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to King Zedekiah of Judah, who attempted to escape the Babylonian siege but was captured. The snare represents the consequences of disobedience and rebellion against God, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans;</b><br>This phrase indicates the destination of the exile, Babylon, which was the center of the Chaldean Empire. Historically, Babylon was a powerful city known for its grandeur and idolatry. The exile to Babylon fulfilled earlier prophecies (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>) and served as a punishment for Judah's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>yet he will not see it,</b><br>This enigmatic statement was fulfilled when Zedekiah was captured, blinded, and taken to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). It highlights the precision of biblical prophecy and the severe consequences of defying God's commands. The phrase underscores the tragic irony of Zedekiah's fate&#8212;being in Babylon but unable to see it.<p><b>and there he will die.</b><br>Zedekiah's death in Babylon marks the end of his reign and serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of disobedience. It reflects the broader theme of divine justice throughout Scripture. The death in exile symbolizes the ultimate separation from the land God promised to His people, a consequence of their persistent rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel was called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon, leading to the siege of Jerusalem and his eventual capture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The land of the Chaldeans, Babylon was the empire that conquered Judah and took its people into exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_net_and_snare.htm">The Net and Snare</a></b><br>Symbolic imagery used by God to describe the inescapable judgment and capture of Zedekiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans</a></b><br>The ruling people of Babylon, known for their military prowess and influence during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God's use of the imagery of a net and snare emphasizes His control over the events of history and His ability to execute judgment according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Zedekiah's fate serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of rebelling against God's commands and the importance of obedience to His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_prophecy.htm">The Certainty of Prophecy</a></b><br>Ezekiel's prophecy and its fulfillment demonstrate the reliability of God's word and the certainty of His promises, both of judgment and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Ezekiel's role as a prophet highlights the importance of listening to God's messengers and heeding their warnings to avoid spiritual and physical ruin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_beyond_judgment.htm">Hope Beyond Judgment</a></b><br>While this passage focuses on judgment, it is part of a larger account that includes eventual restoration and hope for God's people, encouraging believers to trust in God's ultimate plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_12_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 12:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_13_God_s_control_over_plans.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:13 illustrate God's sovereignty over human plans and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_net_in_Ezekiel_12_13.htm">What does the "net" symbolize in Ezekiel 12:13, and why is it significant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_13_God_s_judgment_links.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:13 connect with God's judgment in other prophetic books?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Ezekiel_12_13_daily.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Ezekiel 12:13 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_13_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">What does Ezekiel 12:13 teach about the consequences of disobedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_13_and_Jerusalem_s_fall.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:13 relate to the historical fall of Jerusalem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_meaning_of_the_net_in_Ezekiel_12_13.htm">What is the significance of the "net" in Ezekiel 12:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_13_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:13 demonstrate God's sovereignty over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_ezekiel_12_13_with_history.htm">Ezekiel 12:13 foretells a ruler&#8217;s capture, yet some historical accounts appear to conflict with the exact manner of King Zedekiah&#8217;s downfall; how can these differences be reconciled?

Josephus has a curious story (<span class= "ital">Antiq. </span>x. 7, ? 2), that Zedekiah was inclined to believe the warnings of Jeremiah that he should be carried captive to Babylon; but when Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, saying that he should not see the land, he conceived the two prophecies to be contradictory, and so disbelieved them both. Zedekiah's death in Babylon is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My net also will I spread,</span> etc. Compare the same image in <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. The prediction of ver. 12 is reiterated with emphasis. Zedekiah shall be in Babylon, yet shall not see. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10. 7:2; 8:2) relates that Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah, finding an apparent discrepancy in the words that he should not see Babylon, and those of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), hardened himself in his unbelief. There is no reason, however, for supposing that Josephus had access to any other records than the books of the two prophets, and his narrative looks rather like an imagined history of what might have been. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I will spread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;ra&#347;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
