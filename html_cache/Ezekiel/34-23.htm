The concept of a "shepherd" is deeply rooted in the biblical tradition, symbolizing guidance, care, and protection. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings and leaders were often referred to as shepherds of their people, emphasizing their role in ensuring the well-being and safety of their subjects. This promise of one shepherd points to a future time of restoration and unity under a divinely appointed leader.<p><b>My servant David</b><br>The reference to "David" is not to King David himself, who had long since passed, but to a future leader from David's lineage. This is a messianic prophecy, indicating that the coming shepherd will embody the qualities of David, who was a man after God's own heart. The Davidic Covenant, found in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promises that David's throne will be established forever, pointing to the Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. This connection underscores the expectation of a righteous and eternal ruler.<p><b>and he will feed them</b><br>Feeding here is metaphorical, representing the provision of spiritual nourishment, guidance, and care. This imagery is consistent with the role of a shepherd who ensures that the flock has access to green pastures and still waters, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. The shepherd's role is to lead the sheep to sustenance, ensuring their growth and health. This phrase emphasizes the nurturing aspect of the promised leader's reign, providing for the needs of the people.<p><b>He will feed them and be their shepherd</b><br>Reiterating the role of the shepherd, this phrase emphasizes the ongoing and active care that the leader will provide. The repetition underscores the certainty and importance of this promise. In the New Testament, Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), fulfilling this prophecy by offering His life for the sheep and providing eternal life. This connection highlights the continuity of God's plan for His people, ensuring they are led and cared for by a faithful shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and symbolic actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>Symbolically represents leadership and guidance.

Yet it should be remembered, if any one should incline to understand this whole prophecy literally, that if one part is to be so understood the rest must be taken in the same way; if we are to think that the prophet here foretells the literal restoration of the two kingdoms of Israel to their own land, and their union under one governor, then that governor must be David himself. The absurdity of such a supposition is one important element in showing that the whole is to be understood of a promise of spiritual blessings, and of the gathering of God's people into His Church as one flock under their Almighty Shepherd. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14-18</a>.)
