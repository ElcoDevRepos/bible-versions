It served as a fortress and a place of refuge for many, including the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7-9</a>). The darkening of the day symbolizes impending judgment and calamity, often associated with divine intervention (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>). This imagery of darkness is used throughout the Bible to signify God's judgment (<a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>).<p><b>when I break the yoke of Egypt</b><br>The "yoke" represents oppression and bondage, often used to describe the subjugation of one nation by another (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2</a>). Egypt's yoke refers to its dominance and influence over other nations, which God promises to break. This breaking of the yoke signifies liberation and the end of Egypt's power, aligning with God's historical pattern of delivering His people from oppression (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p><b>and her proud strength comes to an end</b><br>Egypt was renowned for its military might and cultural achievements, often characterized by pride and self-reliance (<a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>). The end of Egypt's proud strength indicates a humbling by God, a common theme where God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). This serves as a reminder of the futility of human pride against divine sovereignty.<p><b>A cloud will cover her</b><br>The cloud is a metaphor for impending doom and divine judgment. In biblical literature, clouds often accompany God's presence and judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>). This imagery suggests an overwhelming and inescapable judgment that envelops Egypt, indicating God's active role in the unfolding events.<p><b>and her daughters will go into captivity</b><br>"Daughters" here likely refers to the smaller towns and settlements under Egypt's control, personified as female dependents. Captivity is a common consequence of divine judgment, as seen in the Babylonian exile of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). This phrase underscores the totality of Egypt's defeat and the dispersion of its people, reflecting the broader biblical theme of exile as a result of sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tehaphnehes.htm">Tehaphnehes</a></b><br>An ancient city in Egypt, known as a significant fortress and royal residence.

When God turns out the lights, no human power can switch them back on.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When I break the yoke of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;I break the yoke of Egypt&#8221; recalls the imagery God used about other oppressors (<a href="/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>). A yoke is what masters place on beasts of burden; Egypt had long been a heavy yoke on surrounding nations&#8212;and on God&#8217;s own people (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord Himself, not a mere human coalition, is the One snapping that yoke. He had earlier promised, &#8220;Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-15.htm">Ezekiel 29:15</a>), and here He declares exactly how that humbling will begin.<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s advance (<a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a>) would physically shatter Egypt&#8217;s military harness, proving that the Most High &#8220;removes kings and sets up kings&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her proud strength comes to an end</b><p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s self-confidence was legendary&#8212;her monuments, armies, and wealth boasted of millennia of power. Yet &#8220;pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The loss of strength is both military and spiritual: &#8220;The arrogance of Egypt will come to an end&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13</a>). No Pharaoh, no priest, no idol can stop the decree of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God had previously broken Judah for pride; now He does the same to Egypt so the nations will know that He alone is God (<a href="/ezekiel/30-19.htm">Ezekiel 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A cloud will cover her</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture, an ominous cloud often signals divine judgment sweeping in (<a href="/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a>; <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>). Picture the dust of invading armies, the smoke of burning cities, and the gloom of despair hovering like a storm cloud.<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at God&#8217;s personal presence in judgment&#8212;the opposite of the protective cloud that led Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). Egypt once watched that cloud guide Israel; now a cloud of wrath envelops her.<p>&#8226; Under that covering, visibility, hope, and escape all disappear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her daughters will go into captivity</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Her daughters&#8221; refers to Egypt&#8217;s secondary cities and settlements&#8212;places like Memphis, Pelusium, and Thebes (<a href="/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13-16</a>). When the capital falls, the provinces suffer too.<p>&#8226; Captivity fulfills God&#8217;s word: &#8220;I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>).

It was another frontier-fortress in the neighborhood of Pelusium, built by Psammetichus.

Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give "the scepters" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by "supports" or "props," the "red" being used as a "staff" rather than as a "scepter" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of her strength</span>. The phrase meets us again in <a href="/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>, and includes what we speak of as the parade of power, here probably with a view to the foreign forces that garrisoned both Daphne and Pelusium. The <span class="cmt_word">daughters</span> may be literally <span class="accented">the women</span> of the city, who were to share the usual fate of their sex on the capture of a city; or as in <a href="/ezekiel/26-6.htm">Ezekiel 26:6, 8</a>; or probably as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53, 55</a>, for the villages and towns dependent on the strong city.
