In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile, and the land was desolate. The promise to fill the land with people and animals signifies a return to normalcy and prosperity. This echoes the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to be fruitful and multiply, filling the earth. The restoration of both people and animals indicates a holistic renewal of the land, reminiscent of the blessings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, where the fruitfulness of the womb and livestock are signs of God's favor.<p><b>and they will multiply and be fruitful</b><br>This promise of multiplication and fruitfulness is a direct reversal of the curses experienced during the exile. It signifies not only physical growth but also spiritual and communal flourishing. The language here is reminiscent of the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>, where God promises to make Abraham exceedingly fruitful. This multiplication is a sign of divine blessing and covenant faithfulness, pointing to a future hope where God's people will thrive under His care.<p><b>I will make you as inhabited as you once were</b><br>This phrase speaks to the restoration of the land to its former glory. Historically, the land of Israel was once a thriving nation under kings like David and Solomon. The promise to make it as inhabited as before suggests a return to those prosperous times. This restoration is not just physical but also spiritual, as the people return to their covenant relationship with God. It reflects the prophetic hope found in <a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>, where the Lord comforts Zion and makes her deserts like Eden.<p><b>and I will make you prosper more than before</b><br>Here, the promise goes beyond mere restoration to an even greater prosperity than previously experienced. This is a theme found throughout the prophetic literature, where the future glory surpasses the former (<a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>). It points to the eschatological hope of a new covenant, where God's people will experience unprecedented blessings. This prosperity is not just material but also spiritual, as it involves a deeper relationship with God and a more profound understanding of His purposes.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This concluding phrase emphasizes the ultimate purpose of God's actions: the recognition of His sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the phrase "you will know that I am the LORD" is a recurring theme, underscoring the importance of acknowledging God's authority and covenant relationship with His people. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, as the people witness God's power and grace in their restoration. It points to the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who makes the Father known (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages of judgment and restoration to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who were in exile during Ezekiel's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_and_ruins.htm">Cities and Ruins</a></b><br>Symbolic of the desolation experienced by Israel due to their disobedience and subsequent exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_of_people_and_animals.htm">Multiplication of People and Animals</a></b><br>Represents God's promise of restoration and blessing, indicating a return to prosperity and abundance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises restoration and renewal to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>Despite Israel's disobedience, God remains faithful to His promises, offering hope and restoration.

By naming both people and livestock, He promises a holistic restoration of community life and economic stability. Similar imagery is used in <a href="/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-13</a>, where &#8220;flocks will again pass under the hands of the One who counts them,&#8221; and in <a href="/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8-10</a>, where the land &#8220;will be tilled and sown.&#8221; The promise is literal: fields once barren will echo with human voices and the sounds of herds, signaling divine reversal of exile&#8217;s emptiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they will multiply and be fruitful</b><p>Multiplication recalls the original blessing of <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> and the post-flood renewal of <a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>. Here, God applies the same life-giving command to a land previously under curse. Fruitfulness encompasses population growth, thriving agriculture, and flourishing herds, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>: &#8220;The LORD your God will make you prosper abundantly in all the work of your hands, in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land.&#8221; The covenant faithfulness of God ensures that what He plants, He causes to increase.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make you as inhabited as you once were</b><p>The Lord sets a clear benchmark: restoration to former population levels. This answers the despair voiced in <a href="/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, where the land sat empty despite Israel&#8217;s claims to it. By explicitly matching the past, God shows He has lost none of His original intent for Israel&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/bsb/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>). The phrase signals continuity with the nation&#8217;s history rather than a mere spiritual metaphor; real cities will teem again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will make you prosper more than before</b><p>Restoration is not just a return to baseline&#8212;it is an escalation. <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25-27</a> likewise promises that the years &#8220;the locust has eaten&#8221; will be recompensed with overflow. <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a> declares, &#8220;The glory of this latter house will be greater than the former.&#8221; God&#8217;s nature is to redeem loss with surplus so that His grace stands out all the more (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>). Economically, socially, and spiritually, Israel&#8217;s future exceeds its storied past under David and Solomon, hinting at the messianic age when Christ reigns in righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><p>The climax of every divine act is relational knowledge. Repeated throughout Ezekiel (e.g., 36:23, 37:14), the phrase links God&#8217;s self-revelation to tangible events in history. The people&#8217;s recognition flows from seeing prophecy fulfilled before their eyes; restoration becomes a living sermon. <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> established the same pattern: deliverance leads to the confession, &#8220;You will know that I am the LORD your God.&#8221; Here, the restored nation embodies a testimony to surrounding peoples (<a href="/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a>), inviting them to acknowledge the covenant-keeping God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a> unveils a comprehensive promise: physical repopulation, explosive growth, renewed habitation, surpassing prosperity, and resulting God-awareness. Each clause builds toward the ultimate goal&#8212;God glorified through a visibly restored Israel. The verse assures readers that divine judgment never has the last word; God&#8217;s pledge to bless His people and their land stands firm, inviting present trust in His unwavering faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Will multiply upon you.--</span>The promises of abundant blessing of this, with the previous and following verses, certainly received a partial fulfilment at the time following the return from the exile, and in the subsequent Maccabean period; yet one cannot but feel that the language of promise, if taken only in a literal sense, goes far beyond the historic fulfilment, and hence that these earthly blessings are the shadow and type by which is set forth the higher spiritual blessing given to the Church without stint.<p><span class= "bld">Settle you after your old estates.--</span>This does not mean that particular families are to have again each their own former inheritance--though, doubtless, this was true, as far as circumstances allowed, of the comparatively small number of families who returned--but that they shall in general be settled and prosperous, as of old. And even this promise is eclipsed by the next clause: "I will do better unto you than at your beginnings," which can only be considered as fulfilled in the spiritual blessings, far higher and better than anything of earth, of the Messianic kingdom.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will fill</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hir&#183;b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
