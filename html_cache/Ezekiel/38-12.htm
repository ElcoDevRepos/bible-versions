The desire for material gain is a common theme in biblical warfare narratives. Historically, nations often engaged in battles to acquire wealth and resources. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human greed and the consequences of coveting what belongs to others, as seen in stories like Achan's sin in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>. The prophetic context suggests a future event where nations are drawn to Israel for its prosperity, echoing the eschatological battles described in <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8-9</a>.<p><b>to turn a hand against the desolate places now inhabited</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformation of the land of Israel from desolation to habitation. Historically, the land of Israel experienced periods of desolation, particularly during the Babylonian exile. The return and rebuilding under leaders like Zerubbabel and Nehemiah marked a significant change. This transformation is also prophetic, pointing to the future restoration of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>, where the desert is said to blossom. It underscores God's faithfulness in restoring His people and land.<p><b>and against a people gathered from the nations</b><br>This phrase refers to the regathering of the Jewish people from the diaspora, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. The return from Babylonian exile is a historical precursor, but the prophecy extends to a future ingathering, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>. This regathering is significant in eschatological contexts, symbolizing God's covenant faithfulness and the fulfillment of promises made to Abraham about his descendants.<p><b>who have acquired livestock and possessions</b><br>This phrase indicates the prosperity of the people in the land. In biblical times, livestock and possessions were primary indicators of wealth and stability. The mention of these suggests a period of peace and blessing, reminiscent of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for obedience. It also contrasts with the desolation previously mentioned, highlighting the dramatic change in Israel's fortunes.<p><b>and who live at the center of the land.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Israel's geographical and theological centrality. Geographically, Israel is situated at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe, making it a strategic location. Theologically, it is central to God's redemptive plan, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8-9</a>, where God apportions the nations with Israel as His inheritance. This centrality is also reflected in the messianic hope, with Jerusalem as the focal point of Christ's future reign, as prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader from the land of Magog, often interpreted as a symbol of future enemies of God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/magog.htm">Magog</a></b><br>A region or people group mentioned in prophecy, often associated with end-times events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation gathered from the nations, living in the land promised to them by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resettled_ruins.htm">The Resettled Ruins</a></b><br>Refers to the restoration of Israel, both physically and spiritually, after periods of desolation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Represents the various peoples from whom the Israelites have been gathered, highlighting the regathering of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_restoration.htm">God's Sovereignty in Restoration</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the restoration of His people.
