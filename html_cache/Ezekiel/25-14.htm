This animosity is documented throughout the Old Testament, including in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>. Edom's hostility towards Israel is further highlighted in Obadiah, where Edom is condemned for its actions during the Babylonian invasion of Jerusalem. God's vengeance on Edom is a fulfillment of His promise to judge nations that oppose His people.<p><b>by the hand of My people Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates that God will use Israel as His instrument of judgment against Edom. Historically, this reflects the times when Israel, under divine guidance, acted as an agent of God's justice, as seen in the conquests during the time of Joshua. It underscores the theme of God empowering His people to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used other nations to discipline Israel when they strayed from His commandments.<p><b>and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath</b><br>God's anger and wrath are expressions of His righteous judgment against sin and rebellion. The severity of the punishment reflects the seriousness of Edom's offenses against Israel. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where God's wrath is poured out on nations, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-13</a> against Babylon. It serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the consequences of opposing His will.<p><b>Then they will know My vengeance</b><br>The purpose of God's vengeance is not only punitive but also revelatory. It is meant to demonstrate His sovereignty and justice, leading to the acknowledgment of His power. This echoes the broader biblical theme where God's actions lead to the recognition of His authority, as seen in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where the Egyptians come to know the Lord through the plagues.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the certainty and authority of the prophecy. The use of "Lord GOD" (Yahweh Elohim) underscores the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, highlighting His faithfulness to His promises. It assures the fulfillment of His word, as seen in other prophetic declarations throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-11</a>, where God asserts His ability to bring His plans to fruition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

For Israel and the nations, it reinforces the truth that the Lord defends His covenant and keeps His word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This culmination looks ahead to the day when every tongue will acknowledge God&#8217;s righteous reign (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10&#8211;11</a>), some in worship, others in regret.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a> promises Edom a decisive, God-initiated reckoning carried out through Israel.

It reminds us that the Lord faithfully defends His people, judges persistent evil, and orchestrates events so all will eventually acknowledge His righteous sovereignty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">By the hand of my people Israel.</span>--This points distinctly to the fact that the Divine vengeance on Edom should be accomplished by the hand of the Israelites, a prophecy which was fulfilled when they were conquered by John Hyrcanus, and compelled to submit to circumcision as a mark of absorption into the Jewish people. Subsequently Herod (who was himself of Idumean origin), as king of the Jews, reigned over them, and their name disappeared from history.<p>Many commentators would see in this prophecy a further intimation of their ultimate conversion and incorporation into the Church; but this seems quite foreign, not only to the scope of this series of prophecies, but especially to the connection, "I will lay my vengeance upon Edom," and "they shall know my vengeance."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the hand of my people Israel</span>: The words received a fulfillment in the conquest of Edom by John Hyrcanus, who compelled its people to receive circumcision (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:09. 1).
