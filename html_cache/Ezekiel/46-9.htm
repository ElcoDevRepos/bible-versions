These feasts were central to Jewish worship and community life, serving as times of remembrance, thanksgiving, and renewal of the covenant with God. The phrase "come before the LORD" emphasizes the act of worship and the presence of God in the temple, which was the focal point of Jewish religious life. The appointed feasts were not only times of celebration but also of spiritual reflection and commitment to God's laws.<p><b>whoever enters by the north gate to worship must go out by the south gate</b><br>This instruction highlights the orderly and reverent manner in which worshipers were to conduct themselves in the temple. The requirement to exit through a different gate than the one entered symbolizes a transformation or change that should occur when one encounters God. It also reflects the practical need for managing the flow of large crowds during the feasts. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for the change that should occur in a believer's life after experiencing God's presence.<p><b>and whoever enters by the south gate must go out by the north gate</b><br>This mirrors the previous instruction, reinforcing the idea of transformation and orderliness in worship. It ensures that worshipers do not simply return to their previous state or routine after encountering God. The temple's design and the prescribed movement within it can be seen as a reflection of God's order and holiness, reminding worshipers of the need for reverence and obedience.<p><b>No one is to return through the gate by which he entered</b><br>This command underscores the importance of change and renewal in the worship experience. It suggests that an encounter with God should leave a lasting impact, prompting believers to leave behind their old ways. Theologically, it can be seen as a call to repentance and a new direction in life, aligning with the broader biblical theme of transformation through faith.<p><b>but each must go out by the opposite gate</b><br>This final instruction completes the picture of a worship experience that leads to change. It emphasizes the idea of moving forward and not returning to one's previous state. In a broader biblical context, this can be connected to the concept of new life in Christ, where believers are called to leave behind their old selves and walk in newness of life. The physical act of exiting through a different gate serves as a tangible reminder of the spiritual journey and transformation that worship should inspire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who are coming to worship the LORD during the appointed feasts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is the focus of worship and the one who establishes these commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_appointed_feasts.htm">The Appointed Feasts</a></b><br>Specific times set by God for the Israelites to gather and worship, such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_north_gate_and_south_gate.htm">The North Gate and South Gate</a></b><br>Entrances to the temple area, symbolizing the orderly and reverent approach to worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/orderly_worship.htm">Orderly Worship</a></b><br>The instruction to enter and exit through different gates emphasizes the importance of order and reverence in worship.
