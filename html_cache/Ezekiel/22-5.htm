The "near" refers to neighboring nations such as Ammon, Moab, and Edom, who were often in conflict with Israel. The "far" could include more distant nations like Babylon and Assyria, who had significant interactions with Israel. This mocking fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where God warns Israel that if they disobey, they will become "an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations." The mockery from both near and far highlights the complete disgrace and the loss of respect that Jerusalem will suffer due to its sins.<p><b>O infamous city</b><br>Jerusalem, the city in question, was meant to be a beacon of God's presence and holiness, as seen in its selection as the site of the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). However, it became infamous due to its idolatry, injustice, and bloodshed, as detailed earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/22.htm">Ezekiel 22</a>. The term "infamous" suggests a reputation that has been tarnished by repeated transgressions. This infamy is a direct result of the city's failure to uphold the covenant with God, leading to its downfall and the subsequent exile of its people.<p><b>full of turmoil</b><br>The turmoil in Jerusalem is both internal and external. Internally, the city was rife with corruption, violence, and moral decay, as described in <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-12</a>. Leaders and priests were failing in their duties, leading to societal chaos. Externally, the city faced threats from powerful empires like Babylon, which would eventually lead to its destruction in 586 BC. This turmoil is a consequence of the people's rebellion against God, fulfilling the prophetic warnings of unrest and destruction found in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>.
