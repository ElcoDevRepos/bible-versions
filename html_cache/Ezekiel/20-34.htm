In biblical context, a "strong hand" often refers to God's deliverance and intervention, as seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/6.htm">Exodus 6:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>). It emphasizes God's ability to act decisively and powerfully on behalf of His people. The imagery of strength is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His capability to fulfill His promises.<p><b>An outstretched arm</b><br>The "outstretched arm" is a metaphor for God's active involvement in the affairs of His people. It suggests readiness and willingness to save and protect. This imagery is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe God's deliverance, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> and <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>. It conveys the idea of God reaching out to rescue His people from their plight, highlighting His compassion and commitment.<p><b>And outpoured wrath</b><br>This phrase indicates God's judgment and righteous anger against sin and disobedience. The concept of divine wrath is consistent throughout the Bible, where God's holiness demands justice (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). In Ezekiel's context, it reflects the consequences of Israel's idolatry and rebellion. However, it also serves as a purifying force, intended to bring about repentance and restoration.<p><b>I will bring you out from the peoples</b><br>This promise of deliverance echoes the Exodus, where God brought the Israelites out of Egypt. It signifies a future regathering of the Jewish people from among the nations where they have been dispersed. This theme of restoration is prevalent in prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>, pointing to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises.<p><b>And gather you from the lands</b><br>The gathering from the lands underscores the widespread dispersion of the Israelites due to exile and disobedience. It reflects the historical context of the Babylonian exile and anticipates a future regathering. This gathering is not only physical but also spiritual, as God restores His people to Himself. It aligns with prophecies of restoration found in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>.<p><b>To which you have been scattered</b><br>The scattering of Israel is a consequence of their covenant unfaithfulness, as warned in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. This dispersion serves as both punishment and a means of preserving a remnant. The promise of regathering highlights God's mercy and the hope of redemption. It foreshadows the ultimate gathering of God's people in the eschatological future, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

hand&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-34.htm">Ezekiel 20:34</a>) points to God&#8217;s unmatched power. He is not negotiating Israel&#8217;s release; He is enforcing it. Think of earlier deliverances:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>&#8212;God took Israel &#8220;by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Nothing is too difficult for You!&#8221;.<p>These verses affirm that the same omnipotent God who pried Israel from Pharaoh&#8217;s grip will again act decisively. His hand is strong enough to break every chain that holds His people&#8212;whether external oppression or internal unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>an outstretched arm</b><p>An outstretched arm is an image of personal involvement. The Lord does not rescue from a distance; He reaches into the mess:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a> declares that He brought Israel out &#8220;with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; His loving devotion endures forever&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a> shows His arm ruling in strength while also tenderly shepherding (v. 11).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> speaks of the nations trembling &#8220;because of the greatness of Your arm&#8221;.<p>God&#8217;s arm reassures the faithful and unnerves the resistant. It signals both intimacy and authority, reminding us that redemption is relational: the Creator leans in to lift His children.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and outpoured wrath</b><p>Deliverance comes with judgment. The same power that saves the repentant overturns the rebellious:<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/20-33.htm">Ezekiel 20:33</a>&#8212;God swears to reign over Israel &#8220;with fury poured out&#8221;, emphasizing holy jealousy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD is a jealous and avenging God&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>&#8212;His wrath is revealed against ungodliness.<p>Israel&#8217;s dispersion was a result of covenant breach; their regathering includes righteous discipline. God&#8217;s wrath is not capricious but covenantal&#8212;expressed so that sin is exposed, idols are shattered, and His holiness vindicated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will bring you out from the peoples</b><p>Here the focus shifts to location and identity. Scattered among foreign nations, Israel looked indistinguishable, yet God promises:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>&#8212;He &#8220;will gather you again from all the peoples&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>&#8212;He will &#8220;gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13</a>&#8212;He will &#8220;bring them into their own land&#8221;.<p>The phrase underscores separation. God&#8217;s people cannot remain forever absorbed in the world&#8217;s systems. He acts to bring them out&#8212;physically, spiritually, and culturally&#8212;restoring distinctiveness and covenant purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered</b><p>The promise culminates in restoration:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>&#8212;He &#8220;will assemble the banished of Israel and gather the dispersed of Judah&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all countries&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>&#8212;The Son of Man &#8220;will send out His angels&#8230; and they will gather His elect&#8221;.<p>God&#8217;s gathering is comprehensive&#8212;no exile too distant, no remnant too small.

The strong hand guarantees the outcome, the outstretched arm communicates personal involvement, and the outpoured wrath assures justice. God&#8217;s purpose is clear: extract His covenant people from worldly entanglement and restore them to their promised inheritance. The verse invites confidence that every scattered believer and every displaced promise will be gathered by the same faithful, powerful, and holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Bring you out from the people.--</span>This and the parallel clause, "gather you out of the countries," cannot refer to the restoration of the people to their land, both because it is an avenging act, "with fury poured out"; and also because its object is said in the next verse to be to bring them into the wilderness. It must therefore refer to the Divine dealings with the people in their dispersion. He will separate them from other people; He will not allow them, as they proposed (<a href="/ezekiel/20-32.htm" title="And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.">Ezekiel 20:32</a>), to "be as the heathen;" but will bring them out and gather them as a distinct race and spiritually separated from them all, to be dealt with as His own peculiar people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - The prophet's words seem to look beyond the horizon of any fulfilment as yet seen in history, of which the return of the exiles under Zerubbabel was but the pledge and earnest.
