In biblical context, cherubim are often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, such as the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). The anointing signifies a divine appointment, indicating a position of honor and responsibility. This passage is often interpreted as a reference to the King of Tyre, but also seen as a symbolic representation of Satan before his fall, highlighting his original exalted status.<p><b>for I had ordained you</b><br>The ordination implies a deliberate and purposeful act by God, establishing the cherub's role and authority. This reflects the biblical theme of divine sovereignty and the intentional design of God's creation. The ordination underscores the idea that the cherub's position was not self-appointed but granted by God, emphasizing accountability to the Creator.<p><b>You were on the holy mountain of God</b><br>The "holy mountain of God" is a symbolic representation of God's presence and authority. In biblical literature, mountains often signify places of divine revelation and encounter, such as Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and Mount Zion (<a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>). This imagery suggests a place of closeness to God, where the cherub had access to divine wisdom and glory. It also connects to the idea of Eden as a mountain sanctuary, a place of initial perfection and communion with God.<p><b>you walked among the fiery stones</b><br>The "fiery stones" are often interpreted as a metaphor for the divine presence and the purity and holiness associated with it. Walking among them suggests an intimate relationship with God and access to His glory. This imagery may also evoke the vision of God's throne room, as described in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>, where fire and brilliance are prominent.

"The cherub that covereth" the mercy-seat is spoken of as anointed, with reference to <a href="/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.">Exodus 40:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the holy mountain of God.--</span>The prophet still has his mind upon Mount Zion (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>), but yet the words are ironically spoken of Tyre as a venerated sanctuary, rising up from the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Stones of fire.</span>--An obvious explanation of this expression, given by many writers, is that it refers to the brilliant sparkling jewels on the robes in which the king walked. But if this were the case, the expression would be a strange one, and the connection implies a deeper and a religious meaning. It is better, therefore, to understand the imagery as similar to that in <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>, and to suppose the prophet to have had in mind such a passage as <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, where a paved work of sapphire stone appears as beneath the feet of God, while His glory is "like a devouring fire." This would then be one of the ways in which the king of Tyre is ironically represented as assuming to himself God-like attributes. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The anointed cherub that covereth</span>. The word for "anointed" is not found elsewhere, but is cognate in form with that which is commonly so rendered. The Vulgate, however, tracing it to another root, gives <span class="accented">extentus et protegens</span>, and is followed by Luther, Gesenius, Ewald, and others. Keil and Hengstenberg accept "anointed." The sequence of thought seems to be as follows: The splendor-of the King of Tyre had suggested the idea of Eden the garden of God. This, in its turn, led on to that of the cherub that was the warder of that garden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). The Paradise of God is pictured as still existing, and the cherub - we remember how prominent the word and the thing had been in Ezekiel's thoughts (<a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-16</a>) - is there (according as we take the above words) either as its anointed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "consecrated," ruler, or as extending the protection of its overshadowing wings far and wide as the cherubim of the tabernacle extended their wings over the ark (comp. <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>). Those cherubim, we may remember, were actually anointed (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>). The King of Tyro boasted that he was, like them, consecrated to his office as king "by the grace of God." In that earthly Paradise the prophet saw the "holy mountain of God," the Olympus, so to speak, of the Hebrews, the throne of the Eternal (compare the Meru of India, the Albard of Iran, the Asgard of German poetry). Isaiah's words as to the King of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>) present a suggestive parallel. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the stones of fire.</span> The words receive their interpretation partly from <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; partly from <a href="/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 15</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8, 12</a>; <a href="/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>. The cherub's sword of fire is identified with the lightning-flash, and that in its turn with the thunderbolts of God. Out of the throne of God went thunders and lightnings (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The "Flammantia maenia mundi" of Lucretius (1. 73) offers a suggestive parallel. The King of Tyre, like the King of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>), is painted as exulting in that attribute of the Divine glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were anointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;&#353;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4473.htm">Strong's 4473: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps expanded or far-reaching wings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a guardian</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(has&#183;s&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
