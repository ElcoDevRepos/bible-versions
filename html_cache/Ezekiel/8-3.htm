The imagery of a hand suggests God's direct intervention. In biblical symbolism, the hand often represents power and authority (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). The act of being taken by the hair indicates a forceful and urgent action, emphasizing the seriousness of the vision Ezekiel is about to receive. This method of transportation is unique and underscores the divine nature of the encounter.<p><b>Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven</b><br>The Spirit here refers to the Holy Spirit, who plays a crucial role in guiding and revealing God's will to the prophets. Being lifted between earth and heaven signifies a transition from the physical realm to the spiritual, allowing Ezekiel to see things from God's perspective. This elevation is symbolic of receiving divine insight, similar to other biblical figures who experienced visions, such as John in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4:1-2</a>.<p><b>and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem</b><br>Ezekiel is transported in a vision to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. This city holds significant importance as the location of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The vision indicates a revelation concerning the spiritual state of Jerusalem, highlighting the city's central role in God's covenant with Israel. This transportation in a vision parallels other prophetic experiences, such as Daniel's visions in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>.<p><b>to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court</b><br>The north gate of the inner court of the Temple is significant because it was one of the main entrances used by worshippers. The inner court was a sacred area, reserved for priests and certain sacrificial rituals. The specific mention of the north gate may indicate the direction from which judgment or invasion would come, as historically, enemies often attacked Israel from the north (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>).<p><b>where the idol that provokes jealousy was seated</b><br>This phrase refers to an idolatrous image set up within the Temple precincts, an abomination in the eyes of God. The idol provokes God's jealousy because it represents the people's unfaithfulness to Him, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This idolatry is a recurring theme in Israel's history, leading to divine judgment.

Ezekiel did not actually leave Chaldaea at all, as is shown by <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm" title="Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.">Ezekiel 11:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The door of the inner gate.</span>--This is one of the gates which led from the court of the people to the court of the priests which was on a higher level. In the account of the building of the temple there is no mention of gates leading from the one to the other, but they would naturally have been placed there, as we know they were in the later temple of Herod. The particular gate was the one "which looketh toward the north," as the one by which the priests went directly to the great altar.<p><span class= "bld">The image of jealousy</span> is explained in the following clause, "which provoketh to jealousy." It is not necessary to consider "jealousy" as a proper name--the name of any particular heathen divinity--but rather as a descriptive name, an image which aroused the Divine indignation. It has even been thought that it is not meant to indicate any particular idol, but is only a picture to set forth the prevailing idolatry. It is, however, altogether probable that at this time there actually were heathen idols set up in the temple, and nothing could give a more vivid picture of the corruption of priests and people alike than the mention of their presence. Idolatry had been growing more general and more bold from the time of Solomon. He built places of worship for the various idols of his wives <span class= "ital">"</span>in the hill that is before Jerusalem" (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1Kings 11:7</a>); but Ahaz, under the influence of the Assyrian king, had placed an idolatrous altar in the temple itself, removing the brazen altar to make room (<a href="/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-16</a>), and Manasseh afterwards did the same (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4</a>). All the subsequent kings of Judah, except Josiah, were wicked men, and although this particular sin is not distinctly recorded of Zedekiah, yet it seems altogether likely that he too made use of the temple for idolatrous worship, and that Ezekiel in vision now saw his idols standing in the court.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The form of an hand</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>). For the mode of transit, see Bel and the Dragon, ver. 36. as probably a direct imitation. The touch of the "hand" was followed by the action of the Spirit, in visions which he knew to be more than dreams, visions that came from God (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). The word is not the same as that commonly used by Daniel (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), and often by Ezekiel himself (<a href="/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22, 23</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), but <span class="accented">mareh</span>, which implies a more direct act of intuition. The word appears again in <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, and in <a href="/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26, 27</a>, <span class="accented">et al. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To the door of the gate,</span> etc. From the first we trace the priest's familiarity with the structure of the temple. He is brought, as it were, after his journey in the spirit, <span class="cmt_word">to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh towards the north</span> (Revised Version). This is identified in ver. 5 with the "gate of the altar." It may probably also be identified with the "upper gate" of <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>; the "high gate" of <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; the "higher gate" of <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>, built by Jotham; the "new gate" of <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>. Obviously it was one of the most conspicuous portions of the temple, where the people gathered in large numbers. And here the prophet sees what he calls <span class="cmt_word">the image of jealousy</span>. The words that follow probably give his explanation of the strange phrase, not found elsewhere, though it might naturally be suggested by <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16, 21</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>. What this image was we can only conjecture. The word for "image" is a rare one, and is found only here and in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-7.htm">2 Chronicles 33:7, 15</a>. It may have been the Asherah (the "grove" of the Authorized Version), or conical stone, such as Manasseh had made and placed, with an altar dedicated to it, in the house of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3</a>), or one of Baal, or of Ashtaroth, or even of Tammuz (see ver. 14). As the word "grove" does not occur in Ezekiel, it may be sufficient to state that the <span class="accented">Ashera</span> was a pillar symbolical either of a goddess of the same name, or, as some think, of the Phoenician Astarte. The worship seems to have first become popular under Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>), and took deep root both in Israel and Judah. The cultus, as in <a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, seems to have been connected with the foulest licence, like that of the Babylonian Mylitta (Herod., 1:199; Baruch 6:43). The work of Josiah had clearly had but a temporary success, and the people had gone back to the confluent polytheism of the reign of Manasseh. In such a state of things the worst was possible.
