The mention of "two swinging panels" suggests a functional and aesthetic purpose, allowing for ease of access and movement. This design reflects the precision and orderliness that God desires in His dwelling place. The use of panels may also symbolize the dual nature of access to God&#8212;both open and closed, inviting yet requiring reverence. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such doors were common in significant buildings, indicating the importance of the space they protected.<p><b>There were two panels for one door and two for the other.</b><br>The repetition of the number two in the description of the doors may symbolize balance and harmony, reflecting the dual aspects of God's nature&#8212;justice and mercy. The detailed description underscores the importance of symmetry and order in God's design, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. This attention to detail in the temple's construction can be seen as a foreshadowing of the perfect order and harmony found in Christ, who is the ultimate temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).
