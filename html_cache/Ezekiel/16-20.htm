In the ancient Near Eastern context, children were considered a blessing from God, and the Israelites were expected to raise them in the knowledge and fear of the Lord. The act of taking these children, who were a gift from God, and dedicating them to idols represents a profound violation of their covenant with Him. This echoes the broader biblical theme of Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen in <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, where Israel is depicted as an unfaithful spouse.<p><b>and sacrificed them as food to idols.</b><br>Child sacrifice was a practice associated with pagan worship, particularly among the Canaanites, and was strictly forbidden in Israelite law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The reference to "food to idols" underscores the abomination of the act, as it not only involved the murder of innocents but also the perversion of worship meant for God alone. This practice is historically linked to the worship of deities like Molech, where children were offered in sacrificial rituals. The severity of this sin is emphasized in <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, where God expresses His abhorrence for such practices.<p><b>Was your prostitution not enough?</b><br>The metaphor of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>, <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a>). This rhetorical question underscores the gravity of Israel's spiritual adultery, suggesting that their idolatrous practices were already egregious, and yet they compounded their sin by sacrificing their children. The use of "prostitution" conveys the idea of Israel selling itself to foreign gods, abandoning the exclusive relationship they were meant to have with the Lord. This imagery is also a type pointing to the need for a faithful bride, ultimately fulfilled in the Church's relationship with Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, depicted metaphorically as an unfaithful wife in this chapter, engaging in idolatry and spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>False gods that the Israelites worshipped, often involving detestable practices such as child sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Refers to the children of Israel, whom they sacrificed to idols, highlighting the depth of their apostasy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitution.htm">Prostitution</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God through idolatry and alliances with pagan nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gravity_of_idolatry.htm">The Gravity of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of false gods but a betrayal of our covenant relationship with God.

By tying child sacrifice to &#8220;prostitution,&#8221; the LORD shows that idolatry is never merely a private lapse; it devours what is most precious.
