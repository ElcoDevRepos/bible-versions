In the context of Ezekiel, it points to a future moment when God will act decisively on behalf of His people. This aligns with the prophetic tradition where "that day" signifies a time of judgment or restoration, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Joel.<p><b>I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel</b><br>The "horn" symbolizes strength and power, often associated with kingship and deliverance. In biblical imagery, a horn represents the might of a ruler or nation. This prophecy suggests the rise of a leader or a period of empowerment for Israel. It can be connected to the Messianic expectation, where the "horn" is seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate deliverer and king from the line of David, as echoed in <a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>.<p><b>and I will open your mouth to speak among them</b><br>This indicates a restoration of Ezekiel's prophetic voice, which had been silenced as a sign to the people (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>). The opening of the mouth signifies the return of God's direct communication through His prophet, emphasizing the importance of divine revelation and guidance. It underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpiece, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><br>A recurring theme in Ezekiel, this phrase underscores the purpose of God's actions: to reveal His sovereignty and identity to Israel and the nations. It reflects the covenant relationship where recognition of God's lordship is central. This acknowledgment is not just intellectual but involves a relational and covenantal understanding, as seen in the repeated declarations throughout Ezekiel (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7, 7</a>:4).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

&#8220;In that day&#8221; roots the promise in a specific, God-appointed moment, not a vague hope (cf. <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord&#8217;s timing is flawless, we can read this as a literal pledge that will unfold exactly when He decides (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also signals a turning point: judgment on Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/29-1.htm">Ezekiel 29:1&#8211;20</a>) gives way to restoration for Israel, highlighting God&#8217;s faithfulness even in seasons of discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;horn&#8221; pictures strength and kingship; God Himself produces it, so the power is divine in origin (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sprout&#8221; conveys fresh growth after exile&#8212;new leadership rising from seeming barrenness (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately this points forward to Messiah Jesus, Israel&#8217;s enduring King (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-69</a>), yet it also assures the exiles of tangible political restoration along the way (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Takeaway: When God pledges to raise up strength, no foreign empire can thwart it; His people can expect literal deliverance and renewed national identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will open your mouth to speak among them</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel had experienced periods of enforced silence (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>; 24:27), a sign of judgment on the house of Israel.<p>&#8226; Here God promises to lift that silence, letting the prophet proclaim hope instead of only warning (<a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implication: God equips His servants with words precisely when His people are ready to hear; ministry effectiveness rests on His timing, not ours (<a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; For the exiles, hearing their prophet speak again meant God&#8217;s favor was returning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8226; This refrain pulses through Ezekiel (e.g., 6:7; 36:23; 39:28), underscoring God&#8217;s purpose in both judgment and restoration.<p>&#8226; By combining a sprouting horn and a reopened mouth, the Lord reveals Himself as both sovereign King and compassionate Redeemer.<p>&#8226; Recognition of Yahweh&#8217;s identity is the goal; every act&#8212;discipline, deliverance, prophetic word&#8212;drives His people to firsthand acknowledgment (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal fulfillment of these promises cements God&#8217;s reputation not only among Israel but before watching nations (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a> offers a fourfold assurance: at God&#8217;s chosen &#8220;day,&#8221; He will personally raise up powerful, royal strength for Israel, unseal Ezekiel&#8217;s mouth with messages of hope, and through these acts lead the nation to unmistakable awareness of His lordship. The verse stands as a concrete pledge that even after judgment, God remains faithful to restore, empower, and reveal Himself to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">In that day.</span>--The tenses here change to the future, indicating that if the conquest of Egypt had already taken place, its consequences to Israel were to be only gradually developed.
