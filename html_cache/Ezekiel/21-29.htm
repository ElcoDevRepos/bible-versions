In the context of Ezekiel, these false prophets claimed to speak for God but were actually delivering messages that contradicted the true warnings given by genuine prophets like Ezekiel. This is reminiscent of the warnings against false prophets found in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>. The presence of false prophets was a significant issue in Israel, as they often provided a false sense of security, leading the people away from repentance and obedience to God.<p><b>and lying divinations about you</b><br>Divination was a practice condemned by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), yet it was prevalent among the nations surrounding Israel and had infiltrated Israel itself. These lying divinations were attempts to predict the future or gain insight through means not sanctioned by God, often involving occult practices. The false prophets used these methods to deceive the people, claiming divine insight that was actually rooted in falsehood. This highlights the spiritual corruption and the departure from true worship that characterized the period leading up to the Babylonian exile.<p><b>to be placed on the necks of the wicked who are slain</b><br>This imagery suggests a burden or yoke placed upon those who are destined for judgment. The "necks of the wicked" symbolizes those who have persistently rebelled against God and are now facing the consequences of their actions. The phrase indicates that the false prophecies and divinations have contributed to the downfall of these individuals, as they were led astray and did not heed the true warnings of impending judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where the wicked ultimately face retribution for their actions (<a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>).<p><b>whose day has come</b><br>This phrase signifies the arrival of the appointed time for judgment. In the prophetic literature, "the day" often refers to a time of divine intervention, either for deliverance or judgment. Here, it is a day of reckoning for the wicked, fulfilling the warnings given by true prophets like Ezekiel. This concept is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a> and <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, where the "day of the Lord" is depicted as a time of both judgment and salvation.<p><b>the time of their final punishment</b><br>The finality of this punishment underscores the seriousness of the judgment being pronounced. It is not merely a temporary setback but a conclusive act of divine justice. This reflects the biblical principle that God's patience has limits, and persistent rebellion will ultimately lead to irrevocable consequences. The notion of final punishment is also seen in the New Testament, where it is associated with the ultimate judgment at the end of the age (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).
