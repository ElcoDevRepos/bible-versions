In the context of Ezekiel, it underscores the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for God, emphasizing the authority and authenticity of the message. The phrase is common in prophetic literature, highlighting the direct communication between God and His prophets (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>).<p><b>came to me</b><br>This personalizes the message, showing that Ezekiel is the chosen recipient of God's word. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His prophets, where God entrusts them with His messages for the people. Ezekiel's role as a prophet is affirmed through these divine encounters, which are a hallmark of his ministry (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>).<p><b>saying</b><br>This introduces the content of the divine message. It prepares the reader for the specific instructions or revelations that follow. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>, the message pertains to the judgment against Sidon, a city known for its pride and opposition to God&#8217;s people.
