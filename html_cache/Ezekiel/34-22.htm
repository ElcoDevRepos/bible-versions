In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile, suffering under poor leadership, both politically and spiritually. This promise of salvation reflects God's commitment to deliver His people from oppression and misguidance. The imagery of God as a shepherd is consistent throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd, indicating a messianic fulfillment of this promise.<p><b>and they will no longer be prey</b><br>Here, the focus is on protection and security. Historically, Israel had been vulnerable to surrounding nations, often falling victim to invasions and exploitation. This assurance speaks to a future where God's people will be safe from external threats. Theologically, it points to the ultimate safety found in God's kingdom, where believers are secure from spiritual adversaries. This connects to <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16-17</a>, where the Lamb shepherds His people, ensuring they are no longer harmed.<p><b>I will judge between one sheep and another</b><br>This phrase indicates a process of discernment and justice within the community of God's people. It suggests that not all who are part of the flock are faithful or righteous. This internal judgment is reminiscent of the parable of the sheep and the goats in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where Christ separates the righteous from the unrighteous. It underscores the idea that God knows the hearts of individuals and will hold each accountable, ensuring that true justice prevails within His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, God promises to intervene directly to save His people, portraying Himself as the Good Shepherd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, who have been scattered and mistreated by unfaithful leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds_of_israel.htm">Shepherds of Israel</a></b><br>The leaders and rulers who have failed to care for the people, leading to their suffering and dispersion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine act of distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked within the community, ensuring justice and protection for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_care.htm">God's Sovereignty and Care</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the lives of His people, ensuring their protection and well-being.

The context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a> exposes unfaithful shepherd-leaders who exploited the flock (vv. 2-10). Here the Lord steps in as the Good Shepherd:<p>&#8226; He acts, not delegates&#8212;mirroring <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, &#8220;The LORD is my Shepherd; I shall not want.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The rescue is certain and complete, anticipating the ultimate salvation accomplished by Christ, &#8220;the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It affirms God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness first hinted at in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>, where He said, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction&#8230; and I have come down to rescue them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For believers today, this rescue guarantees eternal security (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>) and present-tense deliverance from sin&#8217;s dominion (<a href="/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they will no longer be prey</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s salvation has a tangible result: the flock will not be easy pickings for predators again.<p>&#8226; &#8220;No longer&#8221; signals a decisive break with past vulnerability&#8212;echoed in <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16-17</a> where the redeemed &#8220;will never again hunger or thirst.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Predators symbolize oppressive leaders and spiritual forces (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>); God shields His people just as He promised in <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>, &#8220;I will be a wall of fire around her.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practical reassurance flows from passages like <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>, &#8220;The Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This protection invites believers to rest, much like the still waters of <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>&#8212;living under the Shepherd&#8217;s vigilant eye eliminates fear (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will judge between one sheep and another</b><p>Salvation and safety do not cancel accountability.

Today, His Word and Spirit sift motives and actions (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), urging believers toward humble service and authentic love (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/34-22.htm">Ezekiel 34:22</a> offers a threefold promise: God Himself rescues His people, shields them from future predation, and preserves purity within the flock through righteous judgment.
