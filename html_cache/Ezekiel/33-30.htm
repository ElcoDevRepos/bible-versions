It is also a title Jesus used for Himself, highlighting His identification with humanity (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>). This phrase underscores the prophet's role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>your people are talking about you</b><br>Ezekiel's audience, the exiled Israelites, are discussing him, indicating that his messages have captured their attention. This reflects the tension between the prophet and the people, who often resisted his warnings. It also shows the dual nature of a prophet's role: being both a messenger and a subject of scrutiny.<p><b>near the city walls and in the doorways of their houses</b><br>The city walls and doorways were common places for public discourse in ancient times. This setting suggests that Ezekiel's messages were a topic of widespread discussion, not confined to private or religious settings. It highlights the communal nature of the society and the importance of public opinion.<p><b>One speaks to another, each saying to his brother</b><br>This phrase indicates a communal sharing of information, emphasizing the oral culture of the time. It reflects the way messages were spread and discussed among the people, showing the importance of community in understanding and responding to prophetic messages.<p><b>&#8216;Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD!&#8217;</b><br>The invitation to hear a message from the LORD suggests a recognition of the divine origin of Ezekiel's prophecies. It implies a curiosity or interest in what God is communicating, though the context of the chapter suggests that this interest may be superficial. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of hearing and responding to God's word, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which calls for not just hearing but doing the word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

It underscores both Ezekiel&#8217;s humanity and his divine appointment as watchman. God singles him out, reminding him that the people&#8217;s response&#8212;whether positive or negative&#8212;does not change his calling. Like Paul later told Timothy, &#8220;Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>), Ezekiel must stay faithful regardless of public opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your people are talking about you</b><p>The exiles were discussing Ezekiel, not necessarily his God-given message. Jeremiah faced similar whispering (<a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>), and our Lord experienced crowds intrigued by Him yet unmoved to obedience (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>). The verse exposes the difference between interest in the messenger and submission to the Lord. Genuine faith does more than assess the preacher; it heeds God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>near the city walls and in the doorways of their houses</b><p>Public and private spaces alike buzzed with conversation&#8212;&#8220;those who sit at the gate mock me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-12.htm">Psalm 69:12</a>). Doorposts once intended for the writing of God&#8217;s commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>) became casual forums for chatter. The setting hints at superficiality: conversation at the gate easily drifts into gossip, while talk on the threshold seldom penetrates the heart. Contrast this with Jesus teaching &#8220;in our streets&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-26.htm">Luke 13:26</a>) where listeners still failed to repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One speaks to another</b><p>Word-of-mouth spreads quickly. At times this is positive (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, &#8220;those who feared the LORD spoke with one another&#8221;), but here it carries a warning similar to <a href="/proverbs/11-9.htm">Proverbs 11:9</a>, &#8220;With his mouth the godless destroys his neighbor.&#8221; Mere circulation of religious talk is no substitute for personal obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each saying to his brother</b><p>Familiar, brother-to-brother language suggests friendly invitation, yet it can mask complacency&#8212;like Israel in <a href="/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a>, casually turning prophetic words into a social topic. Family ties do not guarantee spiritual sincerity (<a href="/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a>). Everyone must personally bow to God&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD!</b><p>Their words sound commendable, echoing <a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>, &#8220;Come and hear, all you who fear God,&#8221; and <a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44</a>, where a whole city gathers to hear Paul. Yet <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a> (the next verse) reveals motives: they listen &#8220;but they will not do them.&#8221; The people treat God&#8217;s word as entertainment&#8212;itching ears desiring stimulation more than transformation (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>). True hearing involves repentance (<a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>; <a href="/mark/4-20.htm">Mark 4:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a> exposes a crowd fascinated by spiritual conversation yet unmoved to obey. They discuss the prophet, assemble in public and private places, invite one another with religious enthusiasm&#8212;but stop short of repentance. The verse challenges every generation: admiration for preaching is meaningless without submission to the Lord who speaks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">The children of thy people.--</span>The few remaining verses of this chapter are concerned with those in exile--perhaps not so much those who had been with Ezekiel all along as fresh captives of a worse moral character now just brought from Jerusalem. Yet of them all alike it was still true that they were much more ready to listen with deferential air to the words of the prophet than to take them to their hearts and act upon them in their life. The prophet is here warned (<a href="/context/ezekiel/33-30.htm" title="Also, you son of man, the children of your people still are talking against you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the LORD.">Ezekiel 33:30-33</a>) not to be misled by the apparent compliance of the people, as he had been before strengthened against their opposition (<a href="/context/ezekiel/3-8.htm" title="Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.">Ezekiel 3:8-9</a>); but it must have carried a pang deep into his heart to know how superficial was the effect of those labours to which he had devoted himself with such faithfulness.<p><span class= "bld">Against thee.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of thee.</span> The people are not represented as opposed to Ezekiel, but rather as enjoying his eloquence, and talking about him as they met one another, but without any serious effort to follow his counsels--much like the treatment of a popular preacher by his people at the present day.<p>By <span class= "bld">the walls and</span> in the <span class= "bld">doors.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">within the walls.</span> The meaning is, both privately and publicly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of thy people</span>. The words, like those of <a href="/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and Ezekiel 20:1, 49, throw light on the prophet's relations to his people. Now that the long silence was broken, and the prophet spoke with greater freedom than he had ever done before, he acquired a fresh notoriety. The character of his last utterance, vindicating, as it might seem, the claim of the exiles to "possess the land," as against that of the remnant "in the wastes," may even have made him popular. The Authorized Version <span class="cmt_word">against</span> is misleading; read, with the margin and the Revised Version, <span class="accented">about</span>. There was for the time no open hostility. They talked much, in places of private or public resort, of the prophet's new action. Each invited his neighbor to go and hear the prophet as he spake to them his message from Jehovah. And they came <span class="cmt_word">as the people cometh</span>, in crowds, even <span class="cmt_word">as my people</span>, the people of Jehovah, with reverent gestures and listening eagerly. Never before, we may well believe, had the prophet had so large or so promising a congregation. But he was taught to look below the surface and to read their thoughts, and there he read, as preachers of all ages have too often read after him, that they were hearers, and not doers (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>; <a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-25</a>).
