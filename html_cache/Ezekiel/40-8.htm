This reflects the divine order and holiness required in worship. Measuring is a recurring theme in Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing God's sovereignty and the establishment of His standards (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3-5</a>). It also echoes the measuring of the New Jerusalem in <a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15-17</a>, indicating a future fulfillment and the perfection of God's kingdom.<p><b>the portico of the gateway:</b><br>The portico, or porch, is an architectural feature that serves as an entrance to the temple complex. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, porticos were common and often signified a place of transition from the secular to the sacred. The gateway represents access to God's presence, emphasizing the importance of approaching God with reverence. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "gate" or "door" through which believers enter into fellowship with God (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><b>inside;</b><br>The term "inside" indicates the inner part of the temple complex, suggesting a movement towards the heart of worship and the presence of God. This progression from the outer to the inner areas of the temple mirrors the spiritual journey of drawing closer to God. It also highlights the exclusivity and sanctity of the inner temple areas, reserved for those who are consecrated. This concept is paralleled in the New Testament, where believers are called to draw near to God with a sincere heart (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_measuring_rod.htm">The Man with the Measuring Rod</a></b><br>An angelic figure who guides Ezekiel through the vision, measuring the temple's dimensions, symbolizing divine order and precision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, representing God's presence among His people.
