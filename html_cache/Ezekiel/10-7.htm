In the context of Ezekiel, they are part of the divine chariot-throne vision, symbolizing God's majesty and holiness. The act of reaching out signifies divine initiative and action, emphasizing the cherubim's role as executors of God's will.<p><b>and took some of the fire that was among them.</b><br>Fire in biblical terms often represents God's judgment and purification. The fire among the cherubim indicates the presence of God's holy and purifying power. This imagery connects to other instances in scripture where fire is used as a tool of divine judgment, such as in Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the burning bush (Exodus 3).<p><b>And he put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen,</b><br>The man clothed in linen is often interpreted as a figure of purity and righteousness, possibly an angelic being or a priestly figure. Linen garments were worn by priests in the temple, symbolizing holiness and service to God. This act of transferring fire signifies the passing of divine judgment or mission from the heavenly realm to the earthly.<p><b>who received it and went out.</b><br>The act of receiving and going out indicates obedience and the execution of a divine mandate. This phrase suggests a mission or task being carried out, likely related to the judgment upon Jerusalem. It reflects the theme of divine commission seen throughout scripture, where God's messengers are sent to fulfill His purposes, as seen with prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.
