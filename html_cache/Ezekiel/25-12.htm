It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This underscores the seriousness and certainty of the message that follows.<p><b>Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah:</b><br>Edom, descendants of Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel, descendants of Jacob. This hostility is rooted in the sibling rivalry between Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23-34</a>). Edom's vengeful actions likely refer to their participation in or support of the Babylonian attacks on Judah, as well as their rejoicing over Judah's downfall (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). This animosity is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the consequences of familial discord and national enmity.<p><b>and in so doing incurred grievous guilt:</b><br>Edom's actions are not only seen as hostile but also as morally culpable. The term "grievous guilt" indicates a severe breach of divine law and justice. This guilt is compounded by Edom's betrayal of kinship ties and their failure to show compassion. The prophetic literature often highlights that God holds nations accountable for their actions, especially when they act unjustly or with malice (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11-12</a>).

(For other prophecies against Edom, see <a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18, 19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-12</a>; <a href="/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span>. The name, which signifies "South," was probably applied to a district - twice, here and in <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8</a>, coupled with Dedan. In <a href="/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20, 21</a> the cry of the inhabitants of Teman is said to have been "heard in the Red Sea," and this determines its geographical position, as being, in accordance with its name, the southern region of Edom. In <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a> we have Eliphaz the Temanite as one of the patriarch's friends, and the same name appears as that of a son of Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>). In Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit</span>.) Teman is named as famous for its wisdom. Dedan is named as a grandson of Cash in <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>, and of Abraham by Keturah in <a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>. It has been inferred from this that there were two branches of the nation, one on the shores of the Persian Gulf, nomadic and trading, as in the "travelling companies" of Dedanim (<a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15, 20</a>); the other settled in the territory of the Edomites ('Dict. Bible'). The latter is that to which Ezekiel refers. A various punctuation gives, with a better sense, "From Teman even unto Dedan they shall fall by the sword." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Edom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_123.htm">Strong's 123: </a> </span><span class="str2">The name of a condiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">acted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">vengefully</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bin&#183;q&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
