This phrase indicates a direct command from God to Ezekiel, highlighting the prophet's responsibility to communicate God's message to the Israelites. The term "your people" refers to the exiled Israelites in Babylon, emphasizing Ezekiel's connection to them and his role as their spiritual leader.<p><b>The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression;</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of individual responsibility and accountability before God. In the context of the Old Testament, righteousness often involved adherence to the Law and covenantal faithfulness. However, this statement warns that past righteousness cannot save someone if they turn to sin. It reflects the broader biblical theme that each person is accountable for their actions, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a>.<p><b>Neither will the wickedness of the wicked man cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness.</b><br>This highlights the possibility of repentance and redemption. The wicked, upon genuine repentance, can find forgiveness and a new path. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where repentance and faith in Christ lead to salvation (e.g., <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>, <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). It emphasizes God's mercy and willingness to forgive those who turn from their sinful ways.<p><b>Nor will the righteous man be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins.</b><br>This reiterates the idea that past righteousness cannot compensate for present sin. It serves as a warning against complacency and self-righteousness, reminding believers that ongoing faithfulness and obedience are necessary. This principle is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the need for continual faith and repentance (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). It also points to the insufficiency of human righteousness and the need for divine grace, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
