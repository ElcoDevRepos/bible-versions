In the context of Ezekiel, God is speaking about the impending judgment on Jerusalem due to its idolatry and rebellion. Sparing a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in the stories of Noah and Lot, where God preserves a faithful few. This remnant theology underscores God's grace and the hope of restoration.<p><b>from sword and famine and plague</b><br>These three calamities are common judgments mentioned throughout the Old Testament, often used by God to bring about repentance. The sword represents warfare, famine indicates a lack of sustenance, and plague suggests disease. These were real threats in the ancient Near East, often resulting from sieges and invasions. The triple threat emphasizes the severity of the judgment and the comprehensive nature of God's discipline.<p><b>so that in the nations to which they go</b><br>The dispersion of the Israelites among the nations is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This exile serves a dual purpose: it is both a punishment and a means of spreading the knowledge of God among the Gentiles. The scattering of the Israelites foreshadows the later dispersion of the early Christians, who spread the Gospel throughout the Roman Empire.<p><b>they can recount all their abominations</b><br>The recounting of abominations refers to the acknowledgment of sin and idolatry that led to their judgment. This confession is crucial for repentance and restoration. It also serves as a testimony to the nations of God's righteousness and justice. The public acknowledgment of sin is a theme seen in the confessions of Daniel and Nehemiah, who intercede for their people.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a key theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the recognition of God's sovereignty and holiness. The acknowledgment of God as LORD is the ultimate goal of His actions, whether in judgment or mercy. This recognition is not just intellectual but relational, calling for a return to covenant faithfulness. It points to the eschatological hope where all nations will acknowledge God, as seen in the prophetic visions of Isaiah and Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, representing God's judgment and the consequences of their sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword,_famine,_and_plague.htm">Sword, Famine, and Plague</a></b><br>Instruments of God's judgment used to discipline and purify His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The foreign lands where the Israelites are scattered, serving as witnesses to God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>Despite the severity of judgment, God spares a remnant, demonstrating His control over history and His mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_preservation.htm">Purpose of Preservation</a></b><br>The remnant is preserved to testify to God's justice and their own sinfulness, serving as a witness to the nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The passage underscores the serious consequences of disobedience, urging believers to live in accordance with God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_judgment.htm">Hope in Judgment</a></b><br>Even in times of discipline, God provides hope and a future for those who remain faithful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_nations.htm">Witness to the Nations</a></b><br>Believers are called to be witnesses of God's truth and grace, sharing their testimonies with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_12_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 12:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_16_Mercy_in_Judgment.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:16 demonstrate God's mercy amidst judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Ezekiel_12_16_remnant.htm">What lessons can we learn from the spared remnant in Ezekiel 12:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_16_and_God_s_covenant_link.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:16 connect to God's covenant promises in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_use_the_remnant_concept_now.htm">In what ways can we apply the concept of a remnant today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_16_Inspire_repentance.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:16 encourage repentance and faithfulness in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_16_Why_spare_a_remnant.htm">What does Ezekiel 12:16 reveal about God's purpose for sparing a remnant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_12_16_Divine_justice_vs_mercy.htm">How does Ezekiel 12:16 challenge our understanding of divine justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_spare_some_in_Ezekiel_12_16.htm">Why does God choose to spare some in Ezekiel 12:16 despite widespread judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_are_the_four_horsemen.htm">Who are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_findings_confirm_ezekiel_14_13-21.htm">Are there any archaeological findings that confirm the severe judgments (famine, wild beasts, sword, plague) predicted in Ezekiel 14:13-21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_ezekiel_5_11-12's_punishment.htm">In Ezekiel 5:11-12, how can we reconcile the promised devastating punishment (famine, sword, and scattering) with accounts from other biblical or secular sources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_view_re-enslavement_vs._slavery.htm">Jeremiah 34:11-17 -

Their exile positions them to confess their sins openly among the nations, turning personal failure into a global witness. Through this blend of justice and mercy, the remnant&#8212;and all who hear&#8212;come to know that He alone is the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">May declare all their abominations.</span>--This they were to do, that the false impression that God was unable to protect His people might be removed from the minds of the heathen, and the truth that He was punishing them for their sins be made known. They should do it both by word of mouth (as in <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-8.htm" title="And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?">Jeremiah 22:8-9</a>), and also by their conduct (as in <a href="/context/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22-23</a>).
