Historically, Israel often sought Egypt's help against powerful empires like Assyria and Babylon. This reliance is seen in passages such as <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>, where God warns against seeking Egypt's aid instead of trusting Him. The imagery of taking hold with hands suggests a desperate grasp for stability and security.<p><b>you splintered, tearing all their shoulders</b><br>The metaphor of Egypt as a splintering staff highlights its unreliability and the harm caused to those who depend on it. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a staff symbolized support and strength. However, Egypt's failure to provide the expected support led to injury and disappointment for Israel, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>, where Egypt is described as a broken reed. The tearing of shoulders signifies the physical and emotional strain resulting from misplaced trust.<p><b>when they leaned on you, you broke</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete failure of Egypt as a dependable ally. Leaning implies trust and dependence, and Egypt's breaking represents its inability to uphold its promises. This failure is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where reliance on foreign powers instead of God leads to downfall. The breaking of Egypt is also prophetic, foreshadowing its eventual defeat and subjugation by Babylon, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10-12</a>.<p><b>and their backs were wrenched</b><br>The wrenching of backs symbolizes the severe consequences and suffering experienced by Israel due to their reliance on Egypt. This imagery conveys the idea of being burdened and oppressed, reflecting the physical and spiritual toll of trusting in human power rather than divine guidance. The wrenched backs can also be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate burden and suffering on behalf of humanity, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
