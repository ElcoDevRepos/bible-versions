In <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, thorns and thistles are part of the curse upon the ground after the Fall, representing hardship and struggle. Here, they symbolize the nations and peoples who have been a source of pain and persecution for Israel. The promise that Israel will no longer face these "briers" or "thorns" suggests a future time of peace and security, free from the harassment of hostile neighbors. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of restoration and divine protection.<p><b>from all around them who treat them with contempt.</b><br>The phrase "from all around them" indicates the surrounding nations that have historically been adversaries to Israel, such as the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. These nations often treated Israel with contempt, as seen throughout the historical books of the Old Testament. The contempt could be due to Israel's unique covenant relationship with God, which set them apart from other nations. This promise of relief from contempt suggests a reversal of fortunes, where Israel will no longer be scorned or oppressed by its neighbors. This aligns with prophecies of Israel's future exaltation and the subjugation of its enemies, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.&#8217;</b><br>This concluding phrase emphasizes the recognition of God's sovereignty and power. The repeated biblical theme of knowing that He is the Lord underscores the purpose behind God's actions&#8212;whether in judgment or blessing. In Ezekiel, this phrase often follows declarations of divine intervention, serving as a reminder that God's ultimate goal is to reveal Himself to His people and the nations. The acknowledgment of God as "the Lord GOD" signifies His authority and covenantal faithfulness. This recognition is not just intellectual but relational, calling Israel and the nations to acknowledge His rightful place as the sovereign ruler. This theme is echoed in other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God's acts lead to a deeper understanding and acknowledgment of His divine nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who have experienced both judgment and restoration throughout biblical history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorn_and_briar.htm">Thorn and Briar</a></b><br>Metaphorical language used to describe the hostile nations surrounding Israel, causing them distress and suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>The surrounding nations that have historically been adversaries to Israel, often leading them into idolatry and conflict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises deliverance and vindication for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, who conveyed God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty and Deliverance</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and will ultimately deliver His people from their adversaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Israel's suffering was often a result of their disobedience and idolatry, reminding us of the importance of faithfulness to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_and_restoration.htm">Hope and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite past judgments, God promises restoration and peace for His people, offering hope for the future.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_authority.htm">Recognizing God's Authority</a></b><br>The ultimate purpose of God's actions is that His people will know and acknowledge Him as the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_peace_with_neighbors.htm">Living in Peace with Neighbors</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live at peace with those around us, trusting God to handle conflicts and adversities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_28_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 28:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_God_s_shield_from_foes.htm">How does Ezekiel 28:24 illustrate God's protection against hostile neighbors?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_no_pricking_brier_in_life.htm">What does "no longer a pricking brier" signify in a believer's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_s_relevance_today.htm">How can we apply Ezekiel 28:24 to modern-day spiritual challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_Psalm_91_God_s_promises.htm">What connections exist between Ezekiel 28:24 and God's promises in Psalm 91?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_Faith_in_God_s_deliverance.htm">How does understanding Ezekiel 28:24 strengthen our faith in God's deliverance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_historical_context.htm">What is the historical context of Ezekiel 28:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_28_24_s_link_to_Tyre_prophecy.htm">How does Ezekiel 28:24 relate to the prophecy against Tyre?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_pricking_briers.htm">What is the significance of "pricking briers" in Ezekiel 28:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_create_satan_knowing_he'd_rebel.htm">Why did God create Satan if He knew he would rebel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_should_wives_treat_husbands_biblically.htm">What is Satan's role according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/ezekiel_18_24_vs._secure_salvation.htm">Ezekiel 18:24 -

Compare <a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>, where Ephraim and Judah cease their rivalry, and <a href="/zephaniah/3-15.htm">Zephaniah 3:15</a>, &#8220;The LORD has taken away your punishment&#8230; never again will you fear any harm.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a painful thorn</b><p>&#8226; The repetition intensifies the idea: no more stinging persecution. David used similar language for enemies who &#8220;cannot be taken in the hand&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God promises complete removal of the torment, not just a reduction.
