Forgetting these "days of your youth" implies a neglect of the foundational experiences and commitments that defined Israel as God's chosen people. In biblical terms, remembering is not just a mental exercise but involves active loyalty and obedience. The failure to remember signifies a spiritual amnesia that leads to unfaithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>, where Israel is warned not to forget God after entering the Promised Land.<p><b>but enraged Me with all these things</b><br>The "things" refer to the idolatry and spiritual adultery that Israel engaged in, as detailed earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>. This behavior is likened to a wife being unfaithful to her husband, which in the context of the covenant, is a grave offense. The language of "enraged" indicates God's righteous anger, a theme consistent with the prophetic literature where God&#8217;s wrath is provoked by Israel&#8217;s persistent sinfulness (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>I will surely bring your deeds down upon your own head</b><br>This phrase indicates the principle of divine retribution, where the consequences of one's actions are visited upon them. It echoes the biblical concept of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The imagery of deeds coming down upon one's head suggests an inescapable judgment that is both personal and deserved. This is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration underscores the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes both the sovereignty and the covenantal relationship God has with Israel. It is a reminder that the pronouncement is not from the prophet alone but from God Himself, ensuring its fulfillment.<p><b>Have you not committed this lewdness on top of all your other abominations?</b><br>The term "lewdness" refers to the moral and spiritual corruption that Israel engaged in, often associated with idolatry and the accompanying immoral practices. The phrase "on top of all your other abominations" suggests a cumulative effect of sin, where one transgression is added to another, increasing the severity of Israel's guilt. This echoes the warnings in <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>, where the land itself is defiled by such abominations, leading to expulsion. The rhetorical question serves to convict Israel of their undeniable guilt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The word for <span class= "ital">wickedness </span>is the especial word used for one who tolerates sin in another who is under his control (see <a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm" title="Do not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.">Leviticus 19:29</a>). God represents that it would be wrong to allow Israel's sin to go unpunished. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast not remembered</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). There is, so to speak, a certain dawn of tenderness in the new form of reproach, as compared with the sternness of what had gone before, and this in itself implies the pity which is the ground of hope. <span class="cmt_word">Fretted</span>. Ezra (<a href="/ezra/5-12.htm">Ezra 5:12</a>) uses the same word, there rendered "provoke." Had Ezekiel's use of it stamped it as the right word for confession? <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not commit,</span> etc. The Vulgate follows a reading which gives, "I have not done according to thy lewdness," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the guilt had deserved a greater punishment. The Revised Version margin gives, "Hast then not committed," etc.? The word for "lewdness" ("lewd way" in ver. 27) is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it eleven times. Elsewhere it is translated "wickedness" (<a href="/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "lewdness" in <a href="/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>. It conveys always the sense of a guilt that revolts and shocks us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">remember</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7733;art)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your youth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;&#183;ra&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
