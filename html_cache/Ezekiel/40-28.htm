In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this represents a deeper spiritual journey. The "south gate" is one of the three gates leading into the inner court, symbolizing access and entry into a closer relationship with God. The south gate's mention may also have geographical significance, as the south often represents warmth and light in biblical symbolism. This movement into the inner court can be seen as a type of Christ's work, bringing believers into a closer communion with God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where believers are encouraged to draw near to God with a sincere heart.<p><b>and he measured the south gate</b><br>The act of measuring signifies God's order and precision, reflecting His sovereignty and the importance of structure in worship. Measuring also implies ownership and the establishment of boundaries, as seen in <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11:1-2</a>, where the temple is measured to signify God's protection and claim over His people. This measurement underscores the idea that every aspect of worship and the temple is under divine scrutiny and care.<p><b>it had the same measurements as the others</b><br>This phrase emphasizes uniformity and consistency in God's design, suggesting that each gate, and by extension, each aspect of worship, holds equal importance in the eyes of God. The repetition of measurements throughout Ezekiel's vision highlights the perfection and completeness of God's plan. This uniformity can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging nature, as stated in <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, and the equality of access to God provided through Christ, as noted in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of the vision described in this passage.

The guiding angel escorts the prophet from the outer area to the inner court of the future temple.<p>&#8226; The inner court represents a deeper approach to God&#8217;s holy presence, much like the step from the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies in Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Progressive access mirrors the invitation believers have to &#8220;draw near with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; It also anticipates the millennial period when redeemed Israel will worship in a restored sanctuary, fulfilling promises such as <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26-28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the south gate</b><p>The route matters.

This and the other gates of this court are essentially the same, and require the same changes of translation as in the case of the outer gates. The same plan will serve for both, remembering that it must be reversed, the porches of one set of gates facing the porches of the other set; of course the steps led to the porches of the inner gates instead of to the opposite end.
