Measurements in biblical texts often symbolize God's exactness and the importance of following His divine plan.

The gateway serves as a point of entry, representing the way to approach God. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, the temple's structure reflects the holiness and separation required to approach God, reminiscent of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. The outer court's design may also foreshadow the New Testament concept of the Church as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>facing north</b><br>The direction north may have specific significance, as it was often associated with judgment and invasion in biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>). The northern gate's orientation could symbolize vigilance and readiness against spiritual adversaries.

This was in all respects similar to that upon the east, though its description proceeds in the reverse order, beginning with the three "chambers," or lodges, on each side of the footway (ver. 21), going on to the "posts," "arches," and "windows," and ending with the outside steps, seven in number (ver. 22), which are here first mentioned in connection with the gates. Its dimensions were the same as those of the "first" gate, fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad. It stood exactly in front of a corresponding gate into the inner court, and the distance between the two gates was, as before, a hundred cubits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also measured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4058.htm">Strong's 4058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch, to measure, to be extended</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the length</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;k&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_753.htm">Strong's 753: </a> </span><span class="str2">Length</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and width</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#601;&#183;b&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7341.htm">Strong's 7341: </a> </span><span class="str2">Breadth, width</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the gateway</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;&#353;a&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8179.htm">Strong's 8179: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, gate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the outer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2435.htm">Strong's 2435: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, wall side, exterior, secular</span><br /><br /><span class="word">court</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">facing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">north.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6828.htm">Strong's 6828: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hidden, dark, the north as a, quarter</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 40:20 The gate of the outer court whose (Ezek.
