The "people of the East" likely refers to nomadic tribes such as the Babylonians or other groups from the Arabian Desert. Historically, these eastern peoples were known for their invasions and conquests. The use of "possession" suggests a complete transfer of control and ownership, emphasizing the totality of the judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you.</b><br>This imagery of setting up camps and pitching tents signifies a prolonged occupation. It suggests that the invaders will not merely pass through but will establish a presence, indicating a significant and lasting impact on the land and its people. In the ancient Near Eastern context, this would mean a disruption of the local culture and economy. The nomadic lifestyle of the invaders contrasts with the settled life of the Ammonites, highlighting the severity of the judgment.<p><b>They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.</b><br>This phrase underscores the complete takeover of the Ammonites' resources. "Fruit" and "milk" symbolize the sustenance and prosperity of the land, which will now benefit the invaders. This reflects the covenant curses found in Deuteronomy, where disobedience leads to foreign nations consuming the produce of the land. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as the Ammonites had rejoiced over the fall of Jerusalem, showing hostility towards God's people. This consumption of resources can be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment and restoration themes found in the New Testament, where Christ's return will bring justice and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

Because the Lord&#8217;s judgments are always righteous and true (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>), the sentence is certain. The &#8220;people of the East&#8221; were nomadic desert tribes&#8212;Midianites, Ishmaelites, and other Bedouin peoples. In Scripture these tribes often appear as God&#8217;s tool of discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28-29</a>; <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3-6</a>). What looks like a geopolitical shift is actually the outworking of divine sovereignty. Notice:<p>&#8226; The LORD owns the land and its destiny (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; When He gives territory to others, it is not theft but judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This warning reminds every nation that security rests in honoring God, not in borders or alliances (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you</b><p>The arriving nomads would not merely raid Ammon; they would settle there. Tents signal a long-term occupation, displacing the Ammonites from their own soil. Similar imagery appears when Midian &#8220;camped in the land and laid waste the crops&#8221; of Israel (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). Key implications:<p>&#8226; Continuous presence means continual loss&#8212;Ammon&#8217;s culture and autonomy erode day by day.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word leaves no middle ground: either be a covenant partner or become a cautionary tale (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates later prophecies where foreign armies live off conquered territory (<a href="/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Jeremiah 35:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will eat your fruit and drink your milk</b><p>The invaders would consume the produce and livestock Ammon once enjoyed. This fulfills covenant-style judgments in which outsiders &#8220;consume the harvest of your land and the toil of your labor&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>). Points to note:<p>&#8226; Loss of fruit signifies economic collapse; loss of milk speaks to life&#8217;s daily sustenance (<a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; What Ammon stole from Israel through ridicule and hostility (<a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6-7</a>) is now stripped from Ammon.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is measured: the punishment mirrors the offense, underscoring His perfect fairness (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a> declares a three-fold judgment on Ammon: transfer of ownership to desert tribes, their physical occupation of Ammonite land, and the total consumption of Ammon&#8217;s resources. Each detail reveals God&#8217;s absolute authority over nations, His faithful execution of justice, and the certainty that mocking His people ultimately invites personal ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">To the men of the east.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">sons of the east, i.e., </span>the various nomadic tribes inhabiting the Eastern deserts, who occupy the country to this day.

(See <a href="/ezekiel/21-28.htm" title="And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say you, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:">Ezekiel 21:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Palaces.</span>--The word properly means an enclosure for folding cattle.

It afterwards came to mean a dwelling-place of any kind. The Ammonites and Moabites appear to have practically constituted one nation, the latter being, for the most part, the settled, and the former the nomadic portion. After the conquest of Nebuchadnezzar the Ammonites gradually dwindled away, until lost from history. The Ptolemies founded the city Philadelphia on the site of Rabbah, and there are still extensive ruins there belonging to the period of the Roman occupation; but the Ammonites had no part in either of these successive cities. The place is now utterly without inhabitants, and the most recent traveller says, "Lonely desolation in a rich country was the striking characteristic."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of the east</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">children of the east</span>.

This was, probably, the immediate result of Nebuchadnezzar's march. Rabbah was left undefended, and became <span class="cmt_word">a stable for the camels</span> of the Midianites and other tribes (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>). The prediction has been slowly fulfilled. Under the Greece-Egyptian rule the city revived, was named after Ptolemy Philadel-phus, and was flourishing under the Roman Empire. Remains of temples, theatres, houses, are still found on its site, but its present desolate condition agrees with the picture drawn here by Ezekiel and in <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>. The language of <a href="/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a> implies captivity and a partial return from it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1441;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will indeed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
