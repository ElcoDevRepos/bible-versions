In the context of Ezekiel, this purification is part of the vision of the new temple, which symbolizes the restoration of Israel and the reestablishment of proper worship. The purification process is essential for maintaining holiness and is reminiscent of the Levitical laws found in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where purification was necessary for the Day of Atonement. This reflects the importance of purity before approaching God, emphasizing His holiness and the need for atonement.<p><b>you are to present a young, unblemished bull</b><br>The presentation of a young, unblemished bull signifies a sin offering, which was a common practice in the Old Testament to atone for sins and seek reconciliation with God. The requirement for the bull to be "unblemished" underscores the need for perfection in offerings, symbolizing the purity and holiness required by God. This can be connected to the sacrificial system outlined in <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, where a bull was used for the sin offering of the anointed priest, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for a perfect sacrifice.<p><b>and an unblemished ram from the flock</b><br>The inclusion of an unblemished ram complements the offering of the bull, often associated with consecration and dedication. In <a href="/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22</a>, a ram is used in the ordination of priests, symbolizing their dedication to God's service. The requirement for the ram to be unblemished again emphasizes the need for purity and perfection in offerings. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God, unblemished and perfect, offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The dual offering of both a bull and a ram highlights the comprehensive nature of atonement and dedication in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The &#8220;purification&#8221; points back to the sin-offering rites in <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29-15.htm">2 Chronicles 29:15-16</a>, where priests cleanse altar and people before any ongoing ministry can happen.<p>&#8226; Purification ends only when God&#8217;s requirements are fully met; nothing partial satisfies His holiness (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; For us today, the finished work of Christ fulfills every purification shadow (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>). Yet the principle remains: approach God only through completed, God-given cleansing, never by self-effort (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to present</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Present&#8221; carries the idea of deliberate, willing offering (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). It is not enough for cleansing to be done; worshipers actively bring what God asks (<a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The action is priest-led, showing that access to God is mediated. In our era, Jesus is the High Priest who brings us near (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The forward-looking temple vision underscores that in every age God sets the terms of worship, and obedience is the proper response (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a young, unblemished bull</b><p>&#8226; A bull signifies strength and costliness (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>).

While pointing to a literal millennial ceremony, the verse simultaneously directs present-day believers to rejoice that Jesus has fulfilled every requirement and invites us to offer our cleansed lives to God in wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Hast made an end of cleansing it.</span>--Not an end of the entire service of consecration, but of the sin offering for the day, for <a href="/ezekiel/43-25.htm" title="Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.">Ezekiel 43:25</a> says distinctly that both a sin offering and a burnt offering were to be offered on each day of the seven. The reason that the burnt offering is not mentioned on the first day is, that the sin offering being changed on the second day, the prophet first describes that for both days, and then goes to the other, which remained the same throughout. Here the burnt offering is a bullock and a ram; in Exodus 29 two rams.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - The presentation of <span class="cmt_word">a burnt offering unto the Lord</span> was the next item in the ritual that should be observed. The material composing it should consist of <span class="cmt_word">a young bullock without blemish</span>, as in the ordinary sacrificial cede (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3, 4, 5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and a ram out of the flock without blemish</span>, as in the consecration of the priests (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>) and of the altar (<a href="/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18</a>). The persons presenting it should be the prophet, <span class="cmt_word">thou</span>, and the priests, <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, as his representatives. The mode of offering should be by burning, the distinctive act in a burnt offering, as that of a sin offering was sprinkling, and that of a peace offering the sacrificial meal, and by casting <span class="cmt_word">salt</span> upon the carcass, a feature in every meat offering (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), and here added probably to intensify the idea of purification. "In the corrosive and antiseptic property of salt there is hidden something of the purifying and consuming nature of fire; hence the Redeemer, in <a href="/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>, combines the salting of the sacrifice with the purifying fire of self- denial" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 145). The significance of it should be an expression of complete self-surrender unto Jehovah, as the necessary outcome of the antecedent act of expiation. The time of its presentation should be immediately after the cleansing of the altar on the second day, and presumably also on the succeeding days. Whether the burnt offering was, as Keil maintains, or was not, as Kliefoth contends, offered also on the first day is difficult to decide, though the former opinion has, perhaps, most in its favor. The Mosaic ritual always enjoined a burnt offering to be offered as a sequel to the sin offering (comp. <a href="/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14, 18</a>, with <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14, 18</a>; and see Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 86); and, in accordance with this, vers. 23 and 24 naturally follow on vers. 19-21, ver. 22 being interposed because of the variation in the sin offering for the second day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When you have finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
