This mirrors the precision seen in the construction of Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 6) and the tabernacle (Exodus 25-27). The gate chambers served as guardrooms, indicating the importance of security and order in the temple. The side pillars symbolize strength and stability, often representing God's enduring presence. The portico, or porch, is a transitional space, signifying the movement from the secular to the sacred, reminiscent of the portico in Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>).<p><b>It also had windows all around.</b><br>The presence of windows suggests openness and the allowance of light, symbolizing divine revelation and truth. In ancient architecture, windows were often placed high to provide light while maintaining security. This design can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment, where God's light penetrates the hearts of believers. The windows in the temple may also reflect the vision of the New Jerusalem, where God's glory illuminates the city (<a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>).<p><b>It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</b><br>The dimensions of the temple structure emphasize symmetry and order, reflecting God's nature as a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The use of cubits, an ancient measurement, ties the vision to historical Israelite practices, grounding the prophecy in a tangible reality. The specific dimensions may also have symbolic significance, with the number fifty often associated with jubilee and freedom (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), and twenty-five representing grace upon grace.

Every outer gate he measures includes three guardrooms or gate chambers (40:7); the north gate in v. 36 follows that same pattern.<p>&#8226; These rooms picture ordered access&#8212;entry is controlled, holy, and purposeful (cf. 44:1&#8211;3; <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).
