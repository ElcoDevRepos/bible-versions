In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this imagery conveys the overwhelming presence and power of God. The height of the rims may symbolize the transcendence and sovereignty of God, who is above all creation. The term "awesome" reflects the fear and reverence that God's presence inspires. This aligns with other biblical passages that describe God's majesty, such as <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>, where the prophet Isaiah sees the Lord seated on a high and exalted throne.<p><b>and all four rims were full of eyes all around</b><br>The eyes on the rims symbolize divine omniscience and vigilance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, eyes often represented knowledge and awareness. The presence of eyes all around the rims indicates that nothing escapes God's notice; He sees all and knows all. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, where the four living creatures around God's throne are also covered with eyes, emphasizing their role in witnessing and proclaiming God's holiness. The eyes may also suggest the idea of God's providence and care, as He watches over His creation with perfect insight and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Just as Isaiah saw the Lord &#8220;high and lifted up&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), these immense rims announce that nothing in creation rivals God&#8217;s throne-chariot.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Awesome&#8221; translates the sense of holy dread that comes when finite creatures meet infinite majesty (<a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the wheels move in perfect harmony with the living creatures (<a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19-20</a>; 10:9), their height also hints at unstoppable mobility. God&#8217;s sovereign presence is never confined or hindered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all four rims were full of eyes all around</b><p>&#8226; Eyes in Scripture picture perception and vigilance. These eyes blanket every rim, indicating total, unblinking awareness (<a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene parallels <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, where the living creatures around God&#8217;s throne are likewise &#8220;full of eyes,&#8221; stressing His omniscience that surveys both heaven and earth (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Fourfold symmetry matches the four directions (north, south, east, west). God&#8217;s watchful care is comprehensive; no corner of creation escapes His gaze (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2-3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Taken literally, Ezekiel sees an actual wheel-work outfitted with countless eyes. Spiritually, the vision reassures exiles&#8212;then and now&#8212;that the Lord sees every injustice, every heartache, and will act in His perfect timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a> shows towering, awe-inspiring rims filled with eyes to proclaim two inseparable truths: God&#8217;s sovereign power can go anywhere, and His omniscient gaze misses nothing. The Lord who rides on such wheels is both mighty to move and fully aware, giving His people confidence that He governs every place and every moment with flawless wisdom and holy authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Their rings.</span>--The same word is used twice in this verse, and means what we call the <span class= "ital">felloes. </span>"They were both high and terrible," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>they had both these characteristics, but not, as seems to be implied in our translation, that one was the cause of the other. The height might be inferred from the fact that the wheel was "upon the earth," and yet was "by the living creatures" (<a href="/ezekiel/1-15.htm" title="Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel on the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.">Ezekiel 1:15</a>) who were seen in the cloud (<a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm" title="Also out of the middle thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.">Ezekiel 1:5</a>). The terribleness was in keeping with all other parts of the vision, and its reason is explained in the circumstances which follow.<p><span class= "bld">Full of eyes.</span>--In <a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a> it is said of the living creatures, "their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about." It was the same vision in either case (<a href="/context/ezekiel/10-20.htm" title="This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:20-22</a>), only in the effort to describe it, which the prophet evidently feels it impossible to do adequately, he mentions now one particular and now another. In the corresponding vision in the Apocalypse the four living creatures are represented as "full of eyes within" (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>). In both places alike the symbolism sets forth God's perfect knowledge of all His works: here as showing the absolute wisdom of all His doings (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm" title="For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly: therefore from now on you shall have wars.">2Chronicles 16:9</a>), there as resulting in perfect and harmonious praise from all His works. The Hebrew seers ever looked through all secondary causes directly to the ultimate force which originates and controls all nature, and which they represent as intelligent and self-conscious. To do this the more effectively, they often use in their visions such concrete imagery as this before us. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for their rings,</span> etc. The "rings" or "felloes" of the wheels impressed the prophet's mind with a sense of awe, partly from their size, partly from their being "full of eyes." These were obviously, as again in <a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>, and in the analogues of the "stone with seven eyes" in <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, and the "four beasts [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'living creatures'] full of eyes," in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, symbols of the omniscience of God working through the forces of nature and of history.
