Tubal and Meshech are typically associated with regions in Asia Minor, possibly modern-day Turkey. These names are also mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a> as descendants of Japheth, indicating their role in the spread of nations after the flood. The mention of these groups highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre, a powerful Phoenician city known for its commerce and wealth. This network extended across the Mediterranean and into Asia, showcasing Tyre's influence and the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations.<p><b>They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your merchandise.</b><br>The trade of slaves was a common practice in the ancient world, and Tyre was a central hub for such exchanges. This reflects the harsh realities of ancient economies where human lives were often commodified. The mention of bronze utensils indicates the value placed on metalwork, which was a significant aspect of trade during this period. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was used for various tools, weapons, and decorative items, signifying technological advancement and the demand for durable goods.
