The inner sanctuary, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where God's presence dwelt. This mirrors the inner sanctum of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16-20</a>) and the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>). It symbolizes the ultimate communion with God, foreshadowing the access believers have through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>and measured the side pillars at the entrance to be two cubits wide</b><br>The measurement of the side pillars emphasizes precision and order in God's design. A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making these pillars about three feet wide. Pillars often symbolize strength and stability (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>), and their presence at the entrance signifies the support and foundation of God's dwelling place. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the cornerstone and foundation of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><b>The entrance was six cubits wide</b><br>The entrance's width, about nine feet, indicates accessibility and openness, yet it is still a controlled entry, signifying that access to God's presence is both available and restricted to those who are sanctified. This reflects the narrow gate Jesus speaks of in <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>, where entry into the Kingdom requires commitment and righteousness.<p><b>and the walls on each side were seven cubits wide</b><br>The walls, measuring about ten and a half feet wide, provide a sense of security and separation from the outside world. The number seven often represents completeness and perfection in the Bible, suggesting the perfect protection and holiness of God's presence. This can be connected to the protective nature of God's covenant with His people, as seen throughout scripture (<a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future idealized temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_measuring.htm">The Measuring</a></b><br>The act of measuring the temple signifies God's order, precision, and the importance of His dwelling place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_order.htm">God's Holiness and Order</a></b><br>The precise measurements of the temple highlight God's holiness and the order He brings to His creation.

This physical movement stresses God&#8217;s intention to dwell among His covenant people again in a concrete, visible way. <a href="/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3&#8211;5</a> reminds us that the inner sanctuary historically housed the ark and the mercy seat&#8212;symbols of atonement and divine presence. In the millennial temple Ezekiel describes, the literal return of God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4&#8211;5</a>) is anticipated, assuring Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;of His steadfast promise to live with His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And measured the side pillars at the entrance to be two cubits wide</b><p>The angel&#8217;s precise measurement&#8212;about three feet for each pillar&#8212;signals both stability and intentional design. Earlier temples featured prominent pillars: Jachin and Boaz in Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15&#8211;21</a>). Those pillars spoke of establishment and strength; these future pillars echo the same message. Jesus promises the overcomer, &#8220;I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>), linking faithful believers with the steadfast support structures of God&#8217;s dwelling. Every detail, even the width of a pillar, underlines God&#8217;s orderly plan and unshakable kingdom (<a href="/psalms/118-20.htm">Psalm 118:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The entrance was six cubits wide</b><p>A doorway roughly ten feet across creates a broad, welcoming access point. Six cubits exceeds earlier temple entrances (compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>), suggesting increased openness in the age to come. Jesus declares, &#8220;I am the gate; whoever enters through Me will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). The generous width echoes that invitation&#8212;there is room for all who come by faith. Yet the measurement also preserves order; access is through one clearly defined doorway, not a gap in the wall (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the walls on each side were seven cubits wide</b><p>Walls nearly twelve feet thick convey security and permanence. Seven often denotes completion or perfection in Scripture; these walls picture God&#8217;s complete protection around His sanctuary (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>). <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> promises, &#8220;I will be a wall of fire around her,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12&#8211;14</a> portrays massive walls guarding the New Jerusalem. In every era God ensures that His presence is safeguarded and His people are safe within.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a> is far more than an architectural note. Each measured element&#8212;the inner sanctuary, sturdy pillars, wide entrance, and perfect walls&#8212;shows our Lord&#8217;s commitment to dwell with His people in holiness, accessibility, stability, and protection. The literal precision of these dimensions confirms the reliability of God&#8217;s future plans and reassures us that His house, and our place in it, are eternally secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Went he inward.--</span>There is here a noticeable change in the usual expression; in all other cases the angel had brought the prophet to the places to be measured, but as he is here entering the Holy of Holies, into which, under the law, Ezekiel might not enter, the angel goes in alone. The prophetic vision was not yet sufficiently clear to speak of the way into the true Holy of Holies as at length opened to all (<a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The door, six cubits.--</span><span class= "ital">Door</span> is here used for <span class= "ital">doorway,</span> the clear space between the posts.

As this could not be entered even by a priest, but only by the high priest once a year (<a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>), Ezekiel was left without, while "the man" announced to him in succession the measurements of the <span class="accented">adytum</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> these were taken. First, that of <span class="cmt_word">the post of the door</span> (the singular for the plural, meaning the post on either side of the doorway) <span class="cmt_word">two cubits</span>. Next, that of the door itself, which is given first as <span class="cmt_word">six</span> and second as <span class="cmt_word">seven cubits</span>. Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards "six" as the distance from "pest" to "post," and "seven" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, "the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
