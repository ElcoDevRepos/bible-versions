The outer wall served as a boundary and a protective barrier for the sacred spaces within. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, walls were significant for security and demarcation of holy areas. The chambers mentioned are likely the priestly chambers used for various temple functions, emphasizing the separation between the holy and the common.<p><b>was fifty cubits long</b><br>The measurement of fifty cubits indicates a specific and intentional design, reflecting the precision and orderliness of God's instructions for the temple. A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making this wall about 75 feet long. This detail underscores the importance of following divine specifications, reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the Tabernacle in Exodus.<p><b>and ran parallel to the chambers</b><br>The parallel alignment of the wall with the chambers suggests a structured and harmonious layout, which is a recurring theme in biblical descriptions of sacred spaces. This alignment may symbolize the order and symmetry of God's creation and His plans. It also highlights the importance of organization in worship and service to God.<p><b>and the outer court</b><br>The outer court was a significant area in the temple complex, accessible to the people for worship and sacrifices. It represents the place where the community could come near to God, though not entering the most sacred spaces reserved for the priests. This setup reflects the holiness of God and the need for mediation, pointing forward to the ultimate mediation through Jesus Christ, who provides access to God for all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

includes a literal boundary: &#8220;And He measured the wall all around&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>).<p>- Walls define holiness, separating what is sacred from common space, just as the court of the tabernacle did in <a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9-18</a>.<p>- <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a> pictures a similar outer area, showing God&#8217;s consistent pattern of marking off holy ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in front of the chambers</b><p>- The wall stands &#8220;in front of the chambers,&#8221; signaling protection and privacy for rooms reserved for priests (compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 46</a>:19).<p>- These chambers stored holy offerings and vestments (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>), echoing the priestly rooms in <a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5-9</a> that guarded temple resources.<p>- By placing the wall before the chambers, God ensures sacred service remains undisturbed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was fifty cubits long</b><p>- A cubit (about 18 in/45 cm) makes this length roughly 75 ft/23 m&#8212;an exact, literal measurement.<p>- Precise dimensions fill <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>; every number underscores God&#8217;s order (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>- Fifty cubits matches other temple features (<a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>), showing harmonious design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ran parallel to the chambers</b><p>- The wall runs &#8220;parallel,&#8221; creating a straight, dependable line&#8212;no randomness in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>).<p>- Parallel construction allows efficient movement for priests, comparable to the side rooms skirting Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-8</a>).<p>- The symmetry mirrors spiritual balance: God&#8217;s holiness alongside His people&#8217;s service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the outer court</b><p>- This wall also parallels &#8220;the outer court,&#8221; the place where worshipers gathered (<a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 46</a>:21-24).<p>- Maintaining a clear, physical separation keeps reverence intact, much like the veil once divided the holy place (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>).<p>- The layout signals that fellowship with God is open yet ordered; approach is invited, but irreverence is barred (<a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a> sketches a literal 75-foot wall shielding priestly

Its length is also said to be fifty cubits (the breadth of the chamber). It must, therefore, have been a screen wall at one end of the chambers, and it could not have been at the western end, as that was otherwise occupied (<a href="/context/ezekiel/46-19.htm" title="After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.">Ezekiel 46:19-20</a>).

The word here translated <span class= "ital">over against</span> is not the one used in <a href="/ezekiel/42-1.htm" title="Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm" title="Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.">Ezekiel 42:3</a>, and may equally well be rendered <span class= "ital">parallel to.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wall</span>; or, <span class="accented">fence</span> - the Hebrew term being not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>, both of which signify the wall of a city or a building, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, as in ver. 10), which means a fence or hedge, as in <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a> - <span class="cmt_word">without, over against</span> - or, <span class="accented">by the side of</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the chambers, toward the outer court</span>, cannot have been a rampart along the north side of-the chambers, since this was a hundred cubits long, but must have been a wall upon the side of the chambers (east or west) fencing off the outer court from the passage which led down by the side of the chambers. That this fence was on the east side is rendered probable by the circumstance that the sacrificial kitchen lay upon the west (see <a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19, 20</a>), and by the statements which follow in vers. 8 and 9. The fence was doubtless intended to screen the side windows of the lower chambers from public gaze, since these were to be occupied as robing and disrobing rooms for the priests who should officiate in the temple (see ver. 14;
