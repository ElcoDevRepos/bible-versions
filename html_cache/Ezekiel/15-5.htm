In ancient Israel, the vine was a common symbol for the nation (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). Unlike other trees, the wood of a vine is not suitable for construction or crafting; its primary purpose is to bear fruit. This imagery highlights the spiritual barrenness of Israel, as they failed to fulfill their covenantal role to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The vine's inability to be useful when whole underscores the idea that Israel, even at its best, was not fulfilling its intended purpose.<p><b>How much less can it ever be useful when the fire has consumed it and charred it!</b><br>The fire represents God's judgment, which had already begun to fall upon Jerusalem due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/ezekiel/14-12.htm">Ezekiel 14:12-23</a>). The charring of the vine signifies the destruction and devastation that comes as a result of this judgment. In the context of Ezekiel's prophecies, this serves as a warning of the impending Babylonian exile. The rhetorical question emphasizes the hopelessness of the situation; if the vine was useless before, it is even more so after being burned. This can be seen as a call to repentance, urging the people to recognize their spiritual state and turn back to God. The imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that will come through Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>), offering redemption and restoration to those who abide in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Represented metaphorically as a vine in this passage, Israel is being judged for its unfaithfulness and lack of fruitfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites were taken captive due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_fruitfulness.htm">The Importance of Fruitfulness</a></b><br>Just as a vine is expected to produce fruit, believers are called to bear spiritual fruit.

Unlike cedar or oak, vine wood is too soft and twisted for beams, pegs, or carved objects (<a href="/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2-4</a>).<p>&#8211; The only value of a vine is its fruit. When fruit is missing, the bare wood offers nothing of real service. The Lord had planted Israel to bear covenant fruit&#8212;justice, righteousness, devotion (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>)&#8212;but they produced only &#8220;wild grapes.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Jesus later echoes the same truth: &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>). Branches that do not abide in Him wither and are gathered for the fire.<p>&#8211; Practical take-away: religious heritage alone never substitutes for living obedience. A life that looks whole yet bears no spiritual fruit remains useless for God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How much less can it ever be useful when the fire has consumed it and charred it!</b><p>&#8211; Vine wood is already unsuitable; once scorched, it is good for nothing but more fire. God applies this image to Jerusalem, soon to be &#8220;delivered up to the fire&#8221; of Babylonian judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/15-6.htm">Ezekiel 15:6-8</a>).<p>&#8211; Previous disciplines had singed the nation, but instead of softening hearts, they hardened them. Charred wood cannot be reshaped; likewise, persistent rebellion leaves a person or a people beyond further usefulness until full judgment has done its work (<a href="/hebrews/6-7.htm">Hebrews 6:7-8</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>).<p>&#8211; For believers, the picture warns against making peace with sin after initial chastening. If partial burning does not bring repentance, a more consuming judgment follows (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet even this severe image carries hope: God burns the wood, not the vineyard itself. After exile, He would replant and renew (<a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>; <a href="/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-24</a>). The fire refines what will one day flourish again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a> teaches that vine wood, valuable only for fruit, is useless for construction; once charred, it is fit only for more flames. God uses the metaphor to expose fruitless Israel and to warn all who claim His name without obedience. A whole vine without fruit is already worthless; a burned vine, still fruitless, faces total destruction. The passage calls us to bear genuine, abiding fruit in Christ now, before discipline intensifies, trusting that God&#8217;s purpose&#8212;even in fiery judgment&#8212;is ultimately to restore a people who will finally glorify Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when it was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(bih&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
