Sheba is often associated with the Sabaeans, a people from the southern Arabian Peninsula, known for their trade in incense and spices. Raamah is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a> as a descendant of Cush, indicating a connection to the regions around the Arabian Peninsula. The mention of these merchants highlights the extensive trade networks of Tyre, a powerful city-state known for its commerce and influence. This phrase underscores the prosperity and far-reaching connections of Tyre, which is a central theme in Ezekiel's lamentation over the city.<p><b>for your wares they exchanged gold,</b><br>Gold was a highly valued commodity in the ancient world, often symbolizing wealth and power. The exchange of gold for Tyre's wares indicates the high value placed on the goods produced or traded by Tyre. This reflects the city's economic strength and the desirability of its products. In biblical terms, gold often represents purity and divine glory, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>).<p><b>the finest of all spices,</b><br>Spices were luxury items in the ancient world, used for cooking, medicine, and religious rituals. The reference to "the finest of all spices" suggests the high quality and desirability of the goods traded with Tyre. Spices like frankincense and myrrh were particularly valuable and often associated with wealth and status. In the New Testament, spices are notably mentioned in the context of Jesus' burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39-40</a>), symbolizing honor and reverence.<p><b>and precious stones.</b><br>Precious stones were another symbol of wealth and beauty in the ancient world. They were used in jewelry, religious artifacts, and as symbols of status. The inclusion of precious stones in the trade with Tyre further emphasizes the city's wealth and the high value of its trade goods. In biblical symbolism, precious stones are often associated with the divine, as seen in the description of the New Jerusalem in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>, where the city is adorned with various precious stones, representing the glory and beauty of God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba.htm">Sheba</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom, often associated with wealth and trade, located in the region of modern-day Yemen. Known for its spices and precious goods, Sheba is frequently mentioned in the Bible as a symbol of prosperity and commerce.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/raamah.htm">Raamah</a></b><br>A region or tribe mentioned in the Bible, likely located in the Arabian Peninsula. Raamah was known for its trading activities, particularly in luxury goods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/merchants.htm">Merchants</a></b><br>Traders who engaged in commerce with Tyre, the city being addressed in this chapter. These merchants were instrumental in the exchange of goods and wealth, contributing to Tyre's prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A prominent ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade. In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, Tyre is depicted as a powerful maritime trading hub, engaging with various nations and regions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trade_goods.htm">Trade Goods</a></b><br>The passage mentions spices, precious stones, and gold, highlighting the luxurious and valuable nature of the goods exchanged. These items symbolize wealth and the extensive trade networks of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_wealth.htm">The Transience of Earthly Wealth</a></b><br>The passage highlights the wealth and prosperity of Tyre through its trade with Sheba and Raamah. However, it serves as a reminder that earthly riches are temporary and can lead to pride and downfall, as seen in Tyre's eventual destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_righteous_trade.htm">The Importance of Righteous Trade</a></b><br>Engaging in commerce and trade is not inherently wrong, but it should be conducted with integrity and fairness. Christians are called to be honest in their dealings, reflecting God's righteousness in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The extensive trade networks and wealth of Tyre demonstrate the interconnectedness of nations. Yet, God is sovereign over all, and He can raise or bring down nations according to His will. Believers should trust in God's ultimate control over world affairs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_allure_of_materialism.htm">The Allure of Materialism</a></b><br>The luxurious goods mentioned in the passage can tempt individuals to prioritize material wealth over spiritual riches.

Their merchants were not mythical figures but real, wealthy traders who traveled long desert routes to seaports such as Tyre. <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a> later pictures these same peoples bringing gifts to Zion, confirming their historic role in commerce.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>traded with you</b><p>&#8220;You&#8221; is Tyre, the Phoenician city-state described in the larger oracle of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>. Tyre&#8217;s harbors drew merchants from every direction (compare <a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3, 25</a>).

The city&#8217;s ships acted like ancient shipping containers, accepting exotic products and redistributing them throughout the region.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they exchanged gold</b><p>Arabian mines and panning streams produced significant quantities of gold (<a href="/job/28-1.htm">Job 28:1&#8211;2</a>). When Queen Sheba visited Solomon she brought &#8220;120 talents of gold&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). That same commodity now flows to Tyre, proving the literal prosperity of these kingdoms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the finest of all spices</b><p>Frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon were harvested on the Arabian peninsula (Song of Songs 4:14; <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23&#8211;24</a>). <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a> shows these spices retained value even a millennium later.
