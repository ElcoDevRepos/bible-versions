The "seed of the land" signifies the potential for growth and continuation of the line of David, which is a central theme in the Old Testament. This act of taking the seed can be seen as a strategic move to ensure control over the land by influencing its leadership.<p><b>and planted it in fertile soil;</b><br>The fertile soil symbolizes a place with potential for growth and prosperity. In the context of the Babylonian exile, this can be interpreted as the relocation of the Judean leadership to Babylon, where they were given opportunities to thrive under Babylonian rule. Fertile soil also alludes to God's providence and the potential for spiritual growth even in foreign lands, as seen in the stories of Daniel and his companions.<p><b>he placed it by abundant waters</b><br>Abundant waters indicate a source of life and sustenance, essential for growth. This imagery is often used in Scripture to describe prosperity and blessing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). In the context of Ezekiel, it suggests that the exiles in Babylon were given resources and conditions to flourish, despite being away from their homeland. This can also be seen as a metaphor for God's provision and care for His people, even in exile.<p><b>and set it out like a willow.</b><br>The willow is a tree known for its ability to thrive near water, symbolizing resilience and adaptability. This imagery suggests that the people of Judah, though displaced, were expected to adapt and grow in their new environment. The willow's ability to bend without breaking can be seen as a metaphor for the endurance and faithfulness required of the exiles. This resilience is echoed in the broader biblical narrative, where God's people are often called to remain faithful amidst trials, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who embodies perfect faithfulness and resilience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who conveyed messages through visions and parables, often using symbolic language to communicate God's will to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eagle.htm">The Eagle</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a>, the eagle represents the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who exerts influence over Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the people of Judah, particularly the royal offspring or leadership, who are taken and planted in a new environment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fertile_soil.htm">Fertile Soil</a></b><br>Represents the conditions provided by Babylon, where the exiled people of Judah are expected to grow and thrive.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abundant_waters.htm">Abundant Waters</a></b><br>Symbolizes the resources and opportunities available in Babylon, suggesting potential for growth and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_exile.htm">God's Sovereignty in Exile</a></b><br>Even in exile, God has a plan for His people.

When Zedekiah broke covenant and sought help from Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>), the willow was uprooted.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>&#8217;s promise that Israel&#8217;s offspring &#8220;will sprout among the grass like willows by flowing streams&#8221; shows God&#8217;s heart: He desires His people to thrive through humble dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5</a> paints God&#8217;s sovereign placement of Judah&#8217;s remaining monarchy. A native king (the &#8220;seed&#8221;) was carefully positioned in ideal conditions&#8212;fertile soil, abundant water, the pliant strength of a willow. Everything necessary for growth and stability was provided. Yet prosperity required loyalty to the covenant and submission to God-ordained authority. The verse reminds us that divine opportunity does not guarantee blessing; faithfulness determines whether planted seed becomes a flourishing tree or a withered stump.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Of the seed of the land.</span>--In place of the captive Jehoiachin Nebuchadnezzar did not set over the land an eastern satrap, but appointed a native prince, Zedekiah, the uncle of Jehoiachin. He was "planted," not like the tall cedar on the mountain, but yet like "a willow tree by great waters" where it might flourish in its degree (see <a href="/ezekiel/17-14.htm" title="That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.">Ezekiel 17:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed of the land</span> is Zedekiah, who was made king by Nebuchadnezzar in Jeconiah's place. The imagery of the <span class="cmt_word">willow</span> (the Hebrew word occurs here only) seems suggested by Ezekiel's surroundings. No tree could stand out in greater contrast to the cedar of Lebanon than the willows which he saw growing by the waters of Babylon (<a href="/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>, though the word is different). The choice of the willow determined the rest of the imagery, and the <span class="cmt_word">fruitful field</span> and the great or "many" (Revised Version) waters represent Judah, possibly with reference to its being in its measure a "land of brooks of waters," of "fountains and depths," of "wheat and barley and wine" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-12</a>). The kingdom of Zedekiah, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, was left with sufficient elements for material prosperity. That prosperity is indicated in ver. 6 by the fact that the willow became a vine. It was of "low stature," indeed, trailing on the ground. It could not claim the greatness of an independent kingdom. Its branches turned toward the planter (ver. 6); its roots were under him. It acknowledged, that is, Nebuchadnezzar's suzerainty, and so, had things continued as they were, it might have prospered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
