In the context of Ezekiel's visions, this man often represents divine guidance and instruction. The presence of such a figure is consistent with other prophetic visions in the Bible, such as those experienced by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15-16</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>). This guide helps Ezekiel understand the visions and messages he receives, emphasizing the importance of divine interpretation in understanding God's revelations.<p><b>I heard someone speaking to me</b><br>Hearing a voice in prophetic visions is a common biblical motif, signifying direct communication from God. This auditory experience underscores the authority and authenticity of the message being delivered. In the context of Ezekiel, it highlights the prophet's role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. Similar instances occur in the call of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4-10</a>) and the conversion of Saul (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4-6</a>), where hearing God's voice marks a pivotal moment in their spiritual journeys.<p><b>from inside the temple</b><br>The temple is a central theme in Ezekiel's prophecy, symbolizing God's presence among His people. In this vision, the voice coming from inside the temple signifies the restoration of God's dwelling place with Israel, a key aspect of Ezekiel's message of hope and renewal. The temple's significance is rooted in its role as the spiritual and cultural heart of Israel, as seen in Solomon's dedication of the first temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This vision also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and the future establishment of the New Jerusalem, where God will dwell with His people eternally (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with conveying them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Often interpreted as an angelic figure or a divine messenger, this man guides Ezekiel through the vision of the new temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice_from_the_temple.htm">The Voice from the Temple</a></b><br>Represents God's presence and authority, speaking directly to Ezekiel from within the temple, signifying divine communication and instruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's dwelling place among His people, representing holiness, worship, and the restoration of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Part of a larger vision given to Ezekiel, detailing the future temple and the return of God's glory to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_holiness.htm">God's Presence and Holiness</a></b><br>God's voice from the temple underscores His desire to dwell among His people and the importance of holiness in His presence.

The verse affirms the certainty, clarity, and nearness of God&#8217;s promised presence in the coming millennial kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) I <span class= "bld">heard him speaking.--</span>Although the pronoun is not expressed in the original, there can be no question that God Himself spoke directly to the prophet, as in <a href="/ezekiel/44-2.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.">Ezekiel 44:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-5.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 44:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-9.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.">Ezekiel 44:9</a>, &c. "The man" is without the article in the Hebrew, which leaves it uncertain whether the same being is meant who had hitherto guided the prophet; but as measurements were also made by this guide (<a href="/context/ezekiel/47-3.htm" title="And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.">Ezekiel 47:3-5</a>), he was probably the same.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard him</span> (better, one) <span class="cmt_word">speaking unto me out of the house; and the</span> (literally, a) <span class="cmt_word">man stood by me</span>. Two questions arise - Who was the speaker? and, Who the man? As <span class="accented">to the speaker</span>, the natural reply is that the One who addressed Ezekiel from the interior of the "house" was Jehovah himself, whose "glory" had just entered in to take possession of the house, and this view is adopted by most interpreters, though Hengstenberg and Schroder regard the man who stood beside the prophet as the one who addressed him. As to <span class="accented">the man</span>, it cannot, as Kliefoth maintains, be decided solely by the absence of the article before "man" that this was a different person from the guide who had hitherto conducted the prophet and measured the Building. The article may have Been emitted because the important point to be recorded was not the circumstance that the "one" who stood beside him was his quondam guide, but the fact that this "one" was a man. That he was also Ezekiel's old conductor is at least a natural suggestion when one finds him afterwards appearing as a measurer with a line in his hand (<a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">standing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;m&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">beside me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1510;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7779;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_681.htm">Strong's 681: </a> </span><span class="str2">A joining together, proximity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1435;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">someone speaking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from inside the temple,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;hab&#183;b&#257;&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/43-6.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 43:6 I heard one speaking to me out (Ezek.
