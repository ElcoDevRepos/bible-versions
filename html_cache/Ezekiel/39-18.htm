The "mighty" refers to powerful warriors and leaders who oppose God's people. This imagery is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern practices where victors would often leave the bodies of the defeated unburied, a sign of utter defeat and disgrace. It also echoes the language of divine judgment found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, where the Lord's sword is filled with blood and fat from a great slaughter.<p><b>and drink the blood of the princes of the earth</b><br>The "princes of the earth" signifies the high-ranking officials and rulers who are part of the opposition against God. Drinking blood, in this context, is a metaphor for complete victory and the total consumption of the enemy's power and influence. This imagery is stark and serves to emphasize the totality of God's judgment. It also connects to the covenantal language found in <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, where blood is associated with life, highlighting the severity of the judgment.<p><b>as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls</b><br>These animals were commonly used in sacrificial offerings in the Old Testament, particularly in the Levitical system (Leviticus 1-7). The comparison suggests that the enemies of God will be offered up as sacrifices, indicating their complete destruction and the vindication of God's holiness. This sacrificial language underscores the idea that the judgment is not just a military victory but a divine act of worship and justice.<p><b>all the fattened animals of Bashan</b><br>Bashan was a region known for its fertile land and well-fed livestock (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). The reference to "fattened animals" implies abundance and richness, suggesting that the judgment will be thorough and complete. Bashan's reputation for strong and healthy animals serves as a metaphor for the strength and prosperity of the enemies, which will be utterly consumed. This imagery also connects to <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, where the "strong bulls of Bashan" surround the psalmist, symbolizing powerful adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
