The "villages on her mainland" indicates the surrounding settlements dependent on Tyre, which were vulnerable to attack. Historically, Tyre was divided into two parts: the mainland city and the island city. The mainland was more accessible to invaders, making it susceptible to conquest. The "sword" symbolizes warfare and divine judgment, often used in prophetic literature to denote God's instrument of punishment. This prophecy was fulfilled through various historical sieges, notably by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and later by Alexander the Great, who destroyed the mainland settlements.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the judgment: to reveal God's sovereignty and authority. Throughout the Old Testament, the recognition of God as LORD is a recurring theme, especially in the context of judgment and deliverance. The phrase "they will know that I am the LORD" is a common refrain in Ezekiel, emphasizing that God's actions, whether in judgment or blessing, are meant to lead people to acknowledge His supremacy. This acknowledgment is not just intellectual but relational, calling for a response of reverence and obedience. The fulfillment of this prophecy against Tyre serves as a testament to God's control over nations and history, reinforcing His identity as the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient and prosperous Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its wealth and strong maritime trade.

God singles out these dependent towns to show that His judgment will reach every corner of Tyre&#8217;s influence (<a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8-11</a>). Their inclusion mirrors earlier patterns&#8212;when Canaanite &#8220;villages and their surrounding settlements&#8221; fell with their parent cities (<a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29-30</a>). The phrase reminds us that sin&#8217;s consequences never stay isolated; influence brings accountability (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be slain by the sword</b><p>The sword in Ezekiel consistently represents literal warfare (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-4</a>; 29:8). Here it foretells Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s campaign (<a href="/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7-11</a>) and, later, Alexander&#8217;s total demolition of the mainland in 332 BC. The language is not metaphor but concrete: soldiers, siege ramps, and bloodshed. God often calls foreign armies &#8220;My sword&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6-7</a>). He wields them to judge unrepentant nations, proving that geopolitical events unfold under His direct governance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will know</b><p>Recognition follows judgment throughout the book (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>; 25:7; 30:19). People ignore God&#8217;s warnings until His actions break their defenses and illusions. When Tyre&#8217;s proud commerce turns to rubble, survivors and onlookers alike will grasp that the God of Israel alone ordains rise and ruin (<a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27-36</a>). Divine purpose is never simple vengeance; it is revelation&#8212;pressing truth on hearts hardened by prosperity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That I am the LORD</b><p>The covenant name Yahweh (translated &#8220;the LORD&#8221;) proclaims self-existence, sovereignty, and moral authority (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-7</a>). By attaching His name to this prophecy, God assures its certainty: if the coastal villages fall exactly as spoken, Israel&#8212;and the world&#8212;must acknowledge the Speaker. The collapse of Tyre becomes another milestone in the unfolding testimony that &#8220;the Most High rules the kingdoms of men&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). What He foretells, He performs; what He performs, He interprets.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/26-6.htm">Ezekiel 26:6</a> declares that Tyre&#8217;s mainland villages will literally fall by invading swords, demonstrating God&#8217;s control over nations.
