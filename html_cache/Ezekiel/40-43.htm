The use of hooks in sacrificial contexts is consistent with practices in ancient Near Eastern temples, where such tools were necessary for handling offerings. This detail underscores the meticulous nature of temple worship and the importance of order in the sacrificial system.<p><b>each a handbreadth long</b><br>A handbreadth is an ancient unit of measurement approximately equal to four inches or the width of a hand. This specific measurement highlights the precision and care in the construction and furnishing of the temple, reflecting the divine instructions given to Ezekiel.

This arrangement may symbolize the comprehensive nature of God's provision and the thoroughness required in worship practices. It also reflects the temple's role as a place of continual sacrifice and worship.<p><b>and the flesh of the offering</b><br>The mention of "flesh of the offering" refers to the sacrificial system central to Israelite worship, where offerings were made to atone for sin and express devotion to God. This practice is deeply rooted in the Mosaic Law, as seen in Leviticus, and points to the need for a mediator between God and humanity. It foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect atonement for sin.<p><b>was to be placed on the tables</b><br>The tables in the temple were used for preparing and presenting sacrifices. This detail emphasizes the structured and sacred nature of temple worship.

Our translators, following the ancient Chaldee paraphrast, have probably given the true sense, <span class= "ital">hooks,</span> upon which the flesh of the victims was hung after it had been prepared upon the tables.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hooks</span>.

As this sense is unsuitable, recourse must be had to its derivation (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, "to put, set, or fix"), which suggests as its import here either, as Ewald, Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Havernick, and Smend, following the LXX. and Vulgate, prefer, "ledges," or "border guards," on the edge of the tables, to keep the instruments or flesh from falling off; or, as Kimchi, Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre, after the Chaldean paraphrast, explain, "pegs" fastened in the wall for hanging the slaughtered caresses before they were flayed. In favor of the first meaning stand the facts that the second clause of this verse speaks of" tables," not of "walls," and that the measure of the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> is one of breadth rather than of length; against it are the considerations that the dual form, <span class="accented">shephataim</span>, fits better to a forked peg than to a double border, and that the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> are stated to have been fastened "in the house" (<span class="accented">ba-baith</span>), which again suits the idea of a peg fastened in the outer wall of the porch, rather than of a border fixed upon a table. The last clause of this verse is rendered by Ewald, after the LXX., "and over the tables" (obviously those standing outside of the porch) "were covers to protect them from rain and from drought;" and it is conceivable that coverings might have been advantageous for both the wooden tables and the officiating priests; only the Hebrew must be changed before it can yield this rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The double-pronged hooks,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;p&#772;at&#183;ta&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
