This architectural feature may symbolize the divine illumination and revelation that comes from God, as light often represents truth and understanding in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<br><br>Palm trees: Palm trees are frequently used in biblical imagery to symbolize victory, peace, and eternal life. They were a common decorative motif in ancient Near Eastern architecture, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>). The presence of palm trees in the temple's design may point to the victory and peace found in God's presence and the eternal life offered through Him.<br><br>Sidewalls of the portico: The portico, or porch, served as an entrance to the temple, a place of transition from the outside world into the sacred space. The sidewalls adorned with palm trees and windows suggest a welcoming yet holy threshold, emphasizing the importance of approaching God with reverence and awe.<p><b>The side rooms of the temple also had canopies.</b><br>Side rooms: These rooms likely served various functions, such as storage for temple implements or spaces for priests to prepare for their duties. The presence of side rooms indicates the practical and organized nature of temple worship, reflecting God's order and provision for His people.<br><br>Canopies: Canopies may refer to coverings or structures that provided shelter and protection. In a spiritual sense, they could symbolize God's covering and protection over His people. The imagery of a canopy is also reminiscent of the tabernacle, where God's presence dwelled among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple described in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> is a detailed blueprint of a future temple, symbolizing God's presence and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beveled_windows.htm">Beveled Windows</a></b><br>Architectural features that allow light into the temple, symbolizing illumination and divine presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palm_trees.htm">Palm Trees</a></b><br>Decorative elements symbolizing victory, peace, and eternal life, often associated with the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/portico.htm">Portico</a></b><br>The entrance or porch area of the temple, representing access to the sacred space.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The beveled windows symbolize the importance of allowing God's light to illuminate our lives.

The last word, translated "thick planks," is very obscure. If it be the plural of the word used in <a href="/ezekiel/41-25.htm" title="And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there were thick planks on the face of the porch without.">Ezekiel 41:25</a>, it would mean that the mouldings in front of the porches were also carved with palm trees.<p>It is to be observed that in these outer parts of the Temple only palm trees were used in the ornamentation, the cherubim being reserved for the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.<p>The description of the Temple proper is now finished, and it is noticeable how very little is said of its interior furniture and arrangements. There is no mention at all of that profuse overlaying with gold so characteristic of Solomon's Temple; nothing is said of the candlestick, or the table of show-bread; even the ark itself, that climax of Israel's symbolic worship, is not mentioned. The prophet seems to be looking forward to the time described by his contemporary, Jeremiah, when these outward symbols should be forgotten in the higher spiritual presence of the Lord: "They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD; neither shall it come to mind. . . . At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD, and all the nations shall be gathered unto it" (<a href="/context/jeremiah/3-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.">Jeremiah 3:16-17</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There were beveled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1496;&#1467;&#1502;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;u&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_331.htm">Strong's 331: </a> </span><span class="str2">To close, to contract</span><br /><br /><span class="word">windows</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
