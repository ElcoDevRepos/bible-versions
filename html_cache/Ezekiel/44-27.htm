The sanctuary, in the context of Ezekiel, is the holy place where God's presence dwells. The emphasis on "the day" highlights the importance of preparation and purification before entering such a holy place. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and the need for cleansing before approaching God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3-4</a>, where the high priest must undergo ritual purification before entering the Holy of Holies.<p><b>into the inner court</b><br>The inner court is a specific area within the temple complex, reserved for priests and those performing sacred duties. It is distinct from the outer court, which was accessible to the general Israelite population. The inner court's exclusivity underscores the separation between the holy and the common, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This separation is also seen in the design of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>), where different areas had varying levels of access based on holiness.<p><b>to minister in the sanctuary</b><br>Ministering in the sanctuary involves performing priestly duties such as offering sacrifices, burning incense, and maintaining the temple rituals. This service is a direct act of worship and obedience to God, reflecting the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people. The concept of ministering in the sanctuary is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8:1-2</a>, where Christ is described as a high priest who ministers in the true sanctuary in heaven.<p><b>he must present his sin offering</b><br>The requirement for a sin offering indicates the need for atonement and purification before serving in the temple. This offering acknowledges human sinfulness and the need for reconciliation with God. The sin offering is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>, where it is prescribed for unintentional sins, emphasizing the pervasive nature of sin and the necessity of atonement. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect sin offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase asserts the divine authority behind the command. The use of "declares the Lord GOD" emphasizes that these instructions are not merely ritualistic but are ordained by God Himself. It underscores the seriousness and sacredness of the priestly duties and the necessity of obedience to God's commands. This divine declaration is a common feature in prophetic literature, reinforcing the message's authenticity and authority, as seen throughout the book of Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The wording reminds us that approaching the Lord is never casual or random; it is scheduled, purposeful, and anticipated. Moses was told, &#8220;On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>), showing the same pattern of a set day for entering sacred space. Each appearance before God demands fresh readiness, echoing <a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19-20</a>, where Aaron and his sons had to wash &#8220;whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the inner court</b><p>The priest is not lingering in the temple&#8217;s public areas; he moves into the restricted inner court, the zone nearest the manifest presence of God. Ezekiel had earlier been led through successive gateways of this visionary temple (<a href="/ezekiel/40-28.htm">Ezekiel 40:28-31</a>), illustrating increasing holiness with each step inward. Only consecrated priests may cross this threshold, just as in Solomon&#8217;s temple only the priests approached &#8220;the inner sanctuary&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-33</a>). <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> asks, &#8220;Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?&#8221;&#8212;a sobering question every priest had to answer before stepping forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to minister in the sanctuary</b><p>Entering is not sightseeing; it is service. &#8220;At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). Ministry involves prayer, sacrifice, blessing, and representing the people. <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6</a> looks back on this rhythm: &#8220;The priests enter regularly into the first room to perform their sacred duties.&#8221; Ezekiel&#8217;s vision confirms that future priestly work remains centered on humble, obedient ministry before God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must present his sin offering</b><p>Even God&#8217;s servants cannot presume their own purity. Before a priest serves, he offers a sacrifice acknowledging personal guilt and seeking cleansing (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>; 9:7-8). The requirement underscores that sin is a barrier no rank can ignore. Ezekiel had already declared, &#8220;On the day he enters the holy place, he is to offer a bull for his own sin offering&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>). <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a> notes, &#8220;Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.&#8221; While Christ has now provided the once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>), Ezekiel&#8217;s temple vision highlights the timeless principle: ministry flows from atoned, forgiven hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><p>The verse closes with God&#8217;s personal signature. When Ezekiel writes &#8220;declares the Lord GOD,&#8221; he affirms absolute authority behind the command. Similar endings appear throughout the book (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a>), sealing each directive with divine weight. <a href="/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a> adds, &#8220;For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.&#8221; The priest&#8217;s obligations, the temple&#8217;s design, the sacrifices&#8212;none are human inventions; all stand on the unassailable word of the covenant-keeping LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/44-27.htm">Ezekiel 44:27</a> teaches that every approach to God demands reverence, preparation, and atonement, even for those called to serve. On the very day a priest steps into the inner court to minister, he must first acknowledge his own sin by sacrifice, because God Himself has decreed it. Holiness is not optional, privilege never replaces repentance, and the Lord&#8217;s authority governs every detail of worship&#8212;then, now, and forever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And on the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
