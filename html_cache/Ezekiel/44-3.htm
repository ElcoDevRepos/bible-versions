In the context of Ezekiel's vision, the prince is often interpreted as a leader or ruler of Israel, possibly a Davidic figure, symbolizing the restoration of the monarchy. The gateway, part of the temple complex, signifies a place of access to God's presence, highlighting the prince's unique role in mediating between God and the people. This exclusivity underscores the sanctity and order of worship in the restored temple.<p><b>to eat in the presence of the LORD.</b><br>Eating in the presence of the LORD signifies fellowship and communion with God, reminiscent of covenant meals in the Old Testament, such as those described in <a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>. This act symbolizes peace and acceptance before God, reflecting the prince's role in maintaining the covenant relationship. It also foreshadows the Messianic banquet, a theme found in prophetic literature and the New Testament, where believers will dine in the presence of Christ.<p><b>He must enter by way of the portico of the gateway</b><br>The portico, or vestibule, serves as a transitional space leading into the sacred area, emphasizing the order and reverence required in approaching God's presence. This prescribed entryway for the prince highlights the importance of following divine instructions, reflecting the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commands. The specific mention of the portico may also have architectural significance, aligning with descriptions of temple structures in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>and go out the same way.</b><br>The requirement for the prince to exit the same way he entered underscores the principle of order and reverence in worship. It may symbolize the consistency and faithfulness expected of the prince in his duties. This instruction also reflects the broader biblical theme of returning to one's origins or maintaining a path of righteousness, as seen in various scriptural narratives. The emphasis on a single path in and out could also symbolize the singularity of Christ as the way to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>In the context of Ezekiel, the prince is a leader or ruler of the people.

Ezekiel&#8217;s larger section (chapters 40&#8211;48) lays out a literal, future temple. In that setting the prince is a real leader from David&#8217;s line, as promised in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24 and 37</a>:24-25.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Only&#8221; marks a divinely assigned privilege.

Entering there underscores reverence and order.<p>&#8226; The directive protects against irreverent shortcuts (compare <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>). God details the prince&#8217;s steps because holiness governs even the movement of leaders (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Structuring approach to God foreshadows the truth that no one comes to the Father except through the appointed way (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go out the same way</b><p>&#8226; Exiting as he entered keeps the prince from mingling casually with areas reserved for priests or for the people (<a href="/ezekiel/46-8.htm">Ezekiel 46:8-10</a> draws a similar boundary).<p>&#8226; The pattern models consistency&#8212;authority that honors God neither veers off course nor seeks personal elevation (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It also preserves the symbolism of the closed east gate: the LORD&#8217;s glory has entered (<a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>), and no mere man may use that passage for his own agenda.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a> assigns the Davidic prince a unique privilege&#8212;he alone may sit and eat at the east gateway, yet he must follow a prescribed path in and out. The verse highlights three truths: God honors His covenant by granting the prince special access; true leadership flourishes only in worshipful fellowship with the LORD; and even the highest ruler submits to God&#8217;s precise order. In the coming millennial temple this pattern will visibly blend governance, holiness, and covenant fulfillment under the unchanging kingship of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The prince.</span>--The Rabbis understood this to refer to the Messiah, and unquestionably the same person must be meant as by David in <a href="/context/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. This gives another and a conclusive reason for regarding the sacrificial worship of Ezekiel 46 as symbolical.<p><span class= "bld">To eat bread before the Lord.--</span>This is the common scriptural expression for partaking of the sacrifices (see <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm" title="Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>), and there is no reason for restricting it to the shew-bread and other unbloody offerings. The eating of the latter was an exclusively priestly prerogative, and the "prince" of Ezekiel, though greatly distinguished, is not in any way endued with priestly functions. He is to partake of his sacrificial meals within this highly-honoured gate, while the people eat in the outer court. There has been much discussion as to whether the prince was to go in and out by this gateway, or only, having entered by one of the others, to eat in this. The language here seems sufficiently plain, and if there could be any doubt, it would be removed by <a href="/context/ezekiel/46-1.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.">Ezekiel 46:1-2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-8.htm" title="And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.">Ezekiel 46:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-10.htm" title="And the prince in the middle of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.">Ezekiel 46:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-12.htm" title="Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily to the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.">Ezekiel 46:12</a>. It appears there that the prince is always to enter and leave by this gate except "in the solemn feasts;" then he is to enter in the midst of the people, by either the north or the south gate, and go out by the opposite one. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - It is <span class="cmt_word">for the prince</span> conveys an erroneous impression, as if the edict, excluding all from passing through the east outer gate, did not apply to the prince; but even for him the gate was not to serve as a mode of entrance into the temple, or, if so, only on exceptional occasions (see on Ezekiel 46:2), but merely as a place to sit in. The Revised Version accurately renders the words, <span class="accented">As for the prince</span>, <span class="accented">he shall sit therein as prince</span>, etc. That the "prince" here alluded to (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) could not have been the Prince David, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Messiah already spoken of (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>), but must have denoted the civic authorities of the new community of Israel, "the civil head of the theocracy," Havernick infers from <a href="/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>, where the coming "prince" is contrasted with Israel's previous rulers who oppressed their subjects, from the absence of some such characteristic predicate as "shepherd" or "king," which would, he thinks, have been attached to the word "prince" had it been intended to designate Messiah, from the prince's offering for himself a sin offering (<a href="/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>), from the allusion to his sons (<a href="/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>), and from what is recorded about his behavior in worship (<a href="/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a>); but none of these statements concerning the "prince' forbids his identification with Messiah, unless on the supposition that it was already understood Messiah should be a Divine-human Personage. This, however, had not then been so distinctly revealed as to be widely and accurately known. Hence it seems enough to say that while the "prince" would have his highest antitype in the Messiah, he would also have, though in a lower and lesser degree, an antitype in every righteous ruler (if ever there should be such) who might subsequently preside over Israel (see on Ezekiel 37:25). The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">to eat bread before the Lord,</span> while referring in the first instance to those sacrificial meals which, under the Law, commonly accompanied unbloody offerings, as the meat offerings (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), the showbread (<a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), and the unleavened leaves of the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>), and could only be partaken of by the priests, in the second instance signified to partake of sacrificial meals in general, even of such as consisted of the portions of flesh which were eaten in connection with ordinary bloody offerings (<a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If, after Kliefoth, the former be adopted as the import of the phrase here, then the thought will be that in the new cultus the prince should enjoy a privilege which under the old was not possessed even by the king; if, after Keil, the second view be preferred, the sense will amount to this, that under the regulations of the future the prince should have the favor accorded him "of holding his sacrificial meals in the gate," whereas the people should only be permitted to hold theirs "in the court," or "in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens." <span class="cmt_word">The way of the porch</span> is mentioned as the ingress and egress for the prince; which implies that he should obtain access to the outer court by either the north or the south gate, since the outer door of the east gate was shut. This renders it probable that Ezekiel was himself standing on the outside of the east gate (see on ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Only the prince</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
