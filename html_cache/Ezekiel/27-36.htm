Tyre was a major Phoenician port city known for its extensive trade networks across the Mediterranean. The "hiss" signifies scorn and derision, a common reaction to a once-great power's fall. In biblical context, hissing is often associated with judgment and derision (<a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). The traders, who once benefited from Tyre's wealth, now mock its demise, illustrating the transient nature of worldly riches and alliances.<p><b>you have come to a horrible end</b><br>The "horrible end" refers to the complete destruction and desolation of Tyre. Historically, Tyre faced multiple sieges, most notably by Nebuchadnezzar II and later by Alexander the Great. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of prophetic judgment against Tyre for its pride and opposition to God's people (<a href="/ezekiel/26-3.htm">Ezekiel 26:3-14</a>). Theologically, it serves as a warning against hubris and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and will be no more.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the totality and permanence of Tyre's destruction. While the city was rebuilt after various sieges, the prophecy points to its ultimate insignificance and loss of former glory. This can be seen as a type of final judgment, reflecting the ultimate fate of all who oppose God's will. In a broader biblical context, it echoes the theme of divine justice and the eventual triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers (<a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
