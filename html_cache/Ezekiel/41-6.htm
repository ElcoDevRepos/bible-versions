The three levels suggest a structured hierarchy, possibly symbolizing the completeness and perfection of God's plan. The number thirty may be significant, as numbers often hold symbolic meaning in Scripture. Thirty could represent dedication or maturity, as seen in the age at which Levites began their service (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>). The arrangement of these rooms reflects the meticulous care in the construction of the temple, emphasizing the holiness and sanctity of the space dedicated to God.<p><b>There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms,</b><br>The ledges around the temple walls served a practical purpose, providing stability and support for the side rooms. This architectural detail highlights the importance of a strong foundation, both physically and spiritually. In a broader biblical context, the concept of support and foundation is echoed in passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where believers are described as being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone. The ledges symbolize the need for a firm spiritual foundation in the life of a believer.<p><b>so that the supports would not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself.</b><br>This detail underscores the sanctity of the temple walls, which were not to be compromised by the supports of the side rooms. It reflects the principle of holiness and separation, a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the sacred is often set apart from the common. This separation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the temple's purpose, being both fully God and fully man, yet without sin. The care taken to preserve the integrity of the temple walls points to the purity and holiness required in approaching God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where believers are encouraged to draw near to God with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future idealized temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/side_chambers.htm">Side Chambers</a></b><br>These are the rooms described in the temple vision, indicating the structure and organization of the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_stories.htm">Three Stories</a></b><br>The architectural design of the temple, with three levels of chambers, signifies order and completeness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offsets.htm">Offsets</a></b><br>Architectural features that provide structural support, symbolizing stability and divine order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_order_and_design.htm">God's Order and Design</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple's structure reflects God's order and intentionality in His dwelling place.

These chambers were exactly like those surrounding Solomon's Temple, except that they were one cubit narrower, and the description of them is made clearer by a comparison with <a href="/context/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5-10</a>. The Greek version says that there was a space between these chambers and the wall of the house, and several interpreters have followed this explanation; but this is quite inconsistent with the language of the original, and would involve an inner wall for the chambers, of which there is no mention, and for which no space is allowed.<p><span class= "bld">Entered into the wall </span>. . . <span class= "bld">but</span> <span class= "bld">they had not hold.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">they came upon the wall.</span> The "house" cannot without violence be understood of anything but the Temple itself.

It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., "chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times," on the ground that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is the preposition, because in Ezekiel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> often stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to "the wall of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be "of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of "ledges," "holds," "rebates," as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be "a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around." <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The side rooms</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
