The imagery of frustration suggests that numerous attempts have been made to cleanse or reform the city, yet all have failed. This can be seen as a reflection of the repeated warnings and calls to repentance given by the prophets, including Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Isaiah. The people of Jerusalem had been given many opportunities to turn back to God, but their hearts remained hardened. This phrase underscores the futility of human efforts without genuine repentance and divine intervention.<p><b>its thick rust has not been removed,</b><br>The "thick rust" symbolizes the deep-seated sin and moral decay of Jerusalem. In ancient metallurgy, rust represents impurity and corruption that weakens metal. Similarly, the spiritual and moral corruption of the city has become so ingrained that it cannot be easily removed. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe sin as a stain or impurity, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sin is likened to scarlet and crimson. The persistence of the rust indicates the depth of the city's rebellion against God and the ineffectiveness of superficial attempts at reform.<p><b>even by the fire.</b><br>Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of judgment and purification. In this context, it represents the severe trials and judgments that God has allowed to come upon Jerusalem, including the Babylonian siege and eventual destruction. Despite these intense trials, the city's corruption remains. This suggests that the judgment, while severe, has not led to the desired purification or repentance. The use of fire also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's refining process, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God is described as a refiner's fire purifying His people. However, in this case, the fire has not achieved its purpose, highlighting the depth of Jerusalem's iniquity and the necessity of divine intervention for true cleansing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
