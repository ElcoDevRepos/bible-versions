Egypt, a powerful and ancient civilization, was known for its fertile land due to the Nile River. The desolation foretold here signifies a complete reversal of Egypt's prosperity and strength. Historically, Egypt had been a dominant power, often seen as a refuge or ally by Israel. The prophecy underscores God's sovereignty over nations, emphasizing that even the mightiest can be brought low. This desolation serves as a divine judgment for Egypt's pride and idolatry.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, highlighting the purpose of God's judgments: to reveal His identity and authority. The recognition of the LORD by the nations, including Egypt, is a central goal of these prophecies. It reflects the biblical principle that God's actions in history are meant to lead people to acknowledge Him as the one true God. This acknowledgment is not just intellectual but involves a recognition of His power, justice, and sovereignty.<p><b>Because you said, &#8216;The Nile is mine; I made it,&#8217;</b><br>This statement reflects the pride and arrogance of Egypt, particularly its rulers, who claimed divine status and control over the Nile, the lifeblood of the nation. The Nile was central to Egypt's economy, agriculture, and religion, often deified and associated with gods like Hapi. By claiming ownership and creation of the Nile, the Egyptians were usurping the role of the Creator, a direct affront to the LORD. This prideful claim is reminiscent of other biblical instances where human arrogance leads to divine judgment, such as the Tower of Babel or Nebuchadnezzar's boast in Babylon. Theologically, it underscores the folly of idolatry and self-deification, contrasting human limitations with God's ultimate authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Just as Babylon&#8217;s armies would sweep through (<a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a>; 30:10), Egypt&#8217;s proud civilization would be reduced, like the once-fertile fields turning barren (<a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when God speaks of Edom (<a href="/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3-4</a>) and Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>), showing that when the Lord decrees desolation, it comes to pass in real space and time.<p>&#8226; Historically, Egypt did suffer conquest under Nebuchadnezzar and later Persians, losing its independence and former glory&#8212;fulfilling the prophecy&#8217;s plain sense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Then they will know that I am the LORD.&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a>)<p>&#8226; Every act of divine judgment carries a redemptive aim: revealing God&#8217;s identity. Exodus began with &#8220;The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>), and Ezekiel repeats that refrain more than sixty times (e.g., 30:19; 36:23).<p>&#8226; For Egypt, the collapse of their gods and military power would expose the true Sovereign. For Israel, watching the demise of an erstwhile ally (29:6-7) would remind them to rely on God alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores God&#8217;s patience: He intervenes not merely to punish but to call nations to acknowledge Him (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because you said, &#8216;The Nile is mine; I made it,&#8217;</b><p>&#8220;Because you said, &#8216;The Nile is mine; I made it.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a>)<p>&#8226; Pharaoh arrogantly claimed creator-rights over the Nile&#8212;the lifeline of Egypt. This echoes his earlier boast, &#8220;Who is the LORD, that I should obey Him?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Such pride turns a blessing into an idol. The Nile, designed by God (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1-2</a>), became a reason for Pharaoh to exalt himself. Like the king of Tyre&#8217;s hubris (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>) or Herod&#8217;s self-glorification (<a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21-23</a>), self-deification invites swift judgment.<p>&#8226; God alone declares, &#8220;I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not yield My glory to another&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). When any ruler claims divine prerogatives, the Lord responds to protect His glory and guide people back to truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a> warns that Egypt&#8217;s fertile realm would become barren, and that devastation would compel Egyptians&#8212;and observing nations&#8212;to recognize the Lord&#8217;s unrivaled authority. The catalyst for judgment is Pharaoh&#8217;s prideful claim to divine ownership of the Nile. God&#8217;s response underscores three truths: He rules history, He disciplines nations that exalt themselves, and He uses judgment as a stage for revelation, inviting every heart to acknowledge, honor, and depend on Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Because he hath said.--</span>Again, as in <a href="/ezekiel/29-6.htm" title="And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 29:6</a>, the division of the verses is very unfortunate.
