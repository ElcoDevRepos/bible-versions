The mention of these locations highlights the geographical scope of the judgment. The sword symbolizes warfare and destruction, a common motif in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>).

Edom, descended from Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>), repeatedly opposed Israel (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a> reinforces that pride and violence toward Jacob&#8217;s descendants would bring divine retaliation.

His outstretched hand guarantees unstoppable intervention, wiping out every creature, turning the land into desolation, and ensuring that from north to south none will escape the sword.
