Persia, known for its vast empire, was a significant power in the ancient Near East. Lydia, located in what is now western Turkey, was known for its wealth and military prowess. Put is often associated with regions in North Africa, possibly modern-day Libya. The inclusion of these nations indicates Tyre's extensive trade networks and influence, drawing on the military expertise of various peoples. This diversity reflects the city's reliance on foreign alliances and mercenaries, a common practice in ancient warfare. The use of foreign warriors also underscores the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations through trade and military alliances.<p><b>They hung their shields and helmets on your walls;</b><br>The imagery of shields and helmets adorning the walls of Tyre symbolizes both protection and prestige. In ancient times, displaying military equipment on city walls was a sign of strength and readiness for battle. It also served as a deterrent to potential aggressors, showcasing the city's formidable defenses. This practice was not only practical but also ceremonial, reflecting the honor and status of the warriors who served there. The presence of such equipment from diverse regions further emphasizes Tyre's wealth and the high regard in which it was held by its allies.<p><b>they gave you splendor.</b><br>The splendor mentioned here refers to the glory and magnificence that Tyre derived from its military alliances and the protection they provided. The city's prosperity was closely tied to its ability to maintain strong defenses and secure trade routes. The presence of elite warriors from various nations contributed to Tyre's reputation as a powerful and influential city. This splendor can also be seen as a metaphor for the city's economic and cultural achievements, which were supported by its military strength. The passage highlights the transient nature of such splendor, as later prophecies in Ezekiel foretell Tyre's downfall, serving as a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly power and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/persia.htm">Persia</a></b><br>An ancient empire located in what is now Iran.

Their mention locates Tyre&#8217;s influence all around the Mediterranean world&#8212;literally &#8220;from east to west.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often lists these nations as military powers for hire (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). That confirms the historical reality that Tyre, a merchant empire, attracted elite soldiers from every corner of its trading networks.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God sees and records even the geopolitical details of history. Just as <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a> says He &#8220;removes kings and establishes them,&#8221; He also tracks which nations lend their swords to others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Served as warriors in your army</b><p>&#8226; The phrase shows Tyre&#8217;s dependence on foreign mercenaries rather than on the Lord for security&#8212;echoing Israel&#8217;s earlier warning in <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, &#8220;Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help&#8230; but do not look to the Holy One of Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Tyre&#8217;s strategy looked wise in worldly terms: hire the best fighters, keep commerce flowing. Yet <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> exposes the folly of trusting &#8220;in chariots and some in horses.&#8221;<p>&#8226; As believers, we are cautioned not to rest on alliances, savings accounts, or strategies, but on God Himself (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They hung their shields and helmets on your walls</b><p>&#8226; Shields and helmets on the ramparts were more than storage; they were deliberate displays of strength. Song of Songs 4:4 likens a tower &#8220;adorned with a thousand shields.&#8221; In the same way, Tyre&#8217;s walls glittered with armor, sending a message: &#8220;We are impregnable.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Solomon once made &#8220;three hundred shields of hammered gold&#8221; for display (<a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>). Tyre copies the idea, but its motive is pride, not worship.<p>&#8226; The picture is tangible evidence that Ezekiel&#8217;s lament (27:1-11) isn&#8217;t poetry alone; it is grounded in literal structures and defenses God had seen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They gave you splendor</b><p>&#8226; The imported warriors enhanced Tyre&#8217;s fame, wealth, and self-confidence. <a href="/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a> records that Tyre&#8217;s king became &#8220;proud because of your beauty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet splendor built on human achievement is fleeting. When judgment falls, <a href="/revelation/18-15.htm">Revelation 18:15-17</a> shows merchants wailing over a fallen world system: &#8220;In one hour her riches have been brought to nothing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse warns us that external glory&#8212;military, economic, or cultural&#8212;cannot replace obedience to the Lord (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a> literally recounts Tyre&#8217;s recruitment of Persia, Lydia, and Put as elite soldiers whose proudly displayed armor added to the city&#8217;s glittering reputation. While the detail underscores Tyre&#8217;s global reach, it also exposes the city&#8217;s misplaced trust in human power and outward splendor. God&#8217;s record of these facts reminds us that every alliance, trophy, and source of earthly pride will fall before His sovereign judgment, urging believers today to rely wholly on Him rather than on the impressive walls of worldly strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Of Persia and of Lud and of Phut.</span>--Tyre, like most commercial nations, depended chiefly on mercenaries for the rank and file of its army. Persia, more anciently called Elam, was just now rising into prominence. Its soldiers were probably obtained by the Tyrians from their commerce in the Persian Gulf. Lud is not the one mentioned among the children of Shem (<a href="/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), but the Ludim (Lydians) of Hamite family, descended from Mizraim (<a href="/genesis/10-13.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">Genesis 10:13</a>). Phut was also an African tribe (<a href="/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>).

The Lubim (Libyans) are named as forming part of Shishak's army in <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>, and in <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> as closely allied with the Egyptians. Ezekiel names Phut again as sharing in the fall of Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), and as serving in the army of Gog (<a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). Mr. R. S. Peele is inclined to identify them with the Nubians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Persia,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1448;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;ras)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6539.htm">Strong's 6539: </a> </span><span class="str2">Persia -- a country in west Asia which conquered Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Lydia,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#363;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
