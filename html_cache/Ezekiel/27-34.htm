The imagery of being "shattered by the seas" symbolizes the overwhelming force of God's judgment, as the sea was both a source of wealth and a potential threat. In biblical literature, the sea often represents chaos and danger (<a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-3</a>). Tyre's reliance on the sea for its prosperity becomes its downfall, illustrating the biblical principle that what one trusts in apart from God can lead to destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>).<p><b>in the depths of the waters</b><br>The "depths of the waters" emphasize the totality and finality of Tyre's destruction. This imagery suggests a complete submersion, indicating that Tyre's fall is not just a surface-level defeat but a profound and irreversible one. The depths also evoke the idea of Sheol, the realm of the dead, further underscoring the city's demise (<a href="/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19-21</a>). Historically, Tyre was a city with both a mainland and an island part, making the sea a literal and figurative element of its identity and downfall.<p><b>your merchandise and the people among you have gone down with you</b><br>This phrase highlights the economic and social impact of Tyre's destruction. Tyre was renowned for its trade and wealth, as detailed earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, which lists its extensive commercial network. The loss of merchandise signifies the collapse of its economic power, while the mention of "the people among you" indicates the loss of life and community. This serves as a warning against the pride and self-sufficiency that can accompany wealth (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). The fall of Tyre prefigures the ultimate judgment of Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where similar language is used to describe the fall of a great commercial power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient and wealthy city-state located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its trade and commerce.

Scripture is clear that the LORD directs even natural forces to accomplish His purposes. The literal fall of Tyre fulfilled the warning in <a href="/ezekiel/26-3.htm">Ezekiel 26:3</a>: &#8220;I will bring many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the depths of the waters</b><p>Depth signals finality and hopelessness&#8212;once the ship sinks, recovery is impossible (see <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>; <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>). Tyre&#8217;s proud position &#8220;at the entrance to the sea&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>) is turned against her. God often employs the very arena of a nation&#8217;s strength to execute judgment (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your merchandise</b><p>Tyre&#8217;s wealth was legendary (<a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12&#8211;24</a>).

Every crate of purple dye, every bar of silver went down. <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11&#8211;17</a> echoes the same pattern: commercial empires fall swiftly when God&#8217;s wrath arrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the people among you</b><p>Judgment is personal.

God uses the sea&#8212;Tyre&#8217;s source of pride&#8212;to break her, sinking her wealth and people alike. The verse warns that unchecked arrogance and trust in riches invite God&#8217;s sure, literal judgment, while also pointing every reader to repent and find safety in Him alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/27-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6256.htm">Strong's 6256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Time, now, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are shattered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#353;&#183;be&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7665.htm">Strong's 7665: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break, break in pieces</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the seas</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;yam&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
