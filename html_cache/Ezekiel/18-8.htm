Usury, or charging excessive interest, was seen as exploiting the poor and needy, contrary to the community's covenantal values. This principle reflects God's concern for justice and compassion, ensuring that the vulnerable are not oppressed. The prohibition against usury underscores the importance of fairness and integrity in financial dealings, aligning with the broader biblical theme of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>but he withholds his hand from iniquity</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility in avoiding sin and wrongdoing. Iniquity refers to moral corruption and injustice, which are contrary to God's righteous standards. The imagery of withholding one's hand suggests a deliberate choice to refrain from actions that lead to sin. This aligns with the call to holiness found throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>) and reflects the transformative power of a life committed to God's ways.<p><b>and executes true justice between men</b><br>Executing true justice involves impartiality and fairness in resolving disputes and making decisions. This reflects God's character as a just judge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) and is a key aspect of righteous leadership. The biblical mandate for justice is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and His people, where leaders are called to reflect divine justice in their governance (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). This principle is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized justice, mercy, and faithfulness (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, they were in exile due to their disobedience to God, and Ezekiel's messages often called them to repentance and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies and emphasizing the need for a return to God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_financial_practices.htm">Righteous Financial Practices</a></b><br>Christians are called to conduct their financial dealings with integrity, avoiding exploitation and usury, reflecting God's justice and compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their actions.

This was strictly forbidden in the law to be taken of any Hebrew, though allowed, without limit as to amount, from foreigners. It had nothing to do with the regulation of commercial transactions, but was simply a law of kindness to a fellow member of the same household of faith in a primitive state of society. The Israelite was to lend freely to his impoverished neighbour to assist him, but without any expectation of gain for himself.<p><span class= "bld">Executed true judgment.--</span>This applies, of course, especially and directly to judicial sentences, but extends also to all cases in which one is brought to intervene in any way in transactions between others. What is required is absolute fairness, truthfulness, and integrity in the constant transactions of man with man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath not given forth his money upon usury.</span> The word "usury," we must remember, is used, not, as with us, for exorbitant interest above the market rate, but for interest of any kind. This was allowed in commercial dealings with foreigners (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>), but was altogether forbidden in the case of loans to Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 37</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>: <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>). The principle implied in this distinction was that, although it was, on strict principles of justice, allowable to charge for the use of money, as for the use of lands or the hire of cattle, Israel, as a people, was under the higher law of brotherhood. If money was to be lent at all, it was to be lent as to a brother in went (<a href="/matthew/5-42.htm">Matthew 5:42</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>), for the relief of his necessities, and not to make profit. A brother who would not help a brother by a loan without interest was thought unworthy of the name. The ideal of the social polity of Israel was that it was to consist of a population of small freeholders, bound together by ties of mutual help - a national friendly society, rather than of traders and manufacturers; and hence the whole drift of its legislation tended to repress the money making spirit which afterwards became specially characteristic of its people, and ate like a canker into its life. The distinction between the two words seems to be that "usury" represents any interest on money; and "increase," any profit on the sale of goods beyond the cost of production, as measured by the maintenance of the worker and his family. To buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest was not to be the rule in a nation of brothers, and it was wiser to forbid it altogether rather than to sanction what we call a "reasonable rate" of interest or profit. <span class="cmt_word">Hath executed true judgment</span>.
