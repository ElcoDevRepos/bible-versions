Hauran, a fertile area, is often associated with the modern-day region of southern Syria. Damascus, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities, was a major center of trade and culture. The mention of these locations indicates the northern extent of the eastern boundary of the land described in Ezekiel's vision. This boundary reflects the historical territories of Israel and their interactions with neighboring nations, emphasizing the restoration and reestablishment of Israel's promised land.<p><b>along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel</b><br>The Jordan River is a significant geographical and spiritual landmark in the Bible, symbolizing transition and divine promise. Gilead, located east of the Jordan, was known for its balm and rugged terrain. This phrase highlights the division between the Transjordan tribes and the rest of Israel, underscoring the unity and completeness of the land in the prophetic vision. The Jordan River also serves as a type of baptism and spiritual renewal, connecting to the New Testament where Jesus was baptized in its waters.<p><b>to the Eastern Sea and as far as Tamar</b><br>The Eastern Sea refers to the Dead Sea, a body of water known for its high salinity and unique properties. In biblical prophecy, the Dead Sea often symbolizes judgment and desolation, but in Ezekiel's vision, it is part of the restored land, indicating transformation and life. Tamar, possibly located near the southern end of the Dead Sea, marks the southern extent of the eastern boundary. This geographical detail emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the land's restoration, from north to south, and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<p><b>This will be the eastern boundary</b><br>The establishment of boundaries in biblical texts often signifies order, possession, and divine mandate. This eastern boundary delineates the extent of the land promised to Israel, reflecting God's covenant faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of the historical and future significance of the land in God's redemptive plan. The precise boundaries also foreshadow the ultimate restoration and peace that will come through the Messiah, who will reign over a renewed creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hauran.htm">Hauran</a></b><br>A region in ancient Syria, known for its fertile land.

In both cases it excludes the territory of the trans- Jordanic tribes, which was not included in Palestine proper, even after its conquest by Moses, and in which the two and a half tribes were allowed to settle with some reluctance (Numbers 32). The word "from," occurring four times in this verse, is literally <span class= "ital">from between,</span> as is noted in the margin; it means that the boundary was to run between the territories of Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead on the one side, and that of Israel on the other. The boundary is to be the Jordan; but as this does not extend so far north, it became necessary to mention the territory of Damascus as bounding the land of Israel, and in this connection Hauran and Gilead are also spoken of. The boundary extends, as of old, beyond the mouth of the Jordan to the southern end of the Dead Sea and thence to Kadesh. The extreme length of the land is somewhat uncertain, but must have fallen short of 250 miles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">The east boundary</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran,</span> etc. The Revised Version, after Keil and Kliefoth, translates, <span class="accented">And the east side</span>, <span class="accented">between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead</span>, <span class="accented">and the land of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">shall be</span> (the) <span class="accented">Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">from the</span> (north) <span class="accented">border unto the east sea shall ye measure</span>.

In any case, by this instruction, first the land of Israel was defined as the territory lying west of the Jordan, and secondly its boundary should extend from the last-named north border at its easternmost point, Hazar-enan, down the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea. The practical effect of this would be to cut off the lands which in the earlier division (<a href="/numbers/34-14.htm">Numbers 34:14, 15</a>) had been assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Otherwise the boundary here given corresponds with that traced in Numbers, though the latter is more minute. Hengstenberg, however, thinks the prophet cannot have intended to assert that the new Israel should not possess the land of Gilead as a frontier in the future as formerly, as in that case he would have been at variance, not only with preexisting Scripture (comp. <a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>;
