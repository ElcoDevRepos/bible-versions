In the historical context, this prophecy was directed towards the inhabitants of Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege. The lack of food and water symbolizes God's judgment and the dire consequences of turning away from His commandments. This situation is reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where disobedience leads to hunger and thirst. The scarcity of resources serves as a physical manifestation of spiritual deprivation.<p><b>they will be appalled at the sight of one another</b><br>The phrase indicates the horror and shock that the people will experience as they witness the effects of the famine and siege on their community. This reflects the communal aspect of suffering, where the distress of one becomes the distress of all. The appalling sight of their neighbors wasting away would serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin. This communal suffering is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9-10</a>, where the dire conditions lead to unimaginable actions among the people.<p><b>wasting away in their iniquity.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the direct connection between sin and its consequences. The term "wasting away" suggests a gradual decline, both physically and spiritually, as a result of persistent iniquity. Theologically, this reflects the principle that sin leads to death, as stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The wasting away is not just a physical deterioration but also a spiritual one, highlighting the destructive power of sin. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, though sinless, took upon Himself the iniquity of humanity and experienced the ultimate consequence of sin&#8212;death&#8212;so that believers might have life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Similar judgments appear in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where God foretells breaking the staff of bread so that &#8220;ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The literal rationing enacted by Ezekiel earlier in the chapter (4:9-11) dramatizes famine and thirst exactly as the residents will endure them.<p>&#8226; Such deprivation underscores the seriousness of covenant disobedience; compare <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, &#8220;in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and lacking everything.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physically, scarcity brings weakness; spiritually, it exposes utter dependence on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Appalled at the sight of one another</b><p>&#8220;they will be appalled at the sight of one another&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Hebrew exiles will watch family and neighbors deteriorate, leaving them shocked and horrified. <a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8-10</a> paints the same grisly reality after the fall of Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; Terror within the city fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-34.htm">Deuteronomy 28:34</a>, &#8220;You will be driven mad by the sights you see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Sin severs community; instead of mutual support, people recoil from each other&#8217;s suffering (<a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God intends the horror to awaken repentance, revealing how sin disfigures both body and soul (<a href="/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wasting away in iniquity</b><p>&#8220;wasting away in their iniquity&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical wasting mirrors spiritual decay; sin consumes from the inside out (<a href="/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later repeats the phrase in 24:23 to show the ongoing consequence of rebellion.<p>&#8226; The judgment is just: they chose idolatry, so God hands them over to its destructive fruit (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even here, hope glimmers: God&#8217;s goal is eventual restoration. After judgment, He promises a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>), proving His discipline aims at redemption, not annihilation (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> delivers a solemn, literal warning: famine and thirst will strike Jerusalem, shocking survivors as they watch one another physically and spiritually waste away because of persistent sin.
