This period, lasting 40 years, is marked by numerous instances of rebellion, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the refusal to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14). The wilderness symbolizes a place of testing and purification, where God sought to teach Israel dependence on Him.<p><b>They did not follow My statutes and they rejected My ordinances&#8212;</b><br>God's statutes and ordinances were given to Israel as a covenantal framework for living in relationship with Him. These laws, delivered through Moses, were meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The rejection of these laws signifies a deeper spiritual rebellion, as they were not merely legalistic requirements but expressions of God's character and will.<p><b>though the man who does these things will live by them&#8212;</b><br>This phrase underscores the life-giving nature of God's commandments. It echoes <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, which emphasizes that obedience to God's laws leads to life. This principle is reiterated in the New Testament, where Paul references it in <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>, contrasting the law's demands with the righteousness that comes by faith in Christ.<p><b>and they utterly profaned My Sabbaths.</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Profaning the Sabbath was a serious offense, as it represented a rejection of God's provision and rest. The Sabbath also foreshadows the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), making its profanation a type of rejecting the ultimate rest offered through Jesus.<p><b>Then I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and put an end to them in the wilderness.</b><br>God's wrath is a response to sin and rebellion, demonstrating His holiness and justice. The threat to "put an end to them" recalls the incident at Kadesh Barnea, where God considered destroying Israel after their refusal to enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>). However, God's mercy prevailed, and He spared the nation, though the rebellious generation perished in the wilderness. This tension between justice and mercy is ultimately resolved in Christ, who bore God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who were delivered from Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt, a place of testing and revelation of their faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_statutes_and_ordinances.htm">God's Statutes and Ordinances</a></b><br>The laws and commands given by God to the Israelites, intended to guide them in righteous living and maintain their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbaths.htm">Sabbaths</a></b><br>The holy days of rest instituted by God as a sign of His covenant with Israel, meant to be a time of rest and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wrath.htm">God's Wrath</a></b><br>The righteous anger of God in response to the rebellion and disobedience of His people, demonstrating His justice and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rebellion.htm">The Seriousness of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God is not a trivial matter.
