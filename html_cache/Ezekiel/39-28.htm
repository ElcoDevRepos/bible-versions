Throughout the Old Testament, knowing God is often associated with experiencing His power and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>). This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, involving trust and obedience. The context of Ezekiel is the restoration of Israel, where God's actions will lead to a renewed understanding of His identity and authority.<p><b>when I regather them to their own land</b><br>The regathering of Israel is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>). Historically, this refers to the return from Babylonian exile, but it also points to a future, eschatological gathering. The land is central to Israel's identity and covenant with God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>. This regathering is both a physical and spiritual restoration, highlighting God's redemptive plan.<p><b>not leaving any of them behind</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness of God's restoration. It reflects the thoroughness of God's promise, ensuring that all of His people are included. This can be seen as a reversal of the scattering due to disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). The inclusivity here points to God's grace and the fulfillment of His covenant, ensuring that none of His chosen people are forgotten.<p><b>after their exile among the nations</b><br>The exile is a significant event in Israel's history, serving as both punishment and purification (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20-21</a>). It represents a period of judgment but also hope for future restoration. The scattering among the nations fulfills earlier prophecies of dispersion due to unfaithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>). The return from exile is a testament to God's mercy and the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who demonstrates His sovereignty and faithfulness through His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were sent into exile due to their disobedience but are promised restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were scattered among the nations as a consequence of their sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The foreign lands where the Israelites were dispersed during their exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/their_own_land.htm">Their own land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, the promised land to which God promises to gather His people back.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is in control of history, and His promises are sure.
