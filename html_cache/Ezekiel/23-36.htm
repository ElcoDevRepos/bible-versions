In the context of the prophetic books, such divine communication underscores the authority and seriousness of the message. The phrase "the LORD said" is a common introduction in prophetic literature, emphasizing that the message is not of human origin but divinely inspired. This sets the stage for a message of judgment and correction.<p><b>Son of man,</b><br>"Son of man" is a title used frequently in Ezekiel, highlighting the prophet's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. It contrasts the divine nature of God with the human nature of Ezekiel, emphasizing the humility and mortality of the prophet. This title is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus, to emphasize His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah?</b><br>Oholah and Oholibah are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively. Oholah means "her own tent," representing Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had set up its own places of worship apart from Jerusalem. Oholibah means "my tent is in her," representing Jerusalem, the capital of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, where God's temple was located. The use of these names personifies the cities as sisters, highlighting their shared heritage and their spiritual infidelity. The question posed by God is rhetorical, emphasizing the inevitability of judgment due to their actions.<p><b>Then declare to them their abominations.</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to the idolatrous practices and moral corruption that both Samaria and Jerusalem engaged in. In the biblical context, abominations often relate to practices that are detestable to God, particularly idolatry and the associated immoral behaviors. The declaration of these abominations serves as a call to repentance and a warning of impending judgment. This theme of declaring abominations is consistent with the prophetic role of calling out sin and urging a return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His judgments and commands through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_man.htm">Son of Man</a></b><br>A title used for Ezekiel, emphasizing his role as a human messenger of God's divine message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah.htm">Oholah</a></b><br>A symbolic name for Samaria, representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for its idolatry and alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah</a></b><br>A symbolic name for Jerusalem, representing the Southern Kingdom of Judah, also guilty of spiritual adultery and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous practices and moral corruption that both kingdoms engaged in, which were detestable in the sight of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_adultery.htm">Understanding Spiritual Adultery</a></b><br>Recognize that idolatry and unfaithfulness to God are akin to spiritual adultery.

This repeated formula reminds us:<p>&#8226; God still speaks with absolute authority (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Revelation is not a human construct; it is divinely sourced and therefore completely trustworthy (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>).<p>Because the voice is the LORD&#8217;s, the message that follows is non-negotiable&#8212;a literal, historical confrontation with sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Son of man, will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah?</b><p>The familiar title &#8220;son of man&#8221; grounds Ezekiel in his humanity while underscoring his prophetic task (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>). The question God asks is rhetorical&#8212;He is commissioning Ezekiel to deliver an unmistakable verdict.<p>&#8226; Oholah represents Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, toppled by Assyria in 722 BC (<a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Oholibah stands for Jerusalem, seat of Judah, now on the brink of Babylonian invasion (<a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>By naming both sisters, God levels the playing field: past collapse in the north and imminent collapse in the south flow from the same sins. Cross references pile on the evidence&#8212;Jer 3:6&#8211;11 parallels the charges, and <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4&#8211;14</a> exposes identical harlotries. God&#8217;s question calls Ezekiel to be more than a spectator; he must issue a real, courtroom-style judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then declare to them their abominations</b><p>&#8220;Abominations&#8221; translates into a catalog of offenses that Israel and Judah treated lightly but God takes with utmost seriousness (<a href="/ezekiel/22-2.htm">Ezekiel 22:2&#8211;12</a>).

The prophet&#8217;s job is to unveil sin so that the hearers see it as God sees it (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11-13</a>). Only then can righteous judgment be understood as just.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-36.htm">Ezekiel 23:36</a> captures a pivotal moment: God speaks, commissions His prophet, and demands a fearless exposure of sin. Oholah and Oholibah, representing Samaria and Jerusalem, have accumulated abominations so glaring that judgment is inevitable. The passage underscores divine authority, the necessity of confronting sin, and the certainty that God&#8217;s verdict is always right. Taking Scripture&#8217;s accuracy at face value, we are reminded that God still calls His people to hear, repent, and walk in covenant faithfulness, lest the same righteous Judge expose our own hidden abominations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Wilt thou judge?</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">judge thou, </span>as in <a href="/ezekiel/20-4.htm" title="Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:">Ezekiel 20:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-2.htm" title="Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yes, you shall show her all her abominations.">Ezekiel 22:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - As often, Ezekiel emphasizes by reiteration, begins yet a fresh discourse with the same words, <span class="cmt_word">wilt thou judge</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a> and Ezekiel 22:2, and enters on another summary of the sins of the two harlot sisters, in which Moloch-worship (Ver. 37) and sabbath-breaking (Ver. 38) were conspicuous elements.
