Historically, Egypt was a powerful and influential nation, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and idolatry. The judgment on Egypt is part of a series of prophecies against nations that opposed Israel, demonstrating God's sovereignty over all nations. This judgment is consistent with God's actions throughout the Old Testament, where He uses nations to accomplish His purposes and then holds them accountable for their actions. The execution of judgment is a reminder of God's justice and His ability to humble even the mightiest of empires.<p><b>and they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the purpose behind God's judgment: to reveal His identity and authority. The recognition of God as the LORD is a recurring theme in the book of Ezekiel, where God's actions are intended to lead people to acknowledge His sovereignty. In the context of Egypt, a nation with its own pantheon of gods, this acknowledgment would be a significant shift, highlighting the supremacy of the God of Israel over all other deities. This revelation is not only for Egypt but serves as a testimony to all nations of God's power and the truth of His word. The phrase also points to a future hope where all nations will recognize and submit to God's rule, a theme that resonates with eschatological prophecies found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
