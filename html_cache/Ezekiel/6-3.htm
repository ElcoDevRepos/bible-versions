It emphasizes the role of the prophet as a messenger who must faithfully deliver God's message to the people. Prophets in the Old Testament often served as intermediaries between God and Israel, conveying divine warnings, judgments, and promises.<p><b>&#8216;O mountains of Israel,</b><br>The mountains of Israel symbolize the entire land and its people. Mountains often represent stability and permanence in biblical literature. However, they also serve as locations for idolatrous worship, which is a central issue in this passage. The address to the mountains underscores the seriousness of the message, as the land itself is called to witness God's judgment.<p><b>hear the word of the Lord GOD!</b><br>This call to hear signifies the importance and authority of the message. In Hebrew culture, hearing implies obedience. The phrase "the word of the Lord GOD" highlights the divine origin of the message, emphasizing that it is not Ezekiel's own words but those of the sovereign Lord.<p><b>This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills,</b><br>The repetition of "the Lord GOD" underscores the authority and certainty of the message. The mention of "mountains and hills" again points to the geographical features of Israel, which were often sites of pagan worship. This reflects the widespread nature of idolatry in the land.<p><b>to the ravines and valleys:</b><br>Ravines and valleys, like mountains and hills, are part of the natural landscape of Israel. They are included to show that no part of the land is exempt from God's judgment. These areas were also sometimes used for idol worship, further justifying the comprehensive nature of the coming judgment.<p><b>I am about to bring a sword against you,</b><br>The "sword" is a metaphor for war and destruction. It signifies impending judgment and the use of foreign nations as instruments of God's wrath. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian invasion, which was a fulfillment of God's warning through Ezekiel.<p><b>and I will destroy your high places.</b><br>High places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with idolatry and pagan rituals. The destruction of these sites symbolizes the eradication of false worship and the restoration of true worship of Yahweh. This action is both a judgment against idolatry and a call to return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Ezekiel targets the very places where the nation&#8217;s covenant should have been celebrated (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>) yet instead became centers of rebellion.<p>- The phrase reminds us that the created world itself is called to respond when God speaks (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hear the word of the Lord GOD!</b><p>- &#8220;Hear&#8221; is not a polite suggestion; it carries the weight of an imperative command (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> notes that faith comes by hearing).<p>- God&#8217;s title &#8220;Lord GOD&#8221; (Adonai YHWH) stresses His sovereign authority; He is not negotiating but proclaiming judgment (<a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>).<p>- Ezekiel becomes the mouthpiece, affirming that the message is not his opinion but divine revelation (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys:</b><p>- Every contour of the land&#8212;high or low&#8212;has been touched by idolatry (<a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1-3</a>).<p>- A sweeping address like this foreshadows the later promise of restoration to the same terrain (<a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>), showing that judgment and hope target the identical landscape.<p>- The inclusion of &#8220;ravines and valleys&#8221; leaves no hiding place: all creation is summoned as a courtroom (<a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am about to bring a sword against you</b><p>- The &#8220;sword&#8221;

(<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). Judgment now accomplishes what obedience should have done.<p>- King Josiah once cleansed these sites (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-20</a>), but the revival proved temporary; Ezekiel shows that lasting change requires God&#8217;s decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a> personifies the entire landscape of Israel to announce certain, covenant-based judgment. The mountains echo with God&#8217;s authoritative word, the sword of foreign invasion will sweep across every elevation and depression, and the idolatrous high places will be utterly demolished. The verse underscores three truths: God&#8217;s voice is sovereign, His judgment is comprehensive, and His holiness will not tolerate rivals.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">To the rivers, and to the valleys.</span>--These words stand to each other in the same relation as "mountains and hills," that is, they are specifications of the same general character. The word frequently occurring, and uniformly translated in Ezekiel <span class= "ital">rivers, </span>would be better rendered <span class= "ital">ravines. </span>It is a deep sort of valley, along which, at times, a stream might run. Such places were also favourite places for idolatrous rites (see <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>), especially for the worship of the Phoenician Astaroth, the female divinity worshipped in conjunction with Baal. The same putting together of mountains and hills, valleys and ravines, occurs again in <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm" title="And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.">Ezekiel 35:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm" title="Therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;">Ezekiel 36:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-6.htm" title="Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because you have borne the shame of the heathen:">Ezekiel 36:6</a>. By the expression, "I, even I," strong emphasis is placed on the fact that these judgments are from God. Inasmuch as, like most other events in the world, they were to be wrought out by human instrumentality, the attention might easily be taken up with the secondary causes; but by thus declaring them beforehand, and claiming them as His own work, God would make it evident that all was from Him. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to say:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
