In the prophetic books, the phrase "Thus says the Lord GOD" is a common introduction to a divine pronouncement, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This establishes the seriousness and certainty of the forthcoming judgment. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering His words to the people.<p><b>Bring a mob against them:</b><br>The "mob" refers to a group of people or nations that God will use as instruments of judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this often refers to foreign nations that God raises up to execute His judgment on Israel and Judah for their idolatry and unfaithfulness. Historically, this can be linked to the Babylonian conquest, where God used Babylon as a tool to bring about His judgment. The imagery of a mob suggests chaos and overwhelming force, indicating the severity of the punishment.<p><b>And consign them to terror and plunder:</b><br>"Terror" and "plunder" describe the consequences of the judgment. Terror indicates the fear and panic that will grip those being judged, while plunder refers to the loss of possessions and wealth. This reflects the historical reality of ancient warfare, where conquering armies would instill fear and take spoils from the defeated. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God. The use of such terms also connects to the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to national calamity and defeat.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and righteous judge who pronounces judgment on the sinful actions of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>Symbolic names representing Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively, used in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a> to describe their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mob.htm">The Mob</a></b><br>Represents the nations or forces that God uses as instruments of judgment against the unfaithful cities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/terror_and_plunder.htm">Terror and Plunder</a></b><br>The consequences of judgment, indicating the severe punishment and desolation that will befall the cities due to their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God communicates His message of judgment and calls for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is the ultimate judge who uses various means to execute His righteous judgment.

It reminds us that Ezekiel is only the mouthpiece; the message originates from the Sovereign LORD who &#8220;does nothing without revealing His counsel to His servants the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Because God&#8217;s word is flawless (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>) and eternally settled (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>), His pronouncement here will come to pass just as surely as earlier judgments on Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring a mob against them</b><p>&#8211;
