It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the humility and frailty of human nature. The term is also a messianic title used in the New Testament, particularly in reference to Jesus Christ, who is both fully human and fully divine.<p><b>he said to me,</b><br>The speaker here is the divine messenger, often understood to be an angel or a theophany, conveying God's message to Ezekiel. This emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the vision and instructions given to the prophet.<p><b>look with your eyes,</b><br>Ezekiel is instructed to observe carefully, indicating the importance of visual revelation in prophetic experiences. This command suggests that what Ezekiel is about to see is significant and requires his full attention. It also implies that the vision will be detailed and requires discernment.<p><b>hear with your ears,</b><br>The emphasis on hearing indicates that the message is not only visual but also auditory. This dual sensory engagement underscores the completeness of the revelation and the need for Ezekiel to fully comprehend the divine instructions.<p><b>and pay attention to everything I am going to show you,</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the vision. Ezekiel is to be attentive to every detail, suggesting that each aspect of the vision has meaning and purpose. This reflects the meticulous nature of God's plans and the importance of understanding them fully.<p><b>for that is why you have been brought here.</b><br>Ezekiel's presence in this visionary experience is purposeful. It underscores the divine intention behind the revelation and the prophet's role as a mediator between God and Israel. This phrase also suggests a divine appointment and mission for Ezekiel.<p><b>Report to the house of Israel everything you see.</b><br>Ezekiel's task is to communicate the vision to the people of Israel. This reflects the prophetic responsibility to convey God's messages to His people, often calling them to repentance or offering hope. The phrase also indicates the communal aspect of prophecy, where the revelation is not just for the prophet but for the entire community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with conveying them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Often interpreted as an angelic figure or a divine messenger, this man guides Ezekiel through the vision of the new temple, providing instructions and measurements.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_temple.htm">The Vision of the Temple</a></b><br>This vision, beginning in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, describes a future temple, symbolizing God's presence and the restoration of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, who are the intended audience for Ezekiel's messages and visions, representing God's covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/attentiveness_to_god's_revelation.htm">Attentiveness to God's Revelation</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was instructed to look, hear, and pay attention, believers are called to be attentive to God's Word and His revelations in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_share_god's_message.htm">Responsibility to Share God's Message</a></b><br>Ezekiel's task to report everything he saw to the house of Israel highlights the responsibility of believers to share God's truth with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>The vision of the temple serves as a reminder of God's promise to restore and dwell with His people, offering hope and encouragement in times of trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_temple.htm">Symbolism of the Temple</a></b><br>Understanding the temple as a symbol of God's presence encourages believers to seek a deeper relationship with Him, recognizing that they are now the temple of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_40_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 40:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_40_4_Importance_of_attentiveness.htm">How does Ezekiel 40:4 emphasize the importance of attentiveness in spiritual matters?
