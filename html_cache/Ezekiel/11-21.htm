In biblical context, the heart represents the inner being, including thoughts, desires, and will. The "detestable things and abominations" refer to idolatry and practices that are abhorrent to God, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>. Historically, Israel struggled with idolatry, often adopting the practices of surrounding nations, which led to their downfall. This pursuit of abominations is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and reflects a heart turned away from God. The phrase underscores the importance of internal devotion to God rather than mere external compliance.<p><b>I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the principle of divine justice and retribution. The imagery of bringing conduct down upon one's own head suggests that individuals will face the consequences of their actions. This is consistent with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. In the historical context of Ezekiel, this prophecy was fulfilled when Jerusalem fell to Babylon, and the people experienced the consequences of their idolatry and rebellion. Theologically, it emphasizes God's righteousness and the certainty of His judgment against sin.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the Lord GOD" affirms the authority and certainty of the message. In Hebrew, the term used for "Lord GOD" is "Adonai Yahweh," emphasizing both God's sovereignty and His covenant relationship with Israel. This declaration assures the reader that the prophecy is not merely Ezekiel's words but a divine pronouncement. It reflects the consistent biblical theme that God is both just and faithful, holding His people accountable while also being committed to His covenant promises. This assurance of divine authority is meant to instill both reverence and a call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Israelites who were taken captive to Babylon, representing those who have turned away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is central to the Israelites' identity and faith, which is under judgment for its idolatry and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_and_detestable_images.htm">Idols and Detestable Images</a></b><br>Represent the false gods and practices that the Israelites have adopted, leading them away from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God who declares judgment on those who pursue idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

This warns us that neutrality is impossible; we are either pursuing God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>) or running after idols (<a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads</b><p>- God promises a precise, personal judgment: their deeds will rebound on them (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>- Principle repeated throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; &#8220;They will eat the fruit of their ways&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked&#8230; a man reaps what he sows&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>- In Ezekiel&#8217;s context, this foretells exile, famine, and sword (<a href="/ezekiel/11-8.htm">Ezekiel 11:8&#8211;10</a>). God&#8217;s justice is not arbitrary; He lets sin boomerang back on the sinner.<p>- Yet the verse also implies God&#8217;s restraint&#8212;He does not let rebellion go unchecked, thereby preserving the moral order (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><p>- The closing formula stamps divine authority. What follows is not a human prediction but the sovereign decree of the covenant LORD (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<p>- Because God&#8217;s word cannot fail (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>), His announcement of judgment is certain unless there is genuine repentance, as seen with Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>).<p>- This final phrase also gives weight to the whole passage: obeying, trusting, and fearing the Lord is wisdom, for His declarations stand when everything else crumbles (<a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/11-21.htm">Ezekiel 11:21</a> draws a sharp line: a heart that delights in sin will reap the very ruin it chases. God, whose word is unbreakable, ensures that rebellion boomerangs back on the rebel. He diagnoses the root (the heart), warns of the result (self-inflicted judgment), and seals it with His own authority. The wise respond by turning from detestable pursuits and aligning their hearts with the Lord, whose declarations always come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">I will recompense their way.</span>--In striking contrast to the mercy granted to the repentant, is set forth here, as in <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>, the Divine wrath upon the impenitent. It has never been promised that all men shall be brought to a true sense of their relations to God, for human responsibility, and consequently power of choice, is not removed; but God's grace is never in vain, and if it does not lead to blessing through its acceptance, must result in greater condemnation through its rejection.

And who is sufficient for these things?">2Corinthians 2:16</a>.)<p>The heart of their detestable things, is a figurative expression. Idols in themselves are inanimate things, but the heart of the people was so given to the spirit of idolatry and alienation from God, that the abstract, as usual with this prophet, is represented in this concrete, figurative form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as for them</span>, etc. We note the peculiar phraseology. The <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> of the people walks not simply after <span class="cmt_word">their detestable things</span>, but after the <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> of those things. There is, as it were, a central unity in the evil to which they unite themselves, just as the heart of man turns to the heart of God when the two are in their ideal relation to each other. For those who did this, whether in Jerusalem or among the exiles, there was the prospect of a righteous retribution. The words close the message which Ezekiel heard in the courts of the temple in his visions, but which he was to deliver (ver. 25) to them of the Captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/11-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But as for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
