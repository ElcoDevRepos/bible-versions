Sheba is often associated with the kingdom of the Queen of Sheba, who visited Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-13</a>). Dedan is mentioned in several biblical passages (<a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>) and was known for its trade routes. These regions were known for their wealth and trade, suggesting a connection to commerce and material prosperity.<p><b>and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages</b><br>Tarshish is often identified with a distant maritime location, possibly in the western Mediterranean, such as Spain. It was known for its ships and trade (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>). The mention of "all its villages" implies a network of trading communities. This phrase highlights the commercial interests and the economic implications of the events described.<p><b>will ask, &#8216;Have you come to capture the plunder?</b><br>The question posed by Sheba, Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish suggests a concern for economic stability and the protection of wealth. The term "plunder" indicates a focus on material gain and the threat of invasion or conflict disrupting trade and prosperity.<p><b>Have you assembled your hordes to carry away loot,</b><br>The assembling of "hordes" implies a large, organized military force. This phrase suggests a premeditated plan to seize wealth, reflecting the aggressive nature of the invaders. The term "loot" reinforces the idea of taking valuable goods by force.<p><b>to make off with silver and gold,</b><br>Silver and gold are often symbols of wealth and prosperity in the Bible. Their mention here underscores the material motivations behind the invasion. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the transient nature of earthly riches (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>to take cattle and goods,</b><br>Cattle and goods represent not only wealth but also sustenance and economic resources. The taking of these items would have significant implications for the livelihoods of those affected, indicating a comprehensive plundering of resources.<p><b>to seize great spoil?&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "great spoil" emphasizes the extent and value of the resources targeted by the invaders. This reflects the magnitude of the threat and the potential impact on the affected regions. The concept of "spoil" is often associated with the aftermath of battle, highlighting the destructive consequences of conflict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba_and_dedan.htm">Sheba and Dedan</a></b><br>These are ancient regions often associated with trade and wealth.

In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a> they stand outside Gog&#8217;s invading alliance. Reading the prophecy literally, these Gulf-region nations remain politically separate when Gog advances. Instead of joining the attack, they raise a voice of concern&#8212;suggesting a posture of cautious neutrality that fits their historic role as trading hubs rather than military powers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the merchants of Tarshish</b><p>Tarshish was a renowned maritime trading center (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a> links Tarshish to global commerce, and <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> pictures its merchants delivering tribute. In 38:13 these merchants symbolize seafaring, wealth-oriented nations to the far west of Israel. Taking the text at face value, Ezekiel foresees powerful commercial states&#8212;likely modern successors of that ancient trading empire&#8212;remaining outside Gog&#8217;s coalition yet deeply interested in the economic implications of the invasion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all its villages</b><p>BSB renders the phrase &#8220;with all its villages,&#8221; while many translations say &#8220;young lions.&#8221; Either way, the thought is of Tarshish&#8217;s dependent communities&#8212;colonies, territories, or partner states that share its commercial spirit (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2</a>). The picture is of a network of younger, vigorous offshoots aligned with the parent maritime power, watching events with their own economic security in mind.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will ask</b><p>Rather than intervening militarily, these observers raise a diplomatic query. The Hebrew imperfect form (captured by &#8220;will ask&#8221;) conveys a simple, direct question, hinting at a limited response: diplomatic protest but no force. This resonates with other prophetic scenes where onlookers question an aggressor&#8217;s motives yet hold back from action (<a href="/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have you come to capture the plunder? Have you assembled your hordes to carry away loot, to make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?&#8221;</b><p>The wording mirrors the plunder list of the previous verse (<a href="/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>) and recalls earlier judgments where armies coveted Israel&#8217;s riches (<a href="/zechariah/14-1.htm">Zechariah 14:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>). The focus is strictly material&#8212;silver, gold, livestock, and goods&#8212;underscoring Gog&#8217;s greedy motive. By highlighting economic gain, the question exposes the moral bankruptcy of the invasion and contrasts it with God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness to protect His land (<a href="/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18&#8211;23</a>; 39:6&#8211;7).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a> shows a coalition of trading nations&#8212;Arabian (Sheba and Dedan) and western maritime (Tarshish with its villages)&#8212;standing on the sidelines of Gog&#8217;s assault. They issue a mild, profit-centered protest, revealing that while they value commerce and stability, they lack the resolve to oppose Gog militarily. Their question highlights the invader&#8217;s materialistic intent and sets the stage for God&#8217;s dramatic defense of Israel, proving once more that He alone is Israel&#8217;s ultimate protector and that His prophetic word is exact, literal, and sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Sheba, and Dedan . . . .

All are depicted as following in the wake of Gog, like vultures in the rear of an army, and as inquiring whether Gog had come simply for the purpose of destruction or in the hope of trading with the booty he should capture. In this case they intimate their wish to be partakers of the spoil This (Plumptre), rather than the thirst for booty which characterized them (Keil), their question to Gog signified; Schroder's idea, that they purposed ironically to ridicule the smallness of the spoil which would reward so gigantic an expedition, has as little to recommend it as Kliefoth's suggestion, that they designed to intimate their sympathy with Gog's invasion of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sheba</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1441;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7614.htm">Strong's 7614: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sheba -- a territory in soutwest Arabia, also the name of one or more descendant of Noah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Dedan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1440;&#1491;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
