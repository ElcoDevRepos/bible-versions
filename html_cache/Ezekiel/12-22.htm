It is a reminder of his earthly nature in contrast to the divine messages he delivers. The term "Son of Man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His role as the Messiah and His identification with humanity (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel</b><br>Proverbs were common in ancient cultures, serving as a means to convey collective wisdom or sentiment. This particular proverb reflects a skeptical attitude among the Israelites regarding the fulfillment of prophetic visions. The land of Israel, at this time, was experiencing turmoil and uncertainty, with many doubting the words of the prophets due to the delay in their fulfillment. This skepticism is addressed by God through Ezekiel, challenging the people's disbelief and calling them to trust in His timing.<p><b>&#8216;The days go by, and every vision fails&#8217;?</b><br>This phrase captures the cynicism and impatience of the Israelites. They observed the passage of time without seeing the immediate fulfillment of prophecies, leading them to question the validity of the visions. Historically, this reflects a period of waiting and uncertainty, as the people were in exile and struggling with the apparent silence of God. Theologically, it underscores the tension between human impatience and divine timing. This skepticism is countered in other scriptures, such as <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, which assures that the vision will come to pass at the appointed time. The fulfillment of prophecy is ultimately seen in the coming of Christ, who embodies the realization of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
