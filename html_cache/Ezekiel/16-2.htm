It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the prophet's role as a mediator between the divine and the people. This title is also used for Jesus in the New Testament, emphasizing His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>Confront</b><br>The directive to confront indicates a call to deliver a message of judgment and repentance. Prophets were often tasked with delivering difficult truths, and this confrontation is a divine mandate to address sin directly. It reflects the role of a prophet as one who must speak God's truth, regardless of the reception.<p><b>Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is the capital city of Judah and holds significant religious and cultural importance as the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship. Historically, it was the city chosen by God for His dwelling place among His people. The mention of Jerusalem here is symbolic of the entire nation of Israel, representing the spiritual state of the people.<p><b>With her abominations</b><br>Abominations refer to detestable practices, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. In the context of Israel, these abominations included the worship of foreign gods, alliances with pagan nations, and social injustices. The term is used throughout the Old Testament to describe actions that are particularly offensive to God, highlighting the severity of Israel's sin. This confrontation serves as a call to repentance and a warning of impending judgment if the people do not turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

As <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a> notes, humanity is small and fallen, yet God chooses to speak through people.<p>&#8226;&#8194;This humble designation also points ahead to the Lord Jesus, who called Himself &#8220;the Son of Man&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), showing that God delights to work through human vessels to accomplish His purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>confront</b><p>The Lord commands Ezekiel to &#8220;confront&#8221; (or &#8220;make known to&#8221;) Jerusalem, calling for fearless proclamation.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Ezekiel must lay out sin plainly, not skirt around it (<a href="/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Public rebuke, though uncomfortable, is an act of mercy; &#8220;Better an open rebuke than hidden love&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Prophetic confrontation aims at repentance, just as Nathan&#8217;s direct words led David to confession (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-13</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;God repeats this directive later: &#8220;Son of man, confront Oholah and Oholibah and declare their abominations to them&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/23-36.htm">Ezekiel 23:36</a>), showing consistency in His method.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jerusalem</b><p>The focus narrows from the dispersed nation to its heart&#8212;Jerusalem, the city where God chose to place His Name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Privilege intensifies responsibility; after centuries of covenant grace, the city&#8217;s sin is especially grievous (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Jeremiah wept for this same city, crying, &#8220;How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Jesus later lamented, &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>), showing the tragic continuity of rebellion.<p>&#8226;&#8194;God&#8217;s attention to Jerusalem signals both judgment and hope; while sin is exposed now, future restoration is promised (<a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with her abominations</b><p>&#8220;Abominations&#8221; are detestable practices that violate God&#8217;s holiness and covenant.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Idolatry tops the list&#8212;engraved images on temple walls (<a href="/ezekiel/8-9.htm">Ezekiel 8:9-10</a>) and sacrifices to foreign gods (<a href="/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Moral corruption followed: shedding innocent blood, sexual immorality, and oppression of the poor (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-12</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Such sins are spiritual adultery; they provoke divine jealousy comparable to marital betrayal (<a href="/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;The New Testament echoes the warning: Babylon is described as &#8220;holding a golden cup full of abominations&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4-5</a>), reminding believers that God&#8217;s standard has never changed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2</a> charges the prophet, a mere &#8220;son of man,&#8221; to fearlessly confront privileged Jerusalem with the full list of her abominations. The verse teaches that God lovingly exposes sin so that repentance and restoration may follow. Privilege does not exempt anyone from accountability; rather, it heightens it. Our task today mirrors Ezekiel&#8217;s: speak God&#8217;s truth plainly, trust His Word as wholly accurate, and invite hearts back to covenant faithfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">confront</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1430;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">abominations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8441.htm">Strong's 8441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something disgusting, an abhorrence, idolatry, an idol</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/16-2.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 16:2 Son of man cause Jerusalem to know (Ezek.
