In biblical times, measurement was a way to establish ownership and boundaries, signifying God's sovereignty over the sacred space. The act of measuring is reminiscent of other biblical passages where God delineates sacred spaces, such as in the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-27) and Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 6). It underscores the meticulous nature of God's instructions and the importance of obedience to His design.<p><b>It had a wall all around,</b><br>The presence of a wall signifies protection and separation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, walls were essential for defense and demarcation. Spiritually, walls around sacred spaces symbolize the holiness and purity required to approach God. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12-14</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described with a great, high wall, emphasizing the separation between the holy city and the outside world. The wall serves as a boundary to maintain the sanctity of the area, preventing the profane from entering.<p><b>five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide,</b><br>The specific dimensions highlight the symmetry and perfection in God's design. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient Israel. The equal length and width suggest a square, a shape often associated with completeness and stability. This mirrors the dimensions of the New Jerusalem in <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>, which is also described as a perfect square. The precise measurements reflect God's order and the importance of adhering to His specifications.<p><b>to separate the holy from the common.</b><br>This separation underscores the biblical theme of holiness, which means to be set apart. In <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>, the priests are instructed to distinguish between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean. This concept is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, emphasizing the need for purity and consecration. The wall serves as a physical and symbolic barrier, reminding the Israelites of the distinction between God's sacred presence and the ordinary world. This separation is fulfilled in Christ, who through His sacrifice, makes believers holy and able to approach God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in Ezekiel chapters 40-48 represents a future restoration and the presence of God among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>The wall described in <a href="/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a> serves as a boundary to separate the holy from the common, emphasizing the sanctity of the temple area.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and set apart, just as the temple was separated from the common.
