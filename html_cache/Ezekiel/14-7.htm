This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for all nations, as seen in the Abrahamic promise (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) and the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>). The presence of foreigners in Israel was common due to trade and migration, and they were expected to adhere to certain aspects of the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a>).<p><b>separates himself from Me</b><br>Separation from God indicates a deliberate turning away or apostasy. In the context of Ezekiel, this often involved idolatry and breaking the covenant. The historical backdrop includes Israel's repeated cycles of rebellion and repentance, as seen in the books of Judges and Kings. This separation is not just physical but spiritual, reflecting a heart that has turned away from God, similar to the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>sets up idols in his heart</b><br>Idolatry in the heart suggests an internal, spiritual rebellion rather than just external practices. This internalization of idolatry is significant because it shows that sin begins in the heart (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The prophets frequently condemned idolatry, which was prevalent in the ancient Near East, where various deities were worshipped. This phrase underscores the seriousness of idolatry as a heart issue, not merely a ritualistic one.<p><b>and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face</b><br>A stumbling block refers to anything that leads one into sin or causes spiritual downfall. In biblical terms, it often denotes actions or beliefs that lead others away from God (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>). The imagery suggests an obstacle deliberately placed in one's path, indicating intentional sin. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned not to cause others to stumble (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p><b>and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me</b><br>This action reveals hypocrisy, as the individual seeks divine guidance while harboring idolatry. Prophets in Israel served as God's mouthpieces, delivering His messages to the people. The historical context includes false prophets who misled the people, contrasting with true prophets like Ezekiel who called for repentance. This scenario reflects the tension between genuine and false spirituality.<p><b>I the LORD will answer him Myself</b><br>God's direct response indicates His sovereignty and the seriousness of the offense. In the Old Testament, God often communicated through prophets, but here He promises a personal response, emphasizing accountability. This divine intervention is consistent with God's character as just and righteous, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that God knows the hearts of all people (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The covenant people of God, chosen to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners_residing_in_israel.htm">Foreigners residing in Israel</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who were expected to adhere to certain aspects of the covenant community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_in_the_heart.htm">Idols in the heart</a></b><br>Represents internal idolatry, where individuals prioritize anything above God in their hearts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A messenger of God, through whom God communicates His will to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_heart.htm">Guard Your Heart</a></b><br>The heart is the seat of our affections and priorities.

Israel being a theocracy, its fundamental law against idol-worship could not be violated with impunity by those who sought the protection of its government (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/20-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 20:1-2</a>, &c.). In this case, however, outward idolatry is not alleged, as the accusations of this verse and <a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm" title="Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;">Ezekiel 14:4</a> refer only to the secret idolatry of the heart; and the point insisted upon is not so much the idol-worship in itself, as the hypocrisy of attempting to join with this the enquiring of the Lord. God declares that He will answer such hypocrisy, in whomsoever it may be found, not by the prophet through whom the enquiry is made, but by Himself interposing to punish the enquirer, and to make him an example to deter others from a like course.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The stranger that sojourneth among you.</span> It is noticeable that Ezekiel uses here and elsewhere (<a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22, 23</a>) the familiar phrase of the books which most influenced his teaching (<a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16-25</a>; <a href="/numbers/9.htm">Numbers 9, 15</a>; Deuteronomy <span class="accented">passim</span>).

What it means is that, instead of a spoken answer by the mouth of the prophet, there should be an answer in the discipline of life, in the immediate utterance through the conscience, which was the voice of God. The inquirer who came with unconfessed and unrepented hankerings after the worship of other gods deserved and would receive no other answer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israelite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or any foreigner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1461;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#234;&#183;hag&#183;g&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m, Article &#124;
