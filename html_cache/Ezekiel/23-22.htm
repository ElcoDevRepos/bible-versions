The name means "My tent is in her," symbolizing God's presence in the city. The phrase "this is what the Lord GOD says" emphasizes the divine authority and certainty of the message. In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to His people through the prophet, underscoring the seriousness of the message. This introduction sets the stage for a pronouncement of judgment, a common theme in prophetic literature.<p><b>I will incite your lovers against you,</b><br>The "lovers" refer to the foreign nations with whom Jerusalem (Oholibah) formed alliances, often involving idolatry and political entanglements contrary to God's commands. These alliances were seen as acts of unfaithfulness to God, akin to adultery. The incitement of these nations against Jerusalem is a reversal of fortunes, where those once considered allies become adversaries. This reflects the biblical principle that reliance on worldly powers rather than God leads to downfall (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><b>those from whom you turned away in disgust.</b><br>This phrase indicates a history of broken alliances and failed relationships. Jerusalem's turning away "in disgust" suggests a rejection or betrayal of these nations after using them for political gain. Historically, Judah often vacillated between alliances with Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, leading to instability and eventual judgment. This turning away also symbolizes the spiritual adultery of abandoning God for idols, only to later reject those idols when they proved untrustworthy.<p><b>And I will bring them against you from every side&#8212;</b><br>The comprehensive nature of the impending judgment is highlighted here. The phrase "from every side" suggests a total encirclement and inescapable siege, historically fulfilled in the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. This reflects the Deuteronomic curses for covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>). Theologically, it underscores the inevitability of divine judgment when God's people persist in sin. The imagery of being surrounded also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and need for redemption, pointing to the necessity of a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah</a></b><br>A symbolic name representing the southern kingdom of Judah.
