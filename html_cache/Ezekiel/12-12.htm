The timing "at dusk" suggests an attempt to escape under the cover of darkness, symbolizing desperation and the futility of human plans against divine judgment. The act of lifting bags to his shoulder indicates preparation for a journey, highlighting the urgency and secrecy of the escape. Historically, this aligns with the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, where Zedekiah attempted to flee the city. Theologically, this act of fleeing can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy and a demonstration of the consequences of disobedience to God.<p><b>They will dig through the wall to bring him out.</b><br>The phrase "dig through the wall" suggests a clandestine escape route, indicating the dire circumstances within the besieged city. This action reflects the desperation of the leadership and the breakdown of societal order. Archaeologically, evidence of breaches in city walls from this period supports the historical context of sieges. Biblically, this act is a literal fulfillment of Ezekiel's earlier symbolic actions (<a href="/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>), where he was instructed to dig through a wall as a sign to the people. This connection emphasizes the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's ministry and the certainty of God's word.<p><b>He will cover his face so he cannot see the land.</b><br>Covering the face signifies shame and mourning, as well as an attempt to hide one's identity. In the context of Zedekiah, it also foreshadows his eventual capture and blinding by the Babylonians (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>), fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy (<a href="/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>). The inability to see the land symbolizes the loss of his kingdom and the severing of his connection to the land of Judah. This act serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God and the fulfillment of divine judgment. In a typological sense, it contrasts with Jesus Christ, who, though He faced suffering and shame, did so willingly and with the purpose of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is delivering a message of judgment and symbolic actions to the exiles in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>Refers to Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, who attempted to escape the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under siege by the Babylonians, representing the center of Jewish life and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_siege.htm">Babylonian Siege</a></b><br>The historical event where Babylon besieged Jerusalem, leading to its eventual fall and the exile of its people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive to Babylon, a significant event in Jewish history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Zedekiah's actions illustrate the severe consequences of disobedience to God's commands and breaking covenants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_plans_against_god's_will.htm">The Futility of Human Plans Against God's Will</a></b><br>Despite Zedekiah's efforts to escape, God's will prevailed, showing the futility of human plans against divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_vision.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Vision</a></b><br>Zedekiah covering his face symbolizes spiritual blindness.

Ezekiel sees him slipping out of Jerusalem as darkness falls.<p>&#8226; Timing matters. &#8220;At dusk&#8221; evokes secrecy and fear, just as <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a> says men &#8220;loved darkness rather than light.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The baggage shows Zedekiah believes he can preserve his life and possessions, yet Jesus warns, &#8220;What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophecy was fulfilled literally when, during the Babylonian siege, Zedekiah fled by night through a gate between two walls (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already said, &#8220;He shall not escape from his hand&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), proving the futility of plans that ignore His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will dig through the wall to bring him out</b><p>Ezekiel pictures captives tunneling through a breach.<p>&#8226; Digging highlights desperation. Instead of trusting God, Zedekiah &#8220;stiffened his neck and hardened his heart&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>).<p>&#8226; It also exposes hidden sin. <a href="/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a> echoes, &#8220;Though they dig into Sheol, from there My hand will take them.&#8221; No wall, tunnel, or clever scheme can keep divine judgment at bay.<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;they&#8221; points to his officials who followed him (<a href="/jeremiah/52-8.htm">Jeremiah 52:8</a>). Leaders who reject God often drag others with them into ruin.<p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s army &#8220;overtook the king&#8221; in the plains of Jericho (<a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>).

Disobedience produces guilt that can&#8217;t be masked by a cloak.<p>&#8226; Ironically, Ezekiel foretells more than a disguise: after capture, &#8220;They put out Zedekiah&#8217;s eyes&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). He literally never saw the land of Judah again, living blind in Babylon until death (<a href="/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores a solemn truth: persistent unbelief darkens spiritual sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Zedekiah shut his eyes to God, and physical blindness followed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm">Ezekiel 12:12</a> is a precise, literal prophecy of King Zedekiah&#8217;s midnight escape attempt during Jerusalem&#8217;s fall. It speaks of:<p>&#8226; a covert flight at dusk with meager belongings,<p>&#8226; a desperate breach through the city wall, and<p>&#8226; a face hidden in shame that foreshadows permanent blindness in exile.<p>Every detail came to pass (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>; <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39</a>), confirming that God&#8217;s word never fails. The verse warns that no human scheme can evade divine judgment, yet it also reassures believers that the LORD governs history down to the smallest event, and His promises&#8212;both of discipline and of salvation&#8212;are absolutely certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They shall dig through the wall.</span>--This circumstance is not mentioned in the history of Zedekiah's flight; yet it is not necessary to understand it figuratively, since such a breach in the walls at a place unwatched by the enemy might easily be arranged to secure secrecy, and as easily be passed over in the brevity of the historical account.
