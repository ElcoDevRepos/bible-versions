The metaphor of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God, particularly in their idolatry and alliances with foreign nations. Despite being chosen and set apart by God, Israel pursued other gods and political alliances, which is likened to marital infidelity. This imagery is consistent with the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God is the faithful husband and Israel is the unfaithful wife. The use of "while she was still Mine" emphasizes that Israel's unfaithfulness occurred despite their covenant relationship with God, highlighting the gravity of their betrayal.<p><b>She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians&#8212;warriors</b><br>The "lovers" here refer to the Assyrians, a powerful empire known for their military prowess and expansionist policies during the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Israel's political and military alliances with Assyria are depicted as acts of infidelity to God. Historically, Israel sought Assyrian support against other regional threats, which often involved adopting Assyrian religious practices and paying tribute, further leading them away from their covenant with God. The term "warriors" underscores the might and allure of Assyria's military strength, which Israel found enticing. This pursuit of foreign alliances is condemned by the prophets, as it demonstrated a lack of trust in God's protection and provision. The broader biblical narrative consistently warns against reliance on human power rather than divine support, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, which cautions against seeking help from Egypt instead of trusting in the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah.htm">Oholah</a></b><br>Represents Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The nearness here spoken of is to be understood not locally, but spiritually, of sympathy in idolatry. Of the earlier connection between Israel and Assyria there is little remaining record. In <a href="/context/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19-20</a>, it is said that Pul exacted tribute of Menahem, and the mention seems to imply a still earlier intercourse.
