In Ezekiel's vision, they are depicted as having wings, which symbolize their swiftness and divine mission. The sound of their wings signifies the power and majesty of God's presence. In biblical context, cherubim are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life, indicating their role as protectors of divine holiness.<p><b>could be heard as far as the outer court</b><br>The outer court refers to the area surrounding the temple, accessible to all people, including Gentiles. The fact that the sound reaches this far emphasizes the magnitude and authority of God's presence. It suggests that God's actions and messages are not confined to the innermost sanctuaries but extend to all who are willing to listen. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament message that God's salvation is available to all nations.<p><b>like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks</b><br>The comparison to the voice of God Almighty underscores the authority and power of the sound. In the Old Testament, God's voice is often associated with thunder and overwhelming power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. This phrase highlights the divine nature of the vision and the seriousness of the message being conveyed.

Their wings are not symbolic only; Ezekiel actually hears them, underscoring that heaven&#8217;s court is alive and active even when Judah&#8217;s earthly temple is failing.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> the seraphim cover their faces and feet with wings; here the cherubim&#8217;s wings ring out, stressing holiness and power.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> describes the LORD &#8220;soaring on the wings of the wind,&#8221; showing that heavenly movement often accompanies divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>could be heard as far as the outer court</b><p>The volume carries &#8220;as far as the outer court,&#8221; a literal measure of distance in Solomon&#8217;s temple (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>).

They were now just on the eve of going away, and the movement was a great one, so that the sound was "heard even to the outer court" Throughout this chapter the s in cherubims is quite unnecessary, since cherubim is already the Hebrew plural of cherub.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/10-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a> are not subsequent in time to <a href="/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>, but are simply a more particular account, given parenthetically, of what had already been briefly mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/10-8.htm" title="And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.">Ezekiel 10:8-17</a> are largely a repetition of the description of the vision in Ezekiel 1, but it is here given in parts, parenthetically, in connection with the progress of the narrative. The course of the narrative itself is as follows :--After the man in linen has gone out (<a href="/ezekiel/10-7.htm" title="And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.">Ezekiel 10:7</a>), a command is issued, "O wheel." They were to set themselves in motion. Then (<a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>) they "were lifted up," and (<a href="/context/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>) "the glory of the Lord departed" from the Temple, and "mounted up from the earth." The repetition of the description of Ezekiel 1 is by no means accidental, but serves partly to connect the various particulars with the course of the symbolic narrative, and mainly to emphasize the identity of the glory departing from the Temple with the Divine glory before seen. There are, however, several variations from the former description. Particularly in <a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a> (as in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>) there is mention of the abundance of eyes, a symbol of vigilance and activity, covering the whole body of the cherubim and the wheels. In <a href="/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14</a>, after saying that "every one had four faces," as in Ezekiel 1, the particular faces are described, but with this important variation :--the first is said to be "the face of a cherub," instead of "the face of an ox," as in Ezekiel 1; more exactly it is "the face of <span class= "ital">the </span>cherub," since the Hebrew has the definite article. The reason of this variation and the meaning of "the face of the cherub" are both obscure. In <a href="/ezekiel/10-22.htm" title="And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.">Ezekiel 10:22</a> it is expressly said that their faces were the same as those seen by the Chebar; and again, in <a href="/context/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15-20</a>, the whole vision is described as the "living creature" seen by the Chebar. It is plain, therefore, that the variation is only in the description, and not in the thing described. The most natural solution of the difficulty in the text as it stands is that a cherub was ordinarily represented with the face of an ox. But there is no evidence of this, and it is not impossible that a slight error may have been introduced into the text. The Greek version did not contain the verse in the time of St. Jerome, and in its Roman form does not now. It was introduced into the Alexandrian copies from the later version of Theodotion, and Theodoret does not recognise it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sound of the cherubim.</span> The use of <span class="cmt_word">God Almighty</span> (<span class="accented">El Shaddai</span>; comp. <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>), the name of God as ruling over nature, while Jehovah expressed his covenant relationship to Israel, is, it may be noted, characteristic of the early stage of the religion of Israel (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-3.htm">Genesis 48:3</a>). <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> alone appears eighty-one times in the Book of Job. <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. explains the voice of El Shaddai (though there it is "the voice of Jehovah") as meaning the roar of the thunder.
