These rooms symbolize the provision and orderliness of God's house. In the broader context of Ezekiel's vision, these chambers emphasize the holiness and separation required in worship. The temple's design reflects God's meticulous nature and His desire for a structured approach to worship, reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the Tabernacle in Exodus.<p><b>with one entrance on the north and another on the south</b><br>The entrances on the north and south sides suggest accessibility and symmetry in the temple's design. This layout may symbolize the inclusivity of God's invitation to worship, open to all directions, yet still maintaining order. The north and south entrances could also reflect the geographical orientation of the temple, aligning with the cardinal directions, which was common in ancient Near Eastern architecture. This design choice underscores the universality of God's presence and the invitation to all nations, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, where God's house is called a house of prayer for all peoples.<p><b>The open area was five cubits wide all around</b><br>The open area, or the space surrounding the temple, being five cubits wide, indicates a buffer zone of separation, emphasizing the sanctity of the temple itself. The number five in biblical numerology often represents grace, suggesting that this space is a gracious provision for maintaining holiness. This separation can be seen as a type of the separation between the holy and the common, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the Levitical laws.

The wall, 6 cubits; the chambers, 4; their outer wall, 5; the platform beyond, 5; the space beyond this, 20 (6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 20 = 40). This was on each side, and therefore is to be doubled, making 80 cubits; to this add the 20 cubits of the inner width of the Temple, and we have exactly the 100 cubits, the width of the inner court. In the same way the length: here the porch is considered as belonging to the court, and with it the front wall of the Temple, the thickness of which is included in the length of the porch. Beginning then at the inside of the outer walls, we have the inner length of Temple, 60 cubits; rear wall, 6; chambers, 4; outer wall, 5; platform, 5; space, 20; in all, 100 cubits. thus making an exact square.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The place that was left</span> has been differently explained (see above on ver. 9); but on any hypothesis the side chambers opened on the free space towards the north and towards the south, g.s. one row of chambers was entered by a door from the south, another by a door from the north.
