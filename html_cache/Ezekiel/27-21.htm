The mention of "princes of Kedar" highlights a specific tribe within Arabia, known for their wealth and influence. Kedar, a descendant of Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>), was renowned for its flocks and tents (<a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16-17</a>). This phrase indicates the extensive trade network of Tyre, a powerful maritime city, which engaged with distant lands. The relationship between Tyre and Kedar underscores the economic interdependence of ancient civilizations and reflects the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the wealth and influence of Ishmael's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p><b>trading in lambs, rams, and goats</b><br>The trade in livestock such as lambs, rams, and goats was a significant aspect of the economy in the ancient Near East. These animals were not only valuable for their meat, milk, and wool but also played a crucial role in religious sacrifices and offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10, 3</a>:12). The exchange of livestock between Tyre and Kedar illustrates the mutual benefits of trade, where Tyre's demand for sacrificial animals and Kedar's supply of livestock created a thriving market. This trade also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision through creation, as seen in the abundance of resources available for both sustenance and worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arabia.htm">Arabia</a></b><br>A region in the ancient Near East, often associated with the nomadic tribes and trading routes.

The Phoenician port drew resources even from the open sands, fulfilling God&#8217;s word that &#8220;the wealth of the nations will come&#8221; to the power centers He allows for a season (<a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>).<p>&#8211; The reference also exposes how deeply entwined economic ties had become. While Israel was called to depend on the Lord, Tyre placed confidence in profits pouring in from every direction (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the princes of Kedar</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Kedar&#8221; traces back to Ishmael&#8217;s second son (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>). These clans became famous for tents of black goats&#8217; hair (Song of Songs 1:5) and for supplying flocks to neighboring peoples.<p>&#8211; By mentioning &#8220;all the princes,&#8221; Ezekiel underlines that every chieftain in Kedar found Tyre too lucrative to ignore. The whole tribe&#8217;s leadership aligned itself with the seaport&#8217;s trade network.<p>&#8211; Other prophets speak of Kedar&#8217;s dominance in livestock and archery (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28&#8211;29</a>), showing why Tyre prized them as partners. The verse quietly contrasts Kedar&#8217;s nomadic life with Tyre&#8217;s urban sophistication&#8212;yet both rely on worldly commerce and are vulnerable when God judges pride (<a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were your customers</b><p>&#8211; The phrase reveals Tyre&#8217;s role as a marketplace magnet. Nations lined up as &#8220;customers,&#8221; a term Ezekiel repeats throughout this chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12, 15, 17</a>).<p>&#8211; The repeated emphasis echoes <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>: &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall.&#8221; Tyre&#8217;s identity had become synonymous with buying and selling, not with righteousness.<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a> picks up the same vocabulary when describing end-times Babylon. Ezekiel thus provides a historical preview of how God will eventually topple every economy that displaces Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Trading in lambs, rams, and goats</b><p>&#8211; The goods listed&#8212;&#8220;lambs, rams, and goats&#8221;&#8212;were staples of Kedar&#8217;s herds. They were also animals prescribed for sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Tyre coveted them for meat, wool, hides, and perhaps to resell to temple markets around the Mediterranean. Yet while commerce moved the animals, only Israel was commanded to present them as offerings pointing to the coming Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> foresees a day when flocks from Kedar will be brought &#8220;to adorn My glorious house.&#8221; What Kedar once sold to Tyre will one day honor the Lord alone&#8212;an encouraging glimpse of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a> details how Arabia and every leader of Kedar eagerly supplied Tyre with valuable livestock. The verse spotlights Tyre&#8217;s far-flung trading web, Kedar&#8217;s prominence in pastoral wealth, and the allure of profit that bound desert nomads to a bustling coastal city. While Tyre gloried in commerce, the passage hints that true glory belongs to God, who will ultimately redirect even Kedar&#8217;s flocks for His worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Arabia . . .
