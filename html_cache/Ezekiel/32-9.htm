The troubling of hearts suggests a widespread impact beyond the immediate context, reflecting God's sovereignty over nations. This echoes the fear that fell upon nations during other divine judgments, such as the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14-16</a>). The phrase also highlights the universal recognition of God's power, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>, where God is asked to instill fear in the nations.<p><b>when I bring about your destruction among the nations</b><br>The destruction mentioned here refers to the downfall of Egypt, a significant power in the ancient Near East. This event is part of a series of prophecies against Egypt (Ezekiel 29-32), emphasizing God's control over empires. Historically, Egypt's fall would have been a monumental event, affecting trade and political alliances. The phrase underscores the theme of divine retribution, as seen in the fall of other nations like Babylon (Isaiah 13) and Assyria (Nahum 3).<p><b>in countries you do not know</b><br>This suggests the far-reaching consequences of Egypt's destruction, affecting regions unfamiliar to them. It implies that the impact of God's judgment transcends geographical boundaries, aligning with the biblical theme of God's universal dominion (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). The phrase also hints at the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations, where the fall of one power could ripple across distant lands, as seen in the spread of news and influence in the ancient world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
