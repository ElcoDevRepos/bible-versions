The term "My flock" indicates God's ownership and care for His people, often symbolized as sheep in biblical literature. This imagery is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd. The use of "flock" also highlights the communal aspect of God's people, suggesting a collective responsibility and identity.<p><b>I will judge between one sheep and another:</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine judgment that is discerning and specific. The judgment is not just between the righteous and the wicked but also among those who are part of the community of believers. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s intimate knowledge of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>, where Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me." The judgment among the sheep suggests accountability within the community of faith.<p><b>between the rams and the goats:</b><br>The distinction between "rams" and "goats" symbolizes different types of individuals within the community. Rams, being mature male sheep, may represent leaders or those with authority, while goats often symbolize those who are rebellious or wayward, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where Jesus separates the sheep from the goats based on their actions. This imagery underscores the idea that God&#8217;s judgment is based on righteousness and behavior, not merely on outward affiliation with the community. The separation also foreshadows the final judgment, where Christ will distinguish between those who truly follow Him and those who do not.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign ruler and judge, emphasizing His authority and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's people, often representing those who are faithful and obedient.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rams.htm">Rams</a></b><br>Typically represent leaders or those in positions of authority within the flock.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/goats.htm">Goats</a></b><br>Often symbolize those who are rebellious or disobedient among God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event where God distinguishes between the faithful and the unfaithful within His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_judgment.htm">God's Sovereign Judgment</a></b><br>God is the ultimate judge who discerns the hearts and actions of His people.

The Lord promises to vindicate the weak (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>).<p>- This judgment occurs &#8220;between,&#8221; not merely &#8220;over,&#8221; the sheep, highlighting perfect discernment (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>- For Israel, it pointed to the future purging and restoration of the nation (<a href="/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35-38</a>). For all believers, it foreshadows Christ&#8217;s evaluative seat where rewards are given and motives exposed (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>).<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Spiritual community requires humility and care for the vulnerable (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; True faith shows itself in conduct; the Shepherd&#8217;s scrutiny motivates holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>between the rams and the goats</b><p>- &#8220;Rams&#8221; symbolize the strong, domineering members of the flock who pushed with side and shoulder (<a href="/ezekiel/34-21.htm">Ezekiel 34:21</a>). &#8220;Goats&#8221; often picture stubborn independence (<a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>).<p>- The separation imagery anticipates the scene Jesus describes: &#8220;He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s standard is righteous, not arbitrary; He honors those who reflect His character and confronts those who corrupt community (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p>- Ultimately this points to the Messianic reign when David&#8217;s greater Son rules with justice (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>- Implications for today:<p>&#8226; Strength used selfishly invites the Shepherd&#8217;s corrective rod (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord defends the oppressed and insists that leadership be servant-hearted (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17</a> is God&#8217;s solemn promise to act as both Shepherd and Judge.

The verse calls every believer to trust His oversight, walk in compassionate integrity, and remember that the Shepherd&#8217;s righteous judgment is sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Between cattle and cattle.--</span>In other words, <span class= "ital">between one and another of the flock.</span> They are not all alike to be saved and blessed, but only those who turn in penitence and submission to God, their Shepherd. The same contrast is again expressed in <a href="/ezekiel/34-20.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD to them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.">Ezekiel 34:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-22.htm" title="Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.">Ezekiel 34:22</a>. It is not between "the cattle" on the one side, and "the rams and the he-goats" on the other, but between the cattle themselves, and also between the rams and he-goats themselves; all the evil, of whatever class, are to be rejected. <a href="/context/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18-19</a> are addressed to those who will be rejected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle</span>. It may be worth while to note, as modern English usage tends to limit the range of the word, that it is commonly used in the Old Testament of sheep rather than of kine (<a href="/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34-42</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-8.htm">Genesis 31:8-12</a>). In <a href="/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a> we have the same Hebrew word as that which Ezekiel uses. <span class="cmt_word">Between the rams and the he-goats</span>. The words, at first, seem to point to a division like that of <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>, and may, perhaps, have suggested it. Here, however, the contrast lies, not between the sheep and goats as such, but between the strong and the weak of each class. The "rams" are as much the object of the shepherd's discipline of judgment as the "he-goats." Both stand as the representative of the rapacious self-seeking classes who oppressed the poor and needy, and, not content with being the first to feed on the pastures and to drink of the waters, trampled on the former and defiled the latter. So in the next verse the contrast lies between the "fat cattle," whether sheep or goats, and the "lean." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#234;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
