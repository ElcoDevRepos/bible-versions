In Ezekiel's vision, this prince is not a king but a leader with specific roles in worship. A "freewill offering" is a voluntary act of worship, reflecting the heart's desire to honor God beyond obligatory sacrifices. This offering signifies devotion and gratitude, aligning with the broader biblical theme of giving willingly to God (<a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>).<p><b>whether a burnt offering or a peace offering</b><br>Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God (Leviticus 1). Peace offerings, on the other hand, were shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer, symbolizing fellowship with God (Leviticus 3). These offerings highlight different aspects of worship: complete surrender and communal fellowship. The prince's offerings reflect his role in leading the people in both dedication and community with God.<p><b>the gate facing east must be opened for him</b><br>The east gate holds significant symbolism, as it faces the direction of the rising sun, often associated with God's glory and presence (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>). Opening the gate for the prince signifies access to God's presence, a privilege granted for worship. This act underscores the importance of proper worship and the reverence due to God.<p><b>He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest and worship, a covenant sign between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). Offering sacrifices on the Sabbath emphasizes the continuity of worship and the prince's role in maintaining spiritual order. It reflects the regularity and consistency expected in worship practices, ensuring that offerings are made with the same reverence and procedure as on holy days.<p><b>Then he shall go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out</b><br>The closing of the gate after the prince exits signifies the completion of the worship act. It maintains the sanctity of the space, ensuring that access to God's presence is regulated and respected. This practice highlights the order and structure within the temple worship, reflecting God's holiness and the need for reverence in approaching Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler in Israel, often seen as a representative of the people in worship and offerings.

the gate facing east must be opened for him.&#8221; (v. 12c)<p>&#8226;<a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a> states this east gate is normally shut, having been sanctified by the glory of the LORD; it opens only for special occasions.<p>&#8226;Its opening underscores privileged access yet strict holiness: the prince approaches God on God&#8217;s terms, not his own (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226;The eastward orientation recalls the return of the Lord&#8217;s glory from the east (<a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>), hinting at Messiah&#8217;s presence and the dawning of a new day (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day</b><p>&#8220;He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day.&#8221; (v. 12d)<p>&#8226;Earlier in the chapter the Sabbath pattern is detailed: six lambs and a ram for a burnt offering, plus grain and oil (<a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226;The prince follows the same order even when the occasion is voluntary, teaching that heartfelt worship still respects God&#8217;s prescribed ways (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a>).<p>&#8226;Sabbath procedures ensure reverence, balance freedom with form, and keep worship centered on God rather than personal whim (<a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he shall go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out</b><p>&#8220;Then he shall go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out.&#8221; (v. 12e)<p>&#8226;The prince does not linger; once worship is complete he exits, and the gate is shut, preserving its sanctity (<a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226;This closure highlights that access is a privilege, not a perpetual right, guarding against casual familiarity with holy things (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226;It also anticipates the day when the true Prince, Jesus, will enter once for all and no further sacrifice will be needed (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-12.htm">Ezekiel 46:12</a> paints a literal future scene where the Davidic prince brings a voluntary burnt or peace offering. His willing heart, the prescribed offerings, the temporary opening of the east gate, and the orderly exit all underscore these truths: worship is voluntary yet regulated, leadership submits to God, holiness demands controlled access, and every sacrifice ultimately points to the perfect work of Christ, our Prince of Peace and complete consecration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">A voluntary burnt offering.</span>--One case in which the prince might present a sacrifice is yet unprovided <span class= "ital">for.</span> He might offer, like any of the people, a voluntary sacrifice at any time, either a burnt offering or a peace offering.
