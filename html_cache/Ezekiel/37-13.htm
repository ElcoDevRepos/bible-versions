The term "My people" reflects the special bond and chosen status of Israel as God's nation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>. It underscores the personal and collective identity of the Israelites as belonging to God, highlighting His commitment to them despite their exile and current state of despair.<p><b>will know that I am the LORD,</b><br>The knowledge of God as LORD (Yahweh) is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing His sovereignty and faithfulness. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, involving recognition of God's power and authority. It connects to the broader biblical narrative where God reveals Himself through acts of deliverance, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence and power (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<p><b>when I open your graves</b><br>The imagery of opening graves signifies a dramatic act of divine intervention and restoration. In the context of Ezekiel, it symbolizes the end of exile and the renewal of Israel as a nation. This metaphor of resurrection prefigures the New Testament understanding of resurrection, as seen in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>, where Jesus speaks of Himself as the resurrection and the life. It also reflects the hope of physical and spiritual renewal.<p><b>and bring you up from them.</b><br>This phrase completes the resurrection imagery, indicating a return to life and restoration. Historically, it points to the return from Babylonian exile, but prophetically, it foreshadows the ultimate resurrection of believers at the end of time (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ's resurrection, which is the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), offering hope of eternal life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
