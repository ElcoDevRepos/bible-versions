The grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were part of the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 2, 4, 5). These offerings were meant to atone for sin and express devotion to God. The priests were allowed to consume portions of these offerings as part of their sustenance, signifying their role as mediators between God and the people. This consumption also symbolized the priests' participation in the holiness and atonement processes. The grain offering, often made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, represented dedication and thanksgiving to God. The sin and guilt offerings were specifically for atonement, highlighting the priests' role in the spiritual cleansing of Israel. This practice foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses these offerings through His atoning death (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<p><b>Everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them.</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle that what is consecrated to God is set apart for His service and, by extension, for those who serve Him. In ancient Israel, items or offerings devoted to the LORD were considered holy and were often given to the priests for their use and sustenance (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-19</a>). This provision ensured that the priests, who had no inheritance of land like the other tribes, were supported by the community they served. The concept of devotion to the LORD implies a total dedication, often involving a vow or a special act of consecration. This principle is seen in the New Testament as well, where believers are called to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The priests' entitlement to these devoted things highlights their unique role and the respect and honor due to those who serve in God's presence. This also points to the ultimate devotion of Christ, who was wholly dedicated to the Father's will, and through whom believers are called to live lives devoted to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his visions and messages concerning the restoration of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levitical_priests.htm">The Levitical Priests</a></b><br>Specifically, the sons of Zadok, who are set apart to serve in the temple and are given specific duties and privileges, including consuming certain offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for Israel, representing God's presence among His people and the focal point of the sacrificial system.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings.htm">Offerings</a></b><br>The grain, sin, and guilt offerings are part of the sacrificial system, each with specific purposes related to worship, atonement, and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, whose religious practices and covenant relationship with God are central to the context of this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_provision.htm">Priestly Provision</a></b><br>The provision for the priests through offerings underscores God's care for those who serve Him.

These offerings, made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>), were presented as acts of thanksgiving and dedication.<p>&#8226; Because the grain offering was &#8220;most holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), only the priests could consume it, underscoring both the holiness of the gift and God&#8217;s care for His ministers (<a href="/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; In the exile Ezekiel&#8217;s audience lacked a functioning temple; God reassured them that priestly privileges and responsibilities would be restored in His timing (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40-41</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, this clause affirms that the LORD meets the daily physical needs of those who serve Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>), a truth that remains unchanged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings</b><p>Sin offerings (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>) and guilt offerings (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14&#8211;6</a>:7) addressed specific acts of disobedience and provided atonement. God designates portions of these sacrifices for the priests (<a href="/leviticus/6-24.htm">Leviticus 6:24-29</a>; 7:7).<p>&#8226; By eating what had been offered for sin, the priests participated in the worshiper&#8217;s restoration, symbolizing their mediating role (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s vision looks ahead to a renewed temple order where blood sacrifices memorialize Christ&#8217;s ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-14</a>) while literally fulfilling covenant promises to Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause highlights both God&#8217;s justice&#8212;sin must be addressed&#8212;and His mercy&#8212;He provides a way of forgiveness (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them</b><p>&#8220;Devoted&#8221; (&#7717;erem) refers to items set apart exclusively for God&#8212;whether spoils, land, or gifts (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>). In Ezekiel&#8217;s future temple, such things become the rightful property of the priests.<p>&#8226; This distribution upholds the principle that priests inherit the LORD Himself rather than territorial land (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By granting them dedicated items, God tangibly provides for their livelihood, freeing them to focus on worship and teaching (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrangement also safeguards holiness: objects consecrated to God remain within sacred service rather than returning to common use (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> promises that faithful priests will receive every holy portion&#8212;grain, sin, guilt offerings, and all things devoted to God&#8212;as their provision. Literally fulfilled in Israel&#8217;s future temple, the verse underscores God&#8217;s unchanging pattern: He supplies those who serve Him, maintains clear distinctions between holy and common, and ensures that worship centers on atonement and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - To the priests should be allocated, in addition, what already had been assigned them by the Law for their support, the meat (or, meal) <span class="cmt_word">offering</span>, consisting of flour, corn, or bread (comp. <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-12.htm">Numbers 28:12, 13</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the sin offering</span> (see <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25-29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9, 10</a>), and the trespass (or, <span class="accented">guilt</span>) offering (comp. <a href="/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28-38</a>), and every dedicated (or, <span class="accented">devoted</span>) thing in Israel (see <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>). The burnt offering is omitted, because it was entirely consumed upon the altar, with the exception of the hide or skin, which under the Law became a perquisite of the officiating priest (<a href="/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). That Ezekiel is silent about this, while the requirement of <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>, that the priest should obtain the breast with the right shoulder of every fire offering, goes beyond the prescription of <a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>, that the shoulder, two cheeks, and the maw should be the priest's portion, is regarded by Wellhausen and Smend as a proof that Ezekiel stands between Deuteronomy and the priest-code. But as Ezekiel does not condescend upon the particular parts which should be reserved from the fire offerings, it is impossible to say whether he held with the Deuteronomist or the writer of the priest-code, supposing them to be different; and, inasmuch as <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> speaks of an offerings, by fire that was first paid to Jehovah and by him afterwards handed over to Aaron and his sons, while <a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a> treats of the dues which should be paid by the people directly to the priests, it is clear that both practices may have existed together instead of the one (the former) coming in as an advance upon the other (the latter);
