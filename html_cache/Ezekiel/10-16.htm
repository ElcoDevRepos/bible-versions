In Ezekiel's vision, they symbolize God's divine presence and His active involvement in the affairs of Israel. The movement of the cherubim signifies God's dynamic and sovereign action in the world. This imagery is consistent with other biblical depictions of cherubim, such as in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life, and in <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, where they are part of the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant.<p><b>the wheels moved beside them</b><br>The wheels are part of the complex vision of God's chariot-throne, representing His omnipresence and omniscience. The wheels moving in unison with the cherubim suggest the perfect harmony and coordination in God's actions. This imagery emphasizes that God's plans and purposes are executed with precision and are not random or chaotic. The wheels' movement alongside the cherubim also reflects the interconnectedness of God's creation and His governance over it.<p><b>and even when they spread their wings to rise from the ground</b><br>The spreading of wings indicates readiness for action and the ability to transcend earthly limitations. This action symbolizes God's transcendence and His ability to operate beyond human constraints. The rising from the ground signifies a departure from the earthly realm, highlighting the divine nature of the vision and the heavenly origin of God's authority and power. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where wings symbolize protection and divine intervention, such as in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>.<p><b>the wheels did not veer away from their side</b><br>The unwavering position of the wheels signifies the steadfastness and reliability of God's presence and guidance. It underscores the idea that God's purposes are unchanging and His plans are executed with unwavering precision. This consistency is a reassurance of God's faithfulness and His unchanging nature, as echoed in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, where God declares, "For I the Lord do not change." The imagery of the wheels remaining beside the cherubim also emphasizes the unity and coherence of God's actions and His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>These are angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.
