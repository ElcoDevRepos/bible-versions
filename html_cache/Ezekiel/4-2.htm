This act is a prophetic sign to the exiles in Babylon, illustrating the impending judgment on Jerusalem. The siege symbolizes God's wrath due to the people's persistent idolatry and disobedience. The use of a siege in prophecy underscores the severity of the coming destruction, as sieges were brutal and often led to famine and suffering.<p><b>Construct a siege wall:</b><br>A siege wall was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, used to encircle a city and cut off supplies. This imagery would have been familiar to Ezekiel's audience, as they had witnessed or heard of such tactics used by powerful empires like Assyria and Babylon. The construction of a siege wall signifies the inescapable nature of God's judgment, as the city would be completely surrounded with no means of escape.<p><b>Build a ramp to it:</b><br>Siege ramps were used to breach city walls, allowing attacking forces to overcome defenses. This detail emphasizes the inevitability of Jerusalem's fall. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their engineering prowess in constructing such ramps, as seen in the siege of Lachish. The ramp signifies the relentless advance of judgment, unstoppable by human means.<p><b>Set up camps against it:</b><br>The setting up of camps indicates a prolonged siege, with the besieging army establishing a base of operations. This reflects the historical reality of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, which lasted for several years. The camps symbolize the persistent and unyielding nature of divine judgment, as well as the complete encirclement and isolation of the city.<p><b>And place battering rams around it on all sides:</b><br>Battering rams were used to break through city gates and walls, a common practice in ancient warfare. The mention of battering rams on all sides highlights the totality of the assault and the futility of resistance. This imagery points to the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, leaving no part of the city untouched. It also foreshadows the complete destruction that would come upon Jerusalem, as prophesied by Ezekiel and fulfilled in 586 BC.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city symbolically represented by the brick in Ezekiel's prophetic act, which is under siege as a sign of impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege.htm">Siege</a></b><br>A military tactic used in ancient warfare, symbolizing the impending judgment and destruction that Jerusalem would face due to its disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_actions_as_prophetic_messages.htm">Symbolic Actions as Prophetic Messages</a></b><br>Ezekiel's actions serve as a visual representation of God's message.

The only power by whom such a siege could be undertaken was Babylon, Egypt having been so thoroughly defeated as to be for a long time out of the question; and Nebuchadnezzar had now, within a few years, thrice completely conquered Judaea, had carried two of its kings, one after the other, captive in chains, and had also taken into captivity 10,000 of the chief of the people, setting up as king over the remnant a creature of his own, who was yet of the royal house of Judah. A fresh siege could only be the result of a fresh rebellion, an act, under the circumstances, of simple infatuation. Yet of this infatuation Zedekiah, through the "anger of the LORD" (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm" title="For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.">2Kings 24:20</a>), was guilty, and thus the prophecy was fulfilled. The prophecy itself is undated, but must have been between the call of Ezekiel in the fifth month of the fifth year (<a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>) and the next date given (<a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>), the sixth month of the sixth year. The siege began, according to <a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.">Jeremiah 52:4</a>, in the tenth month of the ninth year, so that the prophecy preceded its fulfilment by only about four years.<p><span class= "bld">Build a fort against it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a tower. </span>The several acts of a siege are graphically described. First the city is invested; then a tower is built, as was customary, of sufficient height to overlook the walls and thus obtain information of the doings of the besieged. Instruments for throwing stones or darts were also sometimes placed in such towers; next is "cast a mound against it," a common operation of the ancient siege (comp. <a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.">Isaiah 37:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-24.htm" title="Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken is come to pass; and, behold, you see it.">Jeremiah 32:24</a>), in which a sort of artificial hill was built to give the besiegers an advantage; then the camps (not merely camp) are set round the city to prevent ingress and egress; and finally "the battering rams" are brought against the walls. These last were heavy beams, headed with iron, and slung in towers, so that they could be swung against the walls with great force. They are frequently to be noticed in the representations of sieges found in the ruins of Nineveh. The practice of forming the end of the beam like a ram's head belongs to the Greeks and Romans; but the instrument itself was much older. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lay siege against it,</span> etc. The wonder would increase as the spectators looked on what followed.
