The sixth year refers to the sixth year of King Jehoiachin's exile, around 592 BC. This period was marked by political turmoil and spiritual decline in Judah. The precision of the date underscores the prophetic nature of Ezekiel's ministry, as God often provided specific times for His revelations.<p><b>I was sitting in my house</b><br>Ezekiel's location in his house indicates a private setting, suggesting that the vision was intended for a select audience. Prophets often received revelations in personal spaces, emphasizing the intimate nature of their relationship with God. This setting contrasts with the public nature of many prophetic acts, highlighting the personal responsibility of the prophet to convey God's message.<p><b>and the elders of Judah were sitting before me</b><br>The presence of the elders signifies a formal gathering, likely for counsel or seeking divine guidance. The elders represented the leadership and spiritual authority of the exiled community. Their presence indicates a recognition of Ezekiel's prophetic role, despite the people's general resistance to prophetic messages. This gathering reflects the ongoing concern for Judah's future amidst exile.<p><b>and there the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me</b><br>The phrase "the hand of the Lord GOD" signifies divine intervention and empowerment. It indicates that Ezekiel was about to receive a vision or message from God. This expression is used throughout Ezekiel to denote moments of significant prophetic revelation. The imagery of God's hand suggests both authority and intimacy, as God directly engages with His prophet to convey His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage.

It also appears that he lived in his own house. Judah is not used in contradistinction to Israel; but as the captives were chiefly of the tribe of Judah, so their elders were known as "the elders of Judah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass,</span> etc. We begin with a fresh date. One year and one month had passed since the vision of Chebar, and had been occupied partly by the acted, partly by the spoken, prophecies of the preceding chapters. In the mean time, things had gone from bad to worse in Jerusalem. In the absence of the higher priests, idolatry was more rampant, and had found its way even into the temple. It is probable that tidings of this had reached Ezekiel, as we know that frequent communications passed between the exiles and those they had left behind (<a href="/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1-3, 9, 25</a>). Directly or indirectly, Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Genesisariah the son of Hilkiah. may have conveyed a message, orally or written, from Jeremiah himself. Some such report may have led to the visit from the <span class="cmt_word">elders of Judah,</span> if we understand by that term the exiles of Tel-Abib. I venture, however, on the conjecture that possibly those who came to the prophet were actually visitors who had come from Judah. Elsewhere, as in <a href="/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and Ezekiel 20:1, those who thus came are described as "elders of Israel," or the captives (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), "they of the Captivity" (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>). In either case, the visions that follow gain a special significance. The prophet becomes the seer. It is given to him to know, in a manner which finds a spurious analogue in the alleged mental travelling of the clairvoyant of modern psychology, what is passing in the city from which the messengers had come - and to show that he knows it. With such facts before his eyes, what other answer can there be than that evil must meet its doom? And so we pass into the second series of prophecies which ends with <a href="/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>. It would seem as if the enquirers had kept silent as well as the prophet. We are not told that they asked anything. His look and manner, perhaps also attitude and gesture, forbade utterance. The <span class="cmt_word">hand of the Lord</span> - the trance state - was in the act to fall on him (see notes on Ezekiel 3:14, 22). When the trance state was over, we may think of him as reporting and recording what he had thus seen in vision.. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the sixth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
