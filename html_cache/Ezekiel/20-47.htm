In biblical times, it was sparsely populated and often symbolized desolation. The "forest" here is metaphorical, representing the people of Judah. This imagery is used to convey the severity of God's impending judgment. The Negev's geographical location emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the prophecy, affecting the entire land.<p><b>Hear the word of the LORD!</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and urgency of the message. The call to "hear" is a common prophetic introduction, demanding attention and obedience. It highlights the divine origin of the message, emphasizing that it is not merely a human warning but a direct communication from God.<p><b>This is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>The repetition of divine titles ("Lord GOD") reinforces the sovereignty and power of God. It serves as a reminder that the prophecy is not Ezekiel's own words but a declaration from the Almighty. This introduction is typical in prophetic literature, establishing the credibility and seriousness of the message.<p><b>I am about to ignite in you a fire,</b><br>Fire is a frequent biblical symbol of judgment and purification. In this context, it represents the impending destruction that God will bring upon Judah. The imagery of fire suggests both the intensity and the consuming nature of the judgment. It also alludes to the refining process, where impurities are burned away, leaving only what is pure.<p><b>and it will devour all your trees, both green and dry.</b><br>The "trees" symbolize the people of Judah, with "green" representing those who are seemingly alive and prosperous, and "dry" indicating those who are spiritually dead or unproductive. The inclusion of both types signifies that the judgment will be indiscriminate, affecting all levels of society. This imagery connects to other biblical passages where trees represent people or nations (e.g., <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>).<p><b>The blazing flame will not be quenched,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unstoppable nature of God's judgment. The unquenchable fire signifies total destruction, echoing other biblical instances of divine wrath, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It serves as a warning of the seriousness of turning away from God and the inevitability of His justice.<p><b>and by it every face from south to north will be scorched.</b><br>The phrase "from south to north" indicates the comprehensive scope of the judgment, affecting the entire land of Judah. The use of "every face" suggests that no one will escape the consequences. This totality reflects the thoroughness of God's judgment and serves as a call to repentance. The imagery of being "scorched" conveys the intense suffering and devastation that will result from the divine fire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

God singles out the &#8220;Negev&#8221;&#8212;the southern territory&#8212;to begin the warning, yet the image quickly broadens to the whole nation. By speaking to a forest rather than directly to individuals, the Lord underscores the collective guilt of the land.

The message carries divine weight; therefore, Ezekiel speaks with confidence even when the populace mocks (<a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am about to ignite in you a fire</b><p>God Himself lights the blaze (<a href="/ezekiel/22-31.htm">Ezekiel 22:31</a>). The Babylonian invasion will not be a random geopolitical event; it is a divinely directed act of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>).

Jesus alludes to this verse on the way to the cross: &#8220;For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>). The point: no one in Judah is exempt; all have sinned (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Green trees: outwardly religious leaders, temple worshipers, those presuming safety.<p>&#8226; Dry trees: obvious idolaters, corrupt officials, the spiritually apathetic.<p>Both stand before the same holy standard (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The blazing flame will not be quenched</b><p>Once God&#8217;s patience reaches its limit, the sentence is irreversible (<a href="/jeremiah/17-27.htm">Jeremiah 17:27</a>).

The phrase also foreshadows the eternal, unquenchable fire reserved for final judgment (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-48</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and by it every face from south to north will be scorched.</b><p>The fire spreads &#8220;from south to north,&#8221; covering the entire land&#8212;from the Negev up through Jerusalem to the northernmost border (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-4</a>). God&#8217;s discipline is comprehensive; no corner escapes His reach (<a href="/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>). The scorching of &#8220;every face&#8221; pictures personal accountability: each individual feels the heat (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a> portrays God&#8217;s certain, sweeping judgment on Judah. He likens the nation to a forest set ablaze&#8212;ignited by His own hand&#8212;where no tree, green or dry, survives untouched. The call to &#8220;hear&#8221; highlights divine mercy; the unquenchable fire underscores divine holiness. The passage warns that persistent rebellion invites inevitable judgment, yet it also reminds readers today to heed God&#8217;s word while repentance is still possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">Every green tree in thee, and every dry tree</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>persons of every condition, the condition here having reference probably to their moral state; the approaching desolation should be so complete, that, like other national judgments, it should sweep away all alike. No distinction could be made in favour of those who might be less ripe in evil. Our Lord may have had this expression in mind in <a href="/luke/23-31.htm" title="For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?">Luke 23:31</a>. At the close of the verse, by introducing the words "all faces," the prophet, as he so often does, breaks away from the figure to its interpretation, and shows plainly the meaning of the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All faces from the south to the north,</span> etc. The phrase seems, at first, to pass from the figure to the reality. Possibly, however, <span class="cmt_word">face</span> may stand for "the outward appearance," the leaves and branches, of the trees. "From the south (<span class="accented">Negeb</span>) to the north" takes the place of the older "from Dan to Beersheba" (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). Of that "fire" of judgment, it is said, as in our Lord's use of a like imagery, that it shall not be quenched (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>).
