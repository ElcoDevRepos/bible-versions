In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such dimensions would denote a place of great importance and reverence. The use of "cubits," a common biblical unit of measurement, ties this vision to the historical context of Israel, where the cubit was approximately 18 inches. This height suggests a divine standard, as the temple is a place where God&#8217;s presence dwells. The number sixty, often associated with completeness or perfection in biblical numerology, underscores the temple's role as a perfect dwelling place for God. This vision of the temple, given to Ezekiel during the Babylonian exile, serves as a prophetic hope for restoration and a future where God&#8217;s presence is fully realized among His people.<p><b>The gateway extended around to the gatepost of the courtyard.</b><br>The description of the gateway extending to the gatepost of the courtyard highlights the interconnectedness of the temple's structure, symbolizing access to God and the orderly approach to His presence. In the ancient temple layout, the courtyard was a significant area where worshippers gathered, and the gateway served as the transition from the outside world into the sacred space. This architectural detail emphasizes the importance of proper approach and reverence when entering the presence of God. The courtyard, often a place of sacrifice and worship, represents the communal aspect of worship and the gathering of God&#8217;s people. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gateway through which believers enter into the presence of God, as He declared Himself to be the "door" in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>. The vision of the temple, with its precise measurements and design, points to the order and holiness required in worship and the ultimate fulfillment of God&#8217;s presence with His people through

Like a surveyor marking off a promised possession, the angel continues precise measurements (cf. <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Gateposts signify the threshold between what is outside and what is holy. Their measurement assures that access to God&#8217;s house is not haphazard but ordered by Him (cf. <a href="/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal act of measuring underscores the certainty of a future physical temple, reinforcing God&#8217;s faithfulness to every detail of His covenant promises (<a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To be sixty cubits high</b><p>&#8226; Sixty cubits (about ninety feet) speaks of grandeur and permanence, echoing the imposing front of Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>) and the bronze pillars Jachin and Boaz (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Height points upward, drawing eyes&#8212;and hearts&#8212;toward heaven (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It also distinguishes the sacred space from common ground, reminding worshipers of God&#8217;s transcendence (<a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Even as the measurement is literal, it conveys spiritual realities: majesty, security, and the elevation of God&#8217;s glory above all else (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The gateway extended around</b><p>&#8226; The phrase suggests a surrounding porch or arcade that encircled the entrance (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-8.htm">Ezekiel 40:8&#8211;11</a>).

The literal measurements underscore His faithfulness, while the grandeur proclaims His majesty and the ordered path into His presence. Every cubit assures His people that access to Him is certain, secure, and ultimately fulfilled in Christ, the true and living Gate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made also posts</span>. In using the verb "made" the prophet either went back in thought to the time when the man who then explained the building had fashioned it (Hengstenberg); or he employed the term in the sense of <span class="accented">constituit</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed or estimated, "inasmuch as such a height could not be measured from the bottom to the top with the measuring-red" (Keil). The "posts," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of ver. 9, were sixty cubits high, and corresponded to the towers in modern churches. To the objection sometimes urged against what is called the "exaggerated" height of these columns, Kliefoth replies, "If it had been considered that our church towers have grown up out of gate-pillars, that one can see, not merely in Egyptian obelisks and Turkish minarets, but also in our own hollow factory chimneys, how upon a base of two cubits, square pillars of sixty cubits high can be erected, and that finally the talk is of a colossal building seen in vision, no critical difficulties would have been discovered in this statement as to height." The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">even unto the post of the court round about the gate</span>, should read, <span class="accented">and the court</span> reached <span class="accented">unto the post</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> being used collectively), <span class="accented">the gate</span> being <span class="accented">round about</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">the court round about the gate</span> reached to <span class="accented">the pillars</span> (Keil); or, <span class="accented">at the pillar the court</span> was round <span class="accented">about the gate</span> (Kliefoth). The sense is, that the court lay round about the inner egress from the gate. The Authorized Version, with which Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' agrees, thinks of an inner hall between the porch of the gate and the two most western guard-chambers, round the sides of which the sixty-cubit columns stood. Ewald, following the corrupt text of the LXX., translates, "And the threshold of the outer vestibule twenty cubits, the gate court abutting on the chambers round about." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next he measured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
