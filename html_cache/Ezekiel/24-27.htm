In the context of Ezekiel, it points to the day when Jerusalem falls, fulfilling the prophecies of judgment against the city. This emphasizes God's sovereignty over time and events.<p><b>your mouth will be opened</b><br>Ezekiel had been rendered mute by God as a sign to the people, only speaking when God gave him a message (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>). The opening of his mouth signifies the end of this period of silence, marking a new phase in his prophetic ministry. It underscores the idea that God controls the prophetic voice.<p><b>to him who has escaped</b><br>This refers to a survivor from the destruction of Jerusalem who would bring news of the city's fall. The escapee serves as a witness to the fulfillment of God's judgment, highlighting the reality of the prophecies given through Ezekiel.<p><b>you will speak and no longer be mute</b><br>Ezekiel's ability to speak again symbolizes the completion of a prophetic cycle. His silence had been a sign of impending judgment, and his restored speech indicates a shift towards a message of hope and restoration. This transition is crucial in understanding the role of prophets as both warners and comforters.<p><b>So you will be a sign to them</b><br>Ezekiel himself becomes a living sign to the people, embodying the message of God. This concept of a prophet as a sign is seen throughout scripture, where the lives and actions of prophets serve as tangible demonstrations of divine truth (e.g., Hosea's marriage in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>).<p><b>and they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the ultimate purpose of God's actions: to reveal His identity and sovereignty to His people. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where recognition of God's lordship is central.

He had abundantly foretold the result, and now awaited the issue in silence. He has, however, recorded a considerable number of prophecies against foreign nations (Ezekiel 25-32).<p>Here one great division of the prophecies of Ezekiel closes. They have been hitherto occupied almost exclusively with reproofs for sin and with warnings of impending judgment upon his people. The following prophecies, as far as Ezekiel 32, are indeed of the same character, but are directed entirely against foreign nations. This collection, as noticed in the Introduction, ? 4, is not arranged chronologically like the rest of the book, but on the plan of putting together the prophecies against each nation. <a href="/context/ezekiel/29-17.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 29:17-21</a> is dated more than sixteen years after the fall of Jerusalem, and Ezekiel 32 about two months after the tidings of that event; all the others which are dated are before, but only a little before, the capture of Jerusalem. Most of those undated seem to be in their chronological place, except that the first of them (Ezekiel 25) was evidently after the fall of Jerusalem.<p>After that great judgment was made known to the prophet, there is a marked change in his utterances, and from that time his general tone is far more cheering and consolatory.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
