In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their disobedience. The statutes refer to the divine laws given to Israel, which are foundational to the covenant relationship between God and His people. This echoes the covenant language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>, where Moses instructs the Israelites to follow God's decrees to live and take possession of the land. The statutes are not merely legalistic requirements but are intended to guide the people in a life that reflects God's holiness and righteousness.<p><b>keep My ordinances</b><br>Ordinances are specific decrees or commands that God has established. In the historical context, these would include the ceremonial, civil, and moral laws given to Israel. Keeping these ordinances was a sign of faithfulness and commitment to God. This phrase highlights the continuity of God's expectations for His people, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/18-4.htm">Leviticus 18:4-5</a>, where God commands the Israelites to keep His statutes and ordinances to live by them. The emphasis on keeping ordinances underscores the relational aspect of the covenant, where obedience is a response to God's grace and love.<p><b>and practice them</b><br>Practicing God's laws involves not just understanding or acknowledging them but actively living them out. This phrase calls for a holistic application of God's commands in daily life. It reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead, as stated in <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>. The practice of God's laws is a demonstration of genuine faith and commitment. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, this would involve integrating God's commands into every aspect of life, from worship to social justice, reflecting God's character to the surrounding nations.<p><b>Then they will be My people</b><br>This phrase signifies the restoration of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Being God's people is a central theme throughout the Bible, beginning with God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>. It indicates a special status and identity, chosen and set apart for God's purposes. In Ezekiel's context, this promise offers hope to the exiled Israelites that they will be restored to their land and relationship with God. It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where believers in Christ are grafted into God's people, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>.<p><b>and I will be their God</b><br>This is the ultimate promise of the covenant, where God commits to being the protector, provider, and guide for His people. It reflects the intimate relationship God desires with His creation, as seen in the repeated covenant formula throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This promise finds its fulfillment in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God, making it possible for believers to have a personal relationship with Him. <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a> echoes this promise, where God dwells with His people in the new creation, signifying the consummation of His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often involving visions and symbolic acts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are in exile due to their disobedience to God.
