This connection emphasizes Tyre's influence and reach across the Mediterranean.<p><b>because of your great wealth of goods;</b><br>Tyre's wealth was legendary in the ancient world, derived from its strategic location and its role as a hub for trade between the East and the West. The city's prosperity was built on the exchange of luxury goods, textiles, and other valuable commodities. This wealth is a testament to Tyre's economic power and the allure it held for trading partners like Tarshish.<p><b>they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your wares.</b><br>These metals were highly valued in the ancient world for various uses, including currency, tools, weapons, and construction. Silver was a standard of wealth and trade, while iron was crucial for making tools and weapons. Tin, often combined with copper to make bronze, was essential for the Bronze Age civilizations. Lead had various applications, including in construction and as a material for writing tablets.
