The Bible frequently warns against turning away from righteousness, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20-22</a>. The cultural context of Ezekiel's time involved a strong emphasis on community and covenant faithfulness, where individual actions could impact the entire community's standing with God.<p><b>and I put a stumbling block before him</b><br>The "stumbling block" is a metaphor for divine intervention that leads to judgment or correction. In biblical terms, a stumbling block can be a test or trial that reveals the true nature of one's faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32-33</a>. This reflects God's sovereignty and justice, ensuring that those who turn from righteousness face consequences.<p><b>he will die</b><br>The consequence of spiritual death is emphasized here, aligning with the biblical principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). In the Old Testament, physical death often symbolized spiritual separation from God. This phrase underscores the seriousness of turning away from righteousness and the ultimate penalty for sin.<p><b>If you did not warn him</b><br>This phrase addresses the responsibility of the prophet or spiritual leader to provide guidance and warning. Ezekiel's role as a watchman (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>) is to alert the people to their spiritual danger. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to admonish one another (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p><b>he will die in his sin</b><br>The emphasis here is on personal accountability. Each individual is responsible for their own actions and will face the consequences of their sin if they do not repent. This aligns with the principle found in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where each person is accountable for their own sin.<p><b>and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered</b><br>This phrase indicates that past righteousness does not compensate for future sin. It reflects the biblical teaching that perseverance in faith is necessary for salvation (<a href="/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>). The cultural context of covenant relationships in the Old Testament required ongoing faithfulness, not just past obedience.<p><b>And I will hold you responsible for his blood</b><br>This phrase underscores the serious responsibility of spiritual leaders to guide and warn their communities. The concept of being "responsible for his blood" is a legal and moral obligation, similar to the role of a watchman who must alert the city to danger (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>). This responsibility is echoed in the New Testament, where leaders are accountable for the souls they oversee (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The duty of the prophet, therefore, is not only to seek to turn the wicked from his evil way, but also to warn the righteous against falling into the same path. Both terms must necessarily be taken as comparative; but they show that there was even now a considerable difference in character among the captives.<p><span class= "bld">I lay a stumblingblock before him.--</span>A "stumbling-block" is anything at which people actually stumble, whether intended for that purpose or, on the contrary, designed for their highest good. Thus Christ is foretold as a stumbling-block to both the houses of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>), and is several times spoken of as such by the apostles (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/context/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone;">Romans 9:32-33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>). The word is used oftener by Ezekiel than by all the other Old Testament writers together; in <a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm" title="They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.">Ezekiel 7:19</a> the riches of the people are spoken of as their stumbling-block, and in <a href="/ezekiel/44-12.htm" title="Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, said the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 44:12</a> (marg.) the sinful Levites are described as a stumbling-block. The meaning here is plainly, "when a man perverts any of God's gifts or providences into an occasion of sin." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From his righteousness.</span> The Hebrew gives the plural, "his righteousnesses" - all his single righteous acts that lie behind. <span class="cmt_word">I lay a stumbling block,</span> etc. The word is again characteristic (<a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3, 4</a>). It occurs in <a href="/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>, and Ezekiel may have learnt the use of the word from him. It is found also in <a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; but the date of these, according to the so called higher criticism, may be later than Ezekiel. In <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>: the word is different. The English word sufficiently expresses the sense. One of the acts of Eastern malignity was to put a stone in a man's way, that he might fall and hurt himself Here the putting the stone is described as the act of Jehovah, and is applied to anything that tempts a man to evil, and so to his own destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>). The thought is startling to us, and seems at variance with true conceptions of the Divine will (<a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>). The explanation is to be found in the fact that the prophet's mind did not draw the distinction which we draw between evil permitted and the same evil decreed. All, from this point of view, is as God wills, and even those who thwart that will are indeed fulfilling it. Glimpses are given of the purpose which leads to the permission or decree. In the case now before us the man has turned from his righteousness before the stumbling block is laid in his way. The temptation is permitted that the man may become conscious of his evil (so <a href="/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>). If the prophet preacher does his duty, the man may conquer the temptation, and the stumbling block may become a "stepping stone to higher things." If, through the prophet's negligence, h<span class="cmt_word">e</span> comes unwarned, and stumbles and falls, he, as in the case of the wicked, bears the penalty of his guilt, but the prophet has here also the guilt of blood upon his soul. The "righteousnesses" of the man (here, as before, we have the plural), his individual acts of righteousness, shall not be remembered, because he was tried, and found wanting in the essential element of all righteousness. The highest development of the thought is found in the fact that Christ himself is represented as a "stumbling stone" (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). St. Paul's solution of the problem is found in the question, "Have they stumbled that they should fall?" (<a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). Was that the end contemplated in the Divine purpose Will it really be the end? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now if a righteous man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turns</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
