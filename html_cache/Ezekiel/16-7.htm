The imagery of a plant thriving suggests growth, prosperity, and divine blessing. In biblical context, Israel is often depicted as a vineyard or a plant (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-11</a>), emphasizing God's role as the cultivator. The field represents the world or the land of Israel, where God has placed His people to grow and bear fruit. This nurturing is reminiscent of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where He promised to make their descendants numerous and prosperous (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 15</a>:5).<p><b>You grew up and matured and became very beautiful.</b><br>This phrase indicates the development and maturation of Israel as a nation. The beauty described here can be seen as the spiritual and cultural richness that Israel attained under God's guidance. Historically, this could refer to the period of the united monarchy under David and Solomon, when Israel reached its peak in terms of political power, wealth, and influence (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-25</a>). The beauty also symbolizes the spiritual beauty of Israel when it was faithful to God, reflecting His glory and righteousness (<a href="/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>).<p><b>Your breasts were formed and your hair grew,</b><br>This imagery of physical maturity signifies the nation's readiness for a deeper relationship with God, akin to a marriage covenant. In ancient Near Eastern culture, physical maturity was often associated with readiness for marriage, symbolizing Israel's potential to enter into a covenant relationship with God. The development of breasts and hair can also be seen as a metaphor for the growth of Israel's religious and cultural identity, as they received the Law and established worship practices centered around the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>).<p><b>but you were naked and bare.</b><br>Despite the growth and beauty, Israel's nakedness and bareness highlight vulnerability and shame due to sin and idolatry. Nakedness in the Bible often symbolizes exposure and disgrace (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>). This phrase underscores Israel's spiritual state before God, revealing their need for His covering and righteousness. It serves as a reminder of Israel's dependence on God for protection and moral guidance, as well as the consequences of turning away from Him (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>). The imagery foreshadows the need for redemption and the covering of sin, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who provides the garments of salvation and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Israel&#8217;s existence and increase are the direct result of His purposeful care, just as <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> describes the righteous person who &#8220;is like a tree planted by streams of water.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase speaks of life, vigor, and fruitfulness (<a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>). Nothing about Israel&#8217;s initial success can be traced to her own merit; it is entirely the outworking of divine grace.<p>&#8226; By affirming, &#8220;I made you thrive,&#8221; the Lord underscores His sovereign initiative&#8212;a reminder echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, where He tells His people that He gives them &#8220;power to gain wealth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You grew up and matured</b><p>&#8220;You grew up and matured&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The nation advances from infancy to adolescence, illustrating God&#8217;s design for steady spiritual development. Samuel &#8220;continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>), a pattern later mirrored in <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a> for Jesus.<p>&#8226; Mature growth includes stability and wisdom, goals emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>: &#8220;we are to grow up in all things into Him who is the head&#8212;Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s maturing years highlight God&#8217;s patience; He allows time and space for His people to develop, even when their responses are inconsistent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You became very beautiful</b><p>&#8220;You became very beautiful&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical beauty pictures the attractiveness of a life shaped by God. Song of Songs 4:7 exclaims, &#8220;You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later calls Tyre &#8220;perfect in beauty&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>), yet here that description belongs to Jerusalem, stressing the special honor God intended for His chosen city.<p>&#8226; True beauty, <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a> reminds us, comes from reverence for the LORD; when Israel lived under His covenant care, her radiance was unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your breasts were formed and your hair grew</b><p>&#8220;Your breasts were formed and your hair grew&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; These intimate details mark the transition to womanhood&#8212;readiness for covenant relationship. Song of Songs 7:3 celebrates similar imagery, portraying fullness and maturity.<p>&#8226; God is not speaking crudely; He is emphasizing the moment when His people became capable of entering a binding union with Him, just as a bride prepares for marriage (<a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference to hair, often a symbol of glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>), shows that God had endowed Israel with dignity and distinction among the nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But you were naked and bare</b><p>&#8220;but you were naked and bare&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Despite maturity, Israel still lacked covering&#8212;she was vulnerable and exposed. <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a> records Adam and Eve&#8217;s sudden awareness of nakedness, revealing guilt and need.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a> warns the complacent church at Laodicea, &#8220;You do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.&#8221; The absence of proper clothing pictures a deficiency in righteousness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/2-3.htm">Hosea 2:3</a> speaks of God stripping an unfaithful wife &#8220;naked,&#8221; underscoring that covenant blessings can be forfeited. Here, prior to her adornment (<a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8&#8211;14</a>), Israel has no righteousness of her own and must rely wholly on God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a> traces Israel&#8217;s story from helpless infancy to poised womanhood, all under God&#8217;s nurturing hand.

The verse highlights divine grace, human dependence, and the need for God-given righteousness before covenant blessings can be enjoyed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">I have caused thee.</span>--Omit the "have," and modify the tenses throughout the verse.
