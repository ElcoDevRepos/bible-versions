Historically, this can be linked to the Babylonian Empire, known for its military might and ruthlessness, which conquered many nations, including Egypt. The imagery of cutting down a tree is often used in the Bible to signify the fall of a nation or leader (<a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>). This reflects God's sovereignty over nations, using even those who do not know Him to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>Its branches have fallen on the mountains and in every valley;</b><br>The fallen branches symbolize the widespread impact of Egypt's downfall. Mountains and valleys represent the entire landscape, indicating that the consequences of Egypt's fall were felt throughout the region. This imagery emphasizes the totality of the destruction and the far-reaching effects of God's judgment. It also serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and self-reliance.<p><b>its boughs lay broken in all the earth&#8217;s ravines.</b><br>The broken boughs in the ravines further illustrate the complete devastation and humiliation of Egypt. Ravines, being low places, symbolize the depths to which Egypt has fallen. This can be seen as a metaphor for the humbling of a once-proud nation. The imagery of brokenness is consistent with biblical themes of judgment and restoration, where God breaks down the proud to eventually bring about repentance and renewal.<p><b>And all the peoples of the earth left its shade and abandoned it.</b><br>This phrase indicates the loss of influence and protection that Egypt once provided to other nations. The "shade" represents the security and prosperity that Egypt offered as a powerful nation. With its fall, those who once relied on Egypt for support and alliance have now abandoned it. This reflects the transient nature of earthly power and alliances, contrasting with the eternal and unchanging nature of God's kingdom. It also serves as a reminder of the futility of placing trust in human strength rather than in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Refers to non-Israelite nations, often used to describe those who do not follow the God of Israel.

For Egypt&#8212;and for every nation&#8212;trusting in worldly might invites abandonment; true refuge is only found in the Lord (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a> uses the felling of a majestic cedar to depict God&#8217;s decisive judgment on Assyria, serving as a warning to Egypt and to every proud power. Foreign invaders (Babylon) cut the empire down; its scattered branches show total ruin; its broken boughs underscore irreversible loss; and the flight of those once sheltered exposes the emptiness of earthly security. The verse affirms that God humbles nations that exalt themselves, while offering lasting shelter only to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Gone down.</span>--Because the cedar is represented as growing upon the height of Lebanon.
