The term "abominations" refers to the idolatrous practices and moral corruption that had permeated the society. In the context of Ezekiel, these abominations included idol worship, child sacrifice, and other detestable practices that were contrary to the covenant relationship with God. The use of "all" emphasizes the totality and extent of their sins. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26-30</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>, where God explicitly forbids such practices. The abominations are not just religious infractions but are seen as a breach of the covenant, which had severe consequences.<p><b>I will do to you what I have never done before</b><br>This phrase underscores the unprecedented nature of the coming judgment. Historically, Jerusalem had faced sieges and destruction, but the impending judgment was to be unparalleled. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where God warns of the dire consequences of disobedience. The phrase also reflects the seriousness of the situation, as God, who is slow to anger and abounding in love (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>), is moved to act in a way that is without precedent. The historical context includes the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, which was a catastrophic event for the Jewish people.<p><b>and will never do again</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the singularity of the judgment. It suggests that the destruction of Jerusalem would be so severe that it would stand alone in its intensity. This can be seen as a prophetic statement, emphasizing the finality and completeness of the judgment. Theologically, it points to the seriousness of sin and the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate iniquity. The phrase also serves as a warning to future generations about the consequences of turning away from God. In a broader biblical context, it can be compared to the unique nature of the final judgment described in Revelation, where God's ultimate justice will be executed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often through symbolic acts and vivid visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of Jerusalem is the focal point of God's judgment in this passage.

Jerusalem&#8217;s sins were not isolated slip-ups; they were &#8220;abominations.&#8221; Think of everything Ezekiel had already witnessed: images of crawling beasts on the temple walls (<a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10-11</a>), women weeping for Tammuz (8:14), men bowing eastward to the sun (8:16).

Similar language appears in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>: &#8220;Just as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good &#8230; so the LORD will rejoice over you to ruin and destroy you.&#8221; He is the active Agent, not a passive observer, because covenant curses flow from the same covenant Lord who once blessed. <a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30-31</a> echoes the sober reality: &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221;<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; Divine judgment is never random; it is the purposeful action of a righteous Judge.<p>&#8226; A personal God takes sin personally&#8212;hence &#8220;I will do.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Discipline aims at correction and eventual restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what I have never done before</b><p>The punishment coming in 586 BC would be unprecedented. <a href="/lamentations/4-6.htm">Lamentations 4:6</a> groans, &#8220;The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than that of Sodom.&#8221; Siege-induced cannibalism is foretold in <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a> and matched by <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>.

But all question whether Ezekiel here looks forward to that calamity, and all comparison between that and the destruction under Nebuchadnezzar, are out of place. What the prophet here intends is not a comparison between different judgments upon the Jews, but between God's treatment of them and of others. As they had received at His hand higher opportunities and privileges than He had before given or would afterwards give to any other nation, so must the punishment for their sin be more severe and more conspicuous than He had inflicted or would inflict on any other. All the Divine judgments upon them through all time may therefore be considered as here coming into view. The present captivity and the impending destruction of the temple were but single features of a long series of judgments, in the course of which the terrible particulars mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm" title="Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.">Ezekiel 5:10</a> should have place, ending with what is the present condition of the people before our eyes, scattered "into all the winds."
