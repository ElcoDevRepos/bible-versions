It emphasizes the humanity of the prophet Ezekiel, distinguishing him from God and highlighting his role as a representative of the people. This term is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus often refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His identification with humanity and His role as the Messiah.<p><b>hasn&#8217;t the rebellious house of Israel</b><br>The phrase "rebellious house of Israel" refers to the persistent disobedience and stubbornness of the Israelites. Throughout their history, the Israelites often turned away from God's commandments, leading to their exile. This rebellion is a central theme in the prophetic books, where prophets like Ezekiel are sent to call the people back to faithfulness. The term "house of Israel" encompasses the entire nation, emphasizing their collective responsibility and guilt.<p><b>asked you</b><br>The act of asking indicates a level of curiosity or confusion among the Israelites regarding Ezekiel's actions. Prophets often used symbolic acts to convey God's messages, and these acts sometimes puzzled the people. This questioning reflects their lack of understanding of God's purposes and their spiritual blindness.<p><b>&#8216;What are you doing?&#8217;</b><br>This question highlights the people's inability to comprehend the prophetic signs and messages. Ezekiel's actions were often symbolic, serving as visual prophecies of impending judgment or future restoration. The people's question underscores their spiritual dullness and failure to recognize the seriousness of their situation. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God's people fail to understand His messages, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>, where spiritual insight is necessary to grasp divine truths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Curiosity, however, is not the same as repentance (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Their question fulfills God&#8217;s intention: the enacted parable is meant to provoke inquiry so truth can be plainly declared (<a href="/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a>; 37:18).<p>&#8211; Yet the asking also exposes spiritual blindness&#8212;they see the prophet&#8217;s actions but fail to grasp their personal stake (<a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what are you doing?</b><p>&#8211; The question shows detachment, as though Ezekiel&#8217;s strange behavior has no bearing on them. God soon explains that the prophet is portraying the coming exile of Jerusalem&#8217;s inhabitants and king (<a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10-13</a>).<p>&#8211; Similar prophetic dramas&#8212;Isaiah walking barefoot (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>) or Jeremiah&#8217;s yoke (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2-7</a>)&#8212;served as vivid, undeniable warnings.<p>&#8211; The people&#8217;s bewilderment teaches us that signs are effective only when accompanied by obedient hearts (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-40</a>). God&#8217;s patience allows space for understanding, but judgment will fall on persistent unbelief (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a> captures a moment where God confronts a hard-hearted nation through a humble messenger. By addressing Ezekiel as &#8220;Son of man,&#8221; the Lord contrasts human frailty with divine authority. Calling Israel &#8220;rebellious&#8221; highlights covenant defiance dating back generations. Their question, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; reveals curiosity without commitment; they witness God&#8217;s warning yet remain aloof. The verse therefore exposes spiritual blindness and underscores God&#8217;s mercy in explaining His signs before executing judgment. Those who heed the message find hope; those who dismiss it confirm their rebellion and invite the exile that soon follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hasn&#8217;t</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the rebellious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
