The "spirit" here is understood as the Spirit of God, indicating that the movements of the creatures and the wheels are directed by God's will. This reflects the biblical theme of God's omnipresence and omnipotence, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges that God's Spirit is everywhere. The obedience of the creatures to the Spirit's direction serves as a model for believers to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in their lives, as emphasized in <a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>.<p><b>and the wheels would rise alongside them</b><br>The wheels are a significant part of Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing the mobility and omnipresence of God's throne. The rising of the wheels alongside the creatures suggests a seamless and harmonious movement, indicating that God's presence is not confined to one place. This imagery can be connected to the vision of God's chariot-throne, which is not limited by earthly constraints, similar to the vision in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>, where God's throne is described with wheels of burning fire. The rising of the wheels also signifies the elevation of God's purposes and plans, transcending human understanding.<p><b>because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and interconnectedness between the living creatures and the wheels, both animated by the same divine Spirit. The "living creatures" are often identified as cherubim, angelic beings that serve as guardians of God's holiness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>. The presence of the Spirit in both the creatures and the wheels underscores the theme of divine empowerment and the execution of God's will. This unity can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, perfectly embodying the will of the Father, as described in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>. The integration of the Spirit in both elements of the vision points to the seamless operation of God's kingdom, where all parts work together under His sovereign direction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are angelic beings, often identified as cherubim, that accompany the glory of God in Ezekiel's vision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheels.htm">Wheels</a></b><br>Part of the vision, these wheels are associated with the living creatures and symbolize the omnipresence and omnipotence of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit.htm">Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the divine presence or life force that directs the movement of the living creatures and the wheels.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Ezekiel received his visions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_omnipresence.htm">God's Sovereignty and Omnipresence</a></b><br>The vision of the wheels and living creatures illustrates God's ability to be present and active everywhere.

Their obedience is immediate:<p>&#8226; They neither delay nor debate; they simply follow (compare <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a> where similar heavenly beings serve nonstop).<p>&#8226; Their unified movement models harmony in service&#8212;an encouraging picture for believers called to &#8220;walk in step with the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/10-16.htm">Ezekiel 10:16</a> later confirms that these same creatures never veer off course.<p>Obedience is not optional in the heavenly realm; it is the natural response to God&#8217;s leading.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the wheels would rise alongside them</b><p>Next Ezekiel says, &#8220;and the wheels would rise alongside them.&#8221; These wheels, dazzling and full of eyes (<a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>), symbolize God&#8217;s omniscient activity:<p>&#8226; When the creatures ascend, the wheels ascend&#8212;there is perfect synchronization (see <a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>, where a fiery chariot carries Elijah upward).<p>&#8226; Their rising suggests unhindered mobility; nothing on earth restrains God&#8217;s throne-chariot (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The upward motion hints at heaven&#8217;s authority breaking into the earthly realm, foreshadowing <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a> where Christ is taken up before the disciples&#8217; eyes.<p>The picture reassures us that God&#8217;s purposes move flawlessly in every dimension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels</b><p>Finally, Ezekiel explains why this unity exists: &#8220;because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.&#8221;<p>&#8226; One Spirit permeates both beings and mechanisms; what appears separate is actually one coordinated entity (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;6</a> shows a similar diversity-in-unity principle among spiritual gifts).<p>&#8226; This indwelling Spirit guarantees harmony; there is no conflict of will (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a> reminds us it is God who works in us to will and to act).<p>&#8226; The shared Spirit means the throne-chariot is alive, not mechanical&#8212;a living expression of God&#8217;s presence (compare <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a> where the ark in heaven signals living covenant relationship).<p>The linkage between creatures and wheels underscores that all true service and movement in God&#8217;s kingdom springs from His indwelling power, not human initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a> paints a vivid portrait of God&#8217;s throne on the move: wherever God&#8217;s Spirit directs, the living creatures go, the wheels rise, and every component acts in seamless unity because the same Spirit energizes them all. The verse reminds us that divine guidance is absolute, obedience is immediate, and God&#8217;s purposes advance unhindered&#8212;truths that invite us to yield to the Spirit with the same unquestioning readiness we witness in Ezekiel&#8217;s vision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20, 21) <span class= "bld">The spirit of the living creature</span>--Not, as in the margin, "the spirit of life." The object of <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-19.htm" title="And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.">Ezekiel 1:19-21</a> is by every repetition and variety of expression to represent "the living creatures" and "the wheels" as one, animated by one spirit, and moved by one impulse. The word is the same throughout, and there was no "spirit of life" in the wheels independent of that of the living creatures. All formed together one strange, symbolic whole.<p>The mention in <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-19.htm" title="And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.">Ezekiel 1:19-21</a> of the wheels being "lifted up from the earth" simultaneously with the living creatures is not in opposition to the symbolism already explained, of the wheels resting upon the earth. That was to show that God's purposes are carried out as He wills in this world. This brings out, in addition, the perfect harmony of these purposes, whether relating to earth or to heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever the spirit was to go,</span> etc. The secret of the coincidence of the movements of the "living creatures" and of the "wheels" was found in the fact, which the prophet's intuition grasped, that the phenomena of life and law had one and the same originating source. For "the spirit of the living creature" (singular, because the four are regarded as one complex whole), the LXX., Vulgate, and Revised Version margin, give "the spirit of life," a rendering tenable in itself, but the contextual meaning of the word is in favour of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wherever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
