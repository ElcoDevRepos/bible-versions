The "nakedness of their fathers" implies engaging in sexual relations with a father's wife, which is considered an abomination. This act symbolizes a breakdown of moral and social order within the community. The phrase "in you" indicates that these actions are taking place within the city of Jerusalem, highlighting the pervasive corruption and sin among the people. This behavior reflects a broader pattern of disobedience to God's laws, which were intended to set Israel apart from the surrounding nations.<p><b>in you they violate women during their menstrual impurity.</b><br>This part of the verse addresses another specific violation of the Mosaic Law, found in <a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19 and 20</a>:18, which prohibits sexual relations with a woman during her menstrual period. This law was given to maintain ritual purity and respect for the natural processes God created. The act of violating this commandment signifies a disregard for God's holiness and the sanctity of His laws. It also reflects a lack of respect for women and their God-given dignity. The repetition of "in you" emphasizes that these transgressions are occurring within the community, underscoring the depth of Israel's spiritual and moral decay.

First Peter 4:17 echoes this when it says, &#8220;it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have uncovered the nakedness of their fathers</b><p>&#8226; This phrase points to incestuous sin&#8212;specifically sexual relations with a father&#8217;s wife or other near relative. <a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7-8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a> expressly forbid it: &#8220;You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father&#8217;s wife; it is your father&#8217;s nakedness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Uncovering &#8220;father&#8217;s nakedness&#8221; dishonors both father and God&#8217;s created order, striking at the foundation of family integrity.<p>&#8226; Paul later cites a similar scandal in the Corinthian church (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>) to show such sin remains intolerable under the New Covenant.<p>&#8226; The people knew these commands, yet chose open defiance. This rebellion reveals hearts hardened past mere weakness to willful contempt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They violate women during their menstrual impurity</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19 and 20</a>:18 prohibit sexual contact during a woman&#8217;s menstrual period: &#8220;You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her uncleanness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In Old-Testament worship, menstrual impurity symbolized the reality of sin and death; ignoring that boundary profaned what God called unclean and trampled His holiness (<a href="/isaiah/30-12.htm">Isaiah 30:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Violating women in that state added exploitation to impurity&#8212;treating covenant daughters as objects rather than image-bearers (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The blunt wording underscores callousness: these men were not merely indifferent to ritual law; they were predators dismissing a woman&#8217;s vulnerability for their own gratification.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a> exposes Jerusalem&#8217;s moral rot on two fronts: incest that shatters the family and sexual exploitation that scorns God-given boundaries. Both sins flaunt divine commands laid out clearly in Leviticus, proving the people&#8217;s rebellion is deliberate, not ignorant. When God&#8217;s own community abandons holiness, judgment is inevitable.
