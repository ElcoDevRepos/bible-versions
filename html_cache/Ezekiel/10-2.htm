It is not without significance that now the same person is made the agent of judgment. As God's love is turned to wrath by man's impenitence, and as His blessings given to man become curses by their abuse, so those employed by Him as the instruments of His loving-kindness become the very executioners of his "fury." The "coals of fire," the symbols of Divine wrath, are represented as "between the cherubim."
