It is a reminder of Ezekiel's role as a representative of humanity. The term "Son of Man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His role as the representative and redeemer of humanity.<p><b>He said to me,</b><br>The speaker is God, who directly communicates with Ezekiel. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of the message Ezekiel is to deliver. It reflects the prophetic tradition where God speaks to His chosen messengers, as seen with other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>eat what you find here.</b><br>This command symbolizes the internalization of God's message. Eating the scroll represents taking in God's words fully, making them a part of oneself. This act is similar to the experience of John in <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>, where he is also instructed to eat a scroll, signifying the acceptance and proclamation of God's message.<p><b>Eat this scroll,</b><br>The scroll contains God's words, likely filled with lamentation and warning for Israel. The act of eating signifies the prophet's acceptance and understanding of the message. In ancient Near Eastern culture, scrolls were the primary medium for recording important texts, emphasizing the significance of the message Ezekiel is to deliver.<p><b>then go and speak to the house of Israel.</b><br>Ezekiel's mission is to deliver God's message to the Israelites, who are in exile in Babylon. This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian Exile, a period of great turmoil and reflection for the Jewish people. The phrase underscores the prophetic duty to convey God's words to His people, regardless of their receptiveness, as seen in the ministries of other prophets like Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine speaker who commands Ezekiel to eat the scroll, symbolizing the internalization of His words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scroll.htm">Scroll</a></b><br>Represents the word of God, containing messages of lamentation, mourning, and woe (as described in the previous chapter).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>The intended audience of Ezekiel's prophetic messages, representing the people of Israel in exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a period of great trial and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/internalization_of_god's_word.htm">Internalization of God's Word</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was commanded to eat the scroll, believers are called to internalize Scripture, allowing it to transform their hearts and minds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Ezekiel's willingness to consume the scroll and speak to Israel demonstrates the importance of obedience in fulfilling God's mission for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_bittersweet_nature_of_god's_message.htm">The Bittersweet Nature of God's Message</a></b><br>God's word can be both comforting and convicting, offering hope and warning.

It appears more than ninety times in the book, grounding every vision in real history (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>; 2:3).<p>&#8226; The same phrase links Ezekiel with other servants called to stand before the Lord, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>) and points forward to Christ&#8217;s favorite self-designation (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God addresses Ezekiel personally, affirming that He speaks to individuals as well as nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>eat what you find here</b><p>&#8226; The command centers on obedience. Ezekiel must take exactly what God sets before him&#8212;nothing more, nothing less (<a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays God&#8217;s word as spiritual food. Jeremiah testified, &#8220;Your words were found, and I ate them&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>), while the psalmist delighted in God&#8217;s statutes &#8220;sweeter than honey&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is immediate: Ezekiel does not choose the menu; God provides and the prophet receives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eat this scroll</b><p>&#8226; The scroll holds God&#8217;s own words, &#8220;written on the front and back, filled with words of lamentation, mourning, and woe&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>). Eating signifies full internalization&#8212;not merely hearing, but digesting truth until it becomes part of him.<p>&#8226; John experiences the same prophetic meal in <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>, tasting sweetness followed by bitterness, illustrating both the joy of revelation and the weight of judgment.<p>&#8226; By commanding Ezekiel to eat first, God ensures the message will flow from a heart saturated with Scripture, not from personal opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then go and speak to the house of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The sequence matters: intake precedes output. Only a messenger who has fed on God&#8217;s word can faithfully pass it on (<a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel, already in exile, needs a voice that carries divine, not human, authority. Jeremiah&#8217;s commission echoes this pattern: &#8220;Do not say, &#8216;I am only a youth&#8217;&#8230; whatever I command you, you shall speak&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The task is confrontational yet hopeful. God&#8217;s word will both expose sin (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>) and offer restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a> unfolds a clear progression: God addresses His servant, supplies His word, requires total assimilation of that word, and only then sends the messenger to proclaim it.
