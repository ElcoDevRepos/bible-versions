The "fork in the road" symbolizes a moment of choice, reflecting the historical context of Babylon's military campaigns. Babylon was a dominant power, and its king often faced strategic decisions regarding conquests. This imagery of a fork in the road is also metaphorical for decision-making in life, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which emphasizes seeking God's guidance.<p><b>at the junction of the two roads</b><br>The "junction of the two roads" indicates a literal and figurative crossroads. Geographically, this could refer to the decision between attacking Jerusalem or another city, such as Rabbah of the Ammonites. Historically, Babylon's expansion required strategic military decisions, and this junction represents the moment of choosing a path that would impact the future of nations. This concept of a junction is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>, where the people are urged to choose the ancient paths of righteousness.<p><b>to seek an omen</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeking omens was a common practice for making decisions. This reflects the historical reliance on divination to interpret the will of the gods. The king's actions here contrast with the biblical teaching of seeking God's guidance through prayer and His word, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19-20</a>, which warns against consulting mediums and spiritists.<p><b>He shakes the arrows</b><br>Shaking arrows was a form of divination known as belomancy, where arrows were cast to determine a course of action. This practice highlights the reliance on pagan rituals rather than divine guidance. The use of arrows for divination is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, but it underscores the king's dependence on human methods rather than seeking the true God, contrasting with the biblical call to trust in God's sovereignty.<p><b>he consults the idols</b><br>Consulting idols was a common practice in Babylonian religion, where images and statues were believed to hold divine power. This reflects the cultural and religious context of the time, where idolatry was prevalent. The Bible consistently condemns idol worship, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, emphasizing the futility of seeking guidance from lifeless images instead of the living God.<p><b>he examines the liver</b><br>Examining the liver, known as hepatoscopy, was another form of divination practiced in ancient Mesopotamia. The liver of a sacrificed animal was inspected for signs believed to reveal the future. This practice underscores the king's reliance on pagan rituals. In contrast, the Bible teaches that true wisdom and guidance come from God, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourages believers to seek wisdom from God, who gives generously to all without finding fault.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>This refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, the ruler of the Babylonian Empire, known for his conquests and the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fork_in_the_road.htm">Fork in the Road</a></b><br>A literal and symbolic place where a decision must be made.

Though the king relies on arrows, idols, and livers, the LORD is the unseen Director, steering the outcome toward Jerusalem&#8217;s judgment exactly as prophesied. The scene warns that ignoring God&#8217;s clear word leaves people subject to futile substitutes, yet even the plans of unbelievers ultimately fulfill God&#8217;s sovereign purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">To use divination.</span>--Various particular forms of divination are mentioned just afterwards. This is a general term to include them all. Divination was always resorted to by the heathen on occasions of important questions. In this case, while Nebuchadnezzar thought in this way to determine his action, it was already fixed for him by a higher Power.<p><span class= "bld">Made his arrows bright.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">shook his arrows. </span>This was a mode of divination in use among the ancient Arabs, as well as in Mesopotamia, and something very similar is mentioned by Homer as practised among the ancient Greeks (<span class= "ital">II., </span>iii. 316). It continued to be used among the Arabs until the time of Mohammed, who strictly torbade it in the Koran (3:39, 5:4, 94). Several arrows, properly marked, were shaken together in a quiver or other vessel, and one drawn out. The mark upon the one drawn was supposed to indicate the will of the gods. It was thus simply one form of casting lots.<p><span class= "bld">Consulted with images.</span>--The particular images here mentioned were "teraphim," small idols, which are often spoken of in Scripture as used in divination by the Israelites themselves, and common also among the heathen. (See <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>, where the word "idolatry" is in the original "teraphim.") Nothing is known of the way in which these were used in divination.<p><span class= "bld">Looked in the liver.</span>--The inspection of the entrails of sacrificial victims, and especially of the liver, as a means of ascertaining the will of the gods, is familiar to every reader of classical literature. There is evidence that the same custom prevailed also in Babylonia. The king is represented as employing all these different kinds of divination to make sure of the proper path.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Babylon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_894.htm">Strong's 894: </a> </span><span class="str2">Babylon -- an eastern Mediterranean empire and its capital city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;ma&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fork</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the road,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
