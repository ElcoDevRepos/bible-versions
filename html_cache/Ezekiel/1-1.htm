The age of thirty was significant for priests in Israel, as it was the age at which they began their official duties (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>). Ezekiel, being from a priestly lineage, would have been acutely aware of this milestone, which adds a layer of personal significance to the timing of his prophetic call.<p><b>on the fifth day of the fourth month</b><br>This specific date is crucial for historical context, as it situates the vision in the Jewish calendar. The fourth month, Tammuz, corresponds to June-July in the Gregorian calendar. This precision underscores the historical reliability of the account and situates it during the Babylonian exile, a period of great turmoil and transformation for the Jewish people.<p><b>while I was among the exiles</b><br>Ezekiel was part of the group of Israelites taken into Babylonian captivity in 597 BC, during the second deportation under King Nebuchadnezzar. This context of exile is essential for understanding the book's themes of judgment and restoration. The exiles were in a foreign land, grappling with the loss of their homeland and temple, which profoundly influenced Ezekiel's message.<p><b>by the River Kebar</b><br>The River Kebar, likely a canal near the city of Nippur in Babylon, was a place where the Jewish exiles settled. Archaeological findings suggest that these canals were part of an extensive irrigation system, indicating the advanced nature of Babylonian infrastructure. This setting highlights the physical and spiritual displacement experienced by the exiles, as they lived in a land of foreign gods and customs.<p><b>the heavens opened</b><br>This phrase signifies a divine revelation, a moment when the barrier between the earthly and the heavenly realms is removed. Such occurrences in Scripture often precede significant prophetic messages or divine interventions (e.g., <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>, <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). The opening of the heavens indicates that what follows is a direct communication from God, underscoring the authority and importance of Ezekiel's vision.<p><b>and I saw visions of God</b><br>Ezekiel's visions are central to his prophetic ministry, providing insight into God's plans and purposes. These visions often contain symbolic imagery and are meant to convey spiritual truths. The phrase "visions of God" suggests a profound encounter with the divine, similar to other prophetic experiences in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>, <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>). These visions reveal God's sovereignty, holiness, and the future restoration of His people, pointing ultimately to the coming of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A priest and prophet, Ezekiel is the central figure in this verse.

Jehoiachin was actually in prison for many years; his people, within certain limits, were free. They were more than <span class= "ital">exiles, </span>but less than prisoners. (On "the heavens were opened," comp. <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Visions of God.</span>--Not merely <span class= "ital">great visions, </span>as the Divine name is often added in Scripture to express greatness or intensity (see <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>, <span class= "ital">marg., </span><a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>, <span class= "ital">marg.; </span><a href="/jonah/3-3.htm" title="So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD.

In <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a> it may point to a connection with the book that precedes it. Here the sequence is subjective. We may think of Ezekiel as retracing the years of his life till he comes to the thirtieth. Then, as it were, he pulls himself up. That must be the starting point of what he has to say. Our English use of "now" is nearly equivalent to this. <span class="cmt_word">In the thirtieth year.</span> I incline, following Origen, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, to refer the date to the prophet's own life. That year in Jewish reckoning was the age of full maturity. At that age the earlier Levites (<a href="/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23, 20, 39, 43, 47</a>) had entered on their duties. It is probable, though no written rule is found, that it was the normal age for the functions of the priesthood. In the case of our Lord (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>) and of the Baptist it appears to have been recognized as the starting point of a prophet's work. Jeremiah's call as a "child" (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; the word may, however, include adult manhood, as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) was obviously exceptional. Other theories are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the years are reckoned from the era of Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar ( <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>), dating from his throwing off the sovereignty of Assyria, and giving here the date <span class="date">B.C. 595</span> (Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Ewald, and others); but against this it may be urged <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that there is no evidence that that era was in use in Ezekiel's time, and <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that he nowhere else uses a double historical chronology.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the thirtieth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
