The term "My children" emphasizes God's claim over the Israelites, indicating that they were His people, set apart for His purposes. This act of slaughtering children was a direct violation of God's commandments and a profound betrayal of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The practice of child sacrifice is condemned in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, where God explicitly forbids such abominations.<p><b>and delivered them up through the fire</b><br>This refers to the ritual of passing children through fire as a form of sacrifice to pagan gods. Archaeological evidence from sites like Carthage shows that such practices were not uncommon in the ancient Near East. The fire symbolizes both the literal flames used in these sacrifices and the consuming nature of idolatry, which demands everything from its followers. This act was not only physically destructive but also spiritually devastating, as it represented a complete turning away from the worship of Yahweh to the worship of false gods. The imagery of fire is often used in the Bible to denote judgment and purification, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>.<p><b>to idols</b><br>Idols represent the false gods that the Israelites turned to, abandoning their exclusive worship of Yahweh. This idolatry was a recurring issue throughout Israel's history, leading to their eventual exile. The worship of idols is condemned throughout the Bible, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>) and the prophetic writings (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). Idolatry is portrayed as spiritual adultery, a theme prevalent in the book of Ezekiel, where God is depicted as a husband betrayed by His unfaithful wife, Israel. This phrase underscores the spiritual blindness and rebellion of the people, who exchanged the glory of the living God for lifeless images.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being addressed in this passage, specifically those in Jerusalem who have turned away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>False gods that the Israelites worshipped, often involving detestable practices such as child sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Referred to as "My children" by God, indicating His deep personal connection and the grievous nature of their sacrifice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire.htm">Fire</a></b><br>Represents the method of sacrifice to idols, a practice condemned by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>God values human life, especially that of children, and sees them as His own.

The verse exposes deliberate, covenant-breaking violence, vividly portraying how idolatry twists parental love into murder. It stands as a sobering reminder that turning from the living God to any rival, ancient or modern, always devalues life and ends in destruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You slaughtered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#353;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7819.htm">Strong's 7819: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slaughter, beat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and delivered them up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tit&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - second person feminine singular &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">through the fire to idols.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 16:21 That you have slain my children (Ezek.
