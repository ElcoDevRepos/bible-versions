It reflects the covenantal relationship where God's protection is contingent upon Israel's faithfulness. The turning away of God's face signifies judgment and abandonment, similar to the language used in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, where God warns of hiding His face due to Israel's idolatry. This withdrawal is a precursor to the coming destruction and exile, emphasizing the seriousness of Israel's sin.<p><b>and they will defile My treasured place</b><br>The "treasured place" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, considered the dwelling place of God and the center of Jewish worship. The defilement of the temple is a profound act of sacrilege, highlighting the depth of Israel's apostasy. Historically, the temple was defiled by idolatrous practices, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-5</a>, where altars to foreign gods were erected. This defilement is both literal and symbolic, representing the nation's spiritual corruption and the loss of God's presence.<p><b>Violent men will enter it</b><br>This phrase predicts the invasion by foreign powers, specifically the Babylonians, who would conquer Jerusalem and desecrate the temple. The term "violent men" underscores the brutality and force with which the invaders would act, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given by Ezekiel and other prophets. This invasion is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>, where God warns of foreign domination as a result of breaking the covenant.<p><b>and they will defile it</b><br>The repetition of defilement emphasizes the complete desecration of the temple, both by the invading forces and by the Israelites' own actions. This act is a fulfillment of prophecy and serves as a type of the ultimate desecration that would occur in the future, as referenced in <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, pointing to the abomination of desolation. The defilement of the temple is a powerful symbol of the broken relationship between God and His people, necessitating eventual restoration and redemption through Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is pronouncing judgment on Israel for their idolatry and rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, now facing judgment due to their persistent sin and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Referred to as "My treasured place," it is the sacred site in Jerusalem where God's presence dwelt among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/robbers.htm">Robbers</a></b><br>Symbolic of the invading forces (likely the Babylonians) who will desecrate the temple, representing God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to separation from God, as seen in His turning away from Israel.
