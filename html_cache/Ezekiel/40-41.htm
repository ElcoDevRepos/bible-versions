This vision, given during the Babylonian exile, outlines a future temple, often interpreted as a prophetic vision of a restored Israel or a symbolic representation of God's perfect order. The gateway is significant as it represents the entrance to a sacred space, emphasizing the importance of preparation and purification before approaching God. The number four often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting a complete provision for the sacrificial system.<p><b>and four outside</b><br>The "four outside" tables indicate that the sacrificial process was not confined to the inner sanctum but extended to the outer areas, possibly to accommodate the large number of offerings. This arrangement reflects the practical needs of temple worship and the accessibility of the sacrificial system to the people. It also underscores the idea that worship and atonement are not limited to a single location but are part of a broader communal and spiritual practice.<p><b>eight tables in all</b><br>The total of "eight tables" signifies abundance and sufficiency in the provision for sacrifices. In biblical numerology, eight can symbolize new beginnings or resurrection, hinting at the renewal and restoration themes present in Ezekiel's vision. This could be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides a new covenant and a new beginning for believers.<p><b>on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered</b><br>The phrase "on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered" highlights the primary function of these tables. Sacrifices were central to the worship practices of ancient Israel, serving as a means of atonement and communion with God. This sacrificial system points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb of God, who fulfills and transcends the Old Testament sacrificial requirements. The act of slaughtering sacrifices on these tables underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement, themes that are central to both the Old and New Testaments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> represents a future place of worship, symbolizing God's presence and the restoration of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gateway.htm">The Gateway</a></b><br>The gateway mentioned in this verse is part of the temple's outer court, where sacrifices are prepared, indicating the importance of proper worship and sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tables.htm">The Tables</a></b><br>These tables are specifically designated for the preparation of sacrifices, highlighting the order and sanctity required in worship practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>Central to the worship practices of Israel, sacrifices symbolize atonement, dedication, and thanksgiving to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/order_in_worship.htm">Order in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple and its furnishings, including the tables for sacrifices, underscores the importance of order and reverence in worship.
