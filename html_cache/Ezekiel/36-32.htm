The context is the restoration of Israel, but God clarifies that His actions are not due to Israel's merit. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God acts for the sake of His name and glory (<a href="/ezekiel/20-44.htm">Ezekiel 20:44</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>). It underscores the idea that God's covenantal faithfulness is rooted in His character rather than human righteousness.<p><b>let it be known to you.</b><br>This serves as a direct address to the Israelites, ensuring they understand the reason behind God's actions. It is a call to recognize and acknowledge God's sovereignty and purposes. This phrase can be seen as a reminder of the importance of understanding God's intentions and the broader narrative of His redemptive plan.<p><b>Be ashamed and disgraced for your ways, O house of Israel!</b><br>Here, God calls Israel to a posture of repentance and humility. The historical context involves Israel's repeated disobedience and idolatry, which led to their exile. This call to shame and disgrace is not merely punitive but is intended to lead to genuine repentance and transformation. It echoes the prophetic tradition of calling God's people to recognize their sinfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/3-25.htm">Jeremiah 3:25</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-7.htm">Daniel 9:7-8</a>).
