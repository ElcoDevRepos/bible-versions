It highlights the distinction between God and man, underscoring Ezekiel's position as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, indicating His role as the ultimate mediator and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>tell the house of Israel</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, God's chosen nation. At this time, they are in exile in Babylon due to their disobedience and idolatry. This phrase indicates that the message is directed to the entire nation, emphasizing the communal aspect of their sin and the need for collective repentance.<p><b>that this is what they have said</b><br>This phrase introduces the people's own acknowledgment of their condition. It shows a moment of self-awareness and reflection, which is crucial for repentance. The acknowledgment of sin is a necessary step in the process of returning to God, as seen throughout the Bible, such as in the confessions of David in the Psalms.<p><b>&#8216;Our transgressions and our sins are heavy upon us</b><br>The people recognize the weight of their sins, which is a common biblical theme. Sin is often depicted as a burden that leads to spiritual and sometimes physical consequences. This acknowledgment is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>, where David speaks of his iniquities as a burden too heavy to bear. It reflects the understanding that sin separates humanity from God and leads to suffering.<p><b>and we are wasting away because of them!</b><br>This phrase indicates the destructive nature of sin, which leads to spiritual decay and death. The imagery of "wasting away" suggests a gradual decline, both physically and spiritually, due to persistent sin. This is consistent with the biblical teaching that sin leads to death, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The people of Israel are experiencing the consequences of their rebellion against God.<p><b>How can we live?&#8217;</b><br>This question reveals a sense of desperation and hopelessness. It is a cry for deliverance and a desire for restoration. The question implies a recognition of the need for divine intervention, as human efforts are insufficient to overcome the consequences of sin. This echoes the biblical theme of seeking life through repentance and turning back to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life is equated with loving and obeying God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Sin&#8217;s heaviness leads to spiritual wasting, driving them to ask, &#8220;How can we live?&#8221; The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s gracious invitation in the next verse: &#8220;Turn, turn from your evil ways!

Now they stand face to face with the fulfillment of the prophet's words. They cherish no hopes, and they make no excuses. They have fallen into the abyss of despair.
