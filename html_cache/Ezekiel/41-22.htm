The dimensions given&#8212;three cubits high and two cubits square&#8212;suggest a modest size, indicating its specific purpose within the temple's inner sanctuary. The use of wood may symbolize the humanity and humility of worship, as wood is a natural, earthly material. This altar's size and material could also reflect the spiritual nature of the offerings made upon it, focusing on the heart rather than the grandeur of the sacrifice. The dimensions also align with the biblical emphasis on order and precision in worship, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle and Solomon's temple (Exodus 25-27, <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>).<p><b>Its corners, base, and sides were of wood.</b><br>The detailed description of the altar's construction emphasizes the uniformity and simplicity of its design. The corners, base, and sides being of wood suggest a cohesive structure, possibly symbolizing the unity and integrity required in worship. In biblical symbolism, corners often represent strength and stability, while the base signifies foundation. This could imply that the altar, though simple, is a stable and foundational element of the temple's worship practices. The use of wood throughout may also point to the altar's role in offerings that are more spiritual or symbolic, rather than physical sacrifices, aligning with the prophetic vision of a renewed covenant relationship with God (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>And the man told me, &#8220;This is the table that is before the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The "man" refers to the angelic guide or divine messenger who leads Ezekiel through the temple vision. His explanation that this altar is "the table that is before the LORD" elevates its significance beyond a mere altar for sacrifices. In biblical terms, a table often signifies fellowship and communion, as seen in the table of showbread in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>). This altar-table could symbolize the intimate relationship between God and His people, where offerings are not just sacrifices but acts of communion and fellowship. The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the altar's placement in the presence of God, highlighting its sacred purpose. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both the ultimate sacrifice and the mediator of the new covenant, bringing believers into direct fellowship with God (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future restoration and the presence of God among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_wood.htm">The Altar of Wood</a></b><br>A specific piece of furniture in the temple vision, symbolizing worship and sacrifice before the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_altar.htm">Symbolism of the Altar</a></b><br>The altar represents worship and sacrifice, central to the relationship between God and His people.

Wood, a living material once rooted in the earth, points to a sacrifice that is connected to everyday human life&#8212;anticipating Christ&#8217;s own physical offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the bronze altar of burnt offerings (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;2</a>), this interior altar suggests communion rather than atonement, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>: &#8220;We have an altar from which those who serve at the tabernacle have no right to eat&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three cubits high</b><p>&#8226;

The altar of burnt offering in Solomon's temple was of brass (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), and in the tabernacle of shittim wood (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>); the altar of incense in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>) and in Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>) was constructed of wood overlaid with gold, but in this temple only of wood. Plumptre, commenting on this, writes, "Possibly Ezekiel shared the feelings of Daniel (Daniel 9:25), that the rebuilding would be 'in troublous times,' and did not contemplate an abundance of gold as likely to be the outcome of the scant offerings of an impoverished people." The dimensions of this altar in the tabernacle were two cubits high and one cubit long and broad; in the Solomonic temple, though not stated, they were probably the same as in the tabernacle; in Ezekiel's temple they were three cubits high, two cubits long (and probably two cubits broad). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar</span> were most likely "the horns, or horn-shaped points projecting at the cornets." <span class="cmt_word">The length.</span> Ewald, Keil, Smend, and others, after the LXX., change into "base," "stand," or "pedestal," on the ground that the length has been already mentioned, and that one does not usually speak of a length being of wood; but it does not strike one as peculiarly objectionable to say that the altar had corner pieces, a length, and walls (or sides) of wood, meaning thereby to intimate that it was wholly constructed of timber. When the prophet's attention had been directed to it, the guide <span class="accented">who</span> accompanied him observed, <span class="cmt_word">This is the table that is before the Lord</span>, not because, as Bottcher conjectured, the altar was regarded as including the table of showbread, but because in the Law the offerings laid upon the altar had been spoken of as the bread of God (see <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 8, 17, 21, 22</a>; and comp. <a href="/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>); and because in this vision table and altar appear to be used inter-changeably (see <a href="/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There was an altar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1441;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;miz&#183;b&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
