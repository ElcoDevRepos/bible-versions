It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator between God and Israel. The term "son of man" is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus to refer to Himself, indicating His role as the representative human and the fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>He said to me,</b><br>This indicates direct communication from God to Ezekiel, emphasizing the personal and authoritative nature of the message. It reflects the prophetic tradition where God speaks directly to His chosen messengers. This divine communication is a hallmark of the prophetic books, where the prophets often begin their messages with "Thus says the Lord."<p><b>&#8220;eat and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you.&#8221;</b><br>The act of eating the scroll symbolizes internalizing God's message. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, eating was often associated with accepting and taking in something fully. The scroll represents God's words, judgments, and prophecies that Ezekiel is to proclaim. This imagery is similar to <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>, where John is also instructed to eat a scroll, indicating the continuity of prophetic symbolism across the scriptures.<p><b>So I ate,</b><br>Ezekiel's obedience in eating the scroll demonstrates his acceptance of God's commission. This act signifies the prophet's readiness to absorb and deliver God's message to the people of Israel. It reflects the necessity for those who speak God's word to first internalize it themselves.<p><b>and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</b><br>The sweetness of the scroll suggests the inherent goodness and truth of God's word, despite the difficult messages it may contain. Honey, often used in the Bible to describe something desirable and pleasant, indicates that God's word is ultimately life-giving and satisfying. This sweetness contrasts with the bitterness of the message's content, which includes judgment and lamentation, highlighting the dual nature of God's word as both sweet and challenging. This duality is echoed in <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>, where God's words are described as sweeter than honey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Such it must always be to those whose high privilege it is to bear God's message to their fellows. He does not expressly add, as St. John does (<a href="/revelation/10-10.htm" title="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.">Revelation 10:10</a>) after a similar first sensation, "as soon as I had eaten it my belly was "bitter;" but it may easily be inferred from <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm" title="So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.">Ezekiel 3:14</a> that such was his experience also, when he went with his heavy message to a people indisposed to give ear. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was in my mouth as honey,</span> etc. The words remind us of <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>; and again of those of Jeremiah in the darkest hour of his ministry (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). They are reproduced yet more closely by St. John (<a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). There is, after the first terror is over, an infinite sweetness in the thought of being a fellow worker with God, of speaking his words and not our own. In the case of St. John, the first sweetness was changed to bitterness as soon as he had eaten it; and this is, perhaps, implied here also in ver. 14. The first ecstatic joy passed away, and the former sense of the awfulness of the work returned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
