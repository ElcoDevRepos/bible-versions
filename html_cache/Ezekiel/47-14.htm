The equal division signifies fairness and God's impartiality. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this allocation is symbolic of the restoration and unity of Israel. Historically, the division of land among the tribes was a significant aspect of Israel's identity, as seen in the book of Joshua. The equal division also reflects the justice and order that God desires for His people.<p><b>Because I swore with an uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's covenantal promise to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The "uplifted hand" is a gesture of solemn oath-taking, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of God's promises. This covenant is foundational to Israel's identity and history, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a> and <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>. It highlights God's faithfulness and the assurance that His promises will be fulfilled despite Israel's past unfaithfulness.<p><b>this land will fall to you as an inheritance.</b><br>The concept of land as an inheritance is central to the identity and theology of Israel. It signifies not only a physical territory but also a spiritual heritage and a fulfillment of God's promises. The land is a tangible sign of God's blessing and faithfulness. In the broader biblical narrative, the inheritance of the land prefigures the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>. This inheritance is both a present reality and a future hope, reflecting the already-but-not-yet aspect of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of the restored land of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob, who are to receive the divided land as an inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God swore to give to the forefathers of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>The patriarchs of Israel, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God made the original promise of the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The land is described as an inheritance, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's covenant promise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God's promise to give the land to the tribes of Israel is a testament to His faithfulness.

Unlike the former division of the laud, the territory is to be arranged in twelve equal portions. This is generally understood to mean that the strips of territory assigned to each tribe shall be of equal width, and such is undoubtedly the prophet's meaning, since the vision throughout makes little account of the natural features of the country. It may be well to notice in passing, however, that the actual area of the territory given to the tribes is thus made very unequal. The country was nearly three times as broad at the south as at the north, and the southern tribes would thus have actually nearly three times as much land as the northern, although they were ideally equal. Were the portions to be made actually equal, the map given under Ezekiel 48 would be much changed. Such an arrangement would move the "oblation" farther south and give it ample room between east and west. Its north line would be a little north of Jerusalem, and its south within ten or twelve miles of Beersheba, and the Temple would be situated a few miles north-west of Hebron and still on the western watershed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall inherit it, one as well as another</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a man as his brother -</span> the customary Hebrew phrase for "equally" (see, however, <a href="/2_samuel/11-25.htm">2 Samuel 11:25</a>). The equal participants were to be tribes, not the families, as in the Mosaic distribution (<a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>). Had the earlier principle of allotment been indicated as that to be followed in the future, it would not have been possible to give the tribes equal portions, as some tribes would certainly have a larger number of families than others. Nevertheless, the division was to be equal among the tribes, which shows it was rather of an ideal than of an actual distribution the prophet was speaking. Then what they should divide amongst themselves was to be the land concerning which Jehovah had <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his hand</span> - a peculiarly Ezekelian phrase (see <a href="/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15, 23, 28, 42</a>), signifying "to swear" (comp. <a href="/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>:40) - to give it unto their fathers (see <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>). That the land was not divided after this fashion among the tribes that returned from exile is one more attestation that the prophet's directions were not intended to be literally carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to divide</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
