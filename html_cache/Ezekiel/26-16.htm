The "princes of the sea" symbolize the rulers and influential figures of these coastal regions. The act of descending from their thrones signifies a loss of power and status, indicating the profound impact of Tyre's downfall on its allies and trading partners. Historically, Tyre was a major hub in the ancient Near East, and its destruction would have sent shockwaves through the region.<p><b>remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments</b><br>The removal of robes and embroidered garments is a symbolic act of mourning and humiliation. In ancient cultures, clothing often represented one's status and identity. By discarding these garments, the princes express their grief and acknowledge the loss of their own prestige and security. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where clothing is used to signify mourning or repentance, such as in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>.<p><b>Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground</b><br>Being "clothed with terror" suggests that fear and dread have become their new attire, replacing their former garments of splendor. Sitting on the ground is a traditional posture of mourning and despair, seen in other biblical contexts like <a href="/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>. This posture indicates a complete reversal of fortune and a recognition of their vulnerability in the face of divine judgment.<p><b>trembling every moment, appalled over you</b><br>The continuous trembling reflects an ongoing state of fear and anxiety, highlighting the severity of the situation. The word "appalled" suggests a deep sense of shock and horror at the destruction of Tyre. This reaction underscores the magnitude of Tyre's fall, which serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and reliance on wealth. The prophetic nature of this passage aligns with other biblical prophecies where God judges nations for their arrogance and idolatry, such as in <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a> and <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
