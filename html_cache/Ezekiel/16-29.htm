Chaldea, part of Babylon, was a powerful empire, and Israel's political and spiritual entanglements with it symbolize a departure from reliance on God. Historically, Chaldea was renowned for its merchants and trade, which often led to idolatry and moral corruption. This reflects Israel's tendency to seek security and prosperity through worldly means rather than trusting in God.<p><b>the land of merchants</b><br>Chaldea's reputation as a land of merchants underscores its economic influence and the temptation it posed to Israel. The pursuit of wealth and material gain often led to spiritual compromise. This mirrors the warnings in Proverbs about the dangers of greed and the love of money. The focus on commerce also connects to <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon is depicted as a symbol of economic and spiritual corruption, ultimately facing divine judgment.<p><b>but even with this you were not satisfied!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the insatiable nature of Israel's spiritual adultery. Despite forming alliances and adopting practices from powerful nations like Chaldea, Israel remained unfulfilled. This reflects the biblical theme that turning away from God to pursue worldly desires leads to emptiness and dissatisfaction. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> echo this sentiment, illustrating the futility of seeking fulfillment outside of a relationship with God.

Thence it became extended over the whole land. It is thought by some writers to revert here to its original meaning, and be equivalent to the low, flat land. The expression will become clearer if translated, "the Canaan land Chaldaea." The word, however, bears also the meaning of traffic, commerce (<a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm" title="Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-7.htm" title="He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm" title="Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.">Zephaniah 1:11</a>), and in this sense is applied to Babylon in <a href="/ezekiel/17-4.htm" title="He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.">Ezekiel 17:4</a>, and this is the better meaning here. The idea will then be that Israel, beginning its idolatries in the actual Canaan, had extended them along with her commercial intercourse on every side, until at last she had carried them even to Chaldaea, the great commercial emporium of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Canaan,</span> etc. The words at first seem to give the nearest and furthest points of the intercourse of Israel with foreign nations. I incline, however, with Smend and the margin of the Revised Version, to take Canaan in its secondary sense as "the land of traffick," Chaldea being in apposition with it (comp. <a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>, for a like use of the Hebrew word).
