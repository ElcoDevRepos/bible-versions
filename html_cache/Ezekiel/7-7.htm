The term "doom" indicates an inevitable and severe judgment, reflecting God's response to persistent sin and rebellion. The "inhabitants of the land" refers specifically to the people of Judah, who are facing the consequences of their idolatry and disobedience. This echoes the warnings given by earlier prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>The time has come;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of the impending judgment. It suggests that the period of warning and opportunity for repentance has ended. The prophetic message is urgent, indicating that the fulfillment of God's word is at hand. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's patience eventually giving way to justice, as seen in other prophetic books like Amos and Joel.<p><b>the day is near;</b><br>"The day" refers to the "Day of the Lord," a concept found throughout the prophetic literature, symbolizing a time of divine intervention and judgment. It is a day of reckoning for the wicked and a time of vindication for the righteous. The nearness of this day underscores the urgency of the message and the need for the people to recognize the seriousness of their situation.<p><b>there is panic on the mountains</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize places of refuge and strength. However, in this context, they become places of fear and panic, indicating that no place is safe from God's judgment. This imagery contrasts with the usual perception of mountains as stable and secure, highlighting the totality of the coming disaster. It reflects the chaos and fear that accompany divine judgment, as seen in other prophetic visions, such as those in Isaiah and Revelation.<p><b>instead of shouts of joy.</b><br>This phrase contrasts the expected sounds of celebration and victory with the reality of fear and despair. It suggests a reversal of fortune, where anticipated blessings are replaced by calamity. This reversal is a common theme in prophetic literature, where the consequences of sin lead to unexpected and tragic outcomes. The absence of joy underscores the severity of the judgment and the loss of God's favor, reminiscent of the lamentations over Jerusalem's fall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_land.htm">Inhabitants of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Judah who are facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>A significant theme in prophetic literature, representing a time of divine judgment and reckoning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Often symbolic in biblical literature, here they represent places of false worship and idolatry, now sites of panic.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where Judah faced destruction and exile due to their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>God's warnings through His prophets are certain and should be taken seriously.

Instead of this shall be the tumult (rather the trouble) of the day of war. (See the opposite contrast in <a href="/context/exodus/32-17.htm" title="And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.">Exodus 32:17-18</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The morning is come unto thee,</span> etc. In the only other passage in which the Hebrew noun occurs (<a href="/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>), it is translated "diadem," the meaning being strictly a circular ornament. Here the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span>, something twirled, out of which may come the meaning of the changes of fortune. Possibly, as in the familiar "wheel of fortune," that thought was involved in the circular form by itself. In the Tahnud it appears as the name of the goddess of fate at Ascalon (Furst). On the whole, I follow the Revised Version, Keil, and Ewald, in giving "thy doom." The "morning" of the Authorized Version probably rises from the thought that the dawn is, as it were, the glory and diadem of the day. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">contritio. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The day of trouble</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">of tumult.</span> The word is specially used of the noise of war (<a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not the sounding again upon the mountains.</span> The first noun is not found in the Old Testament, but a closely allied form appears in <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, for the song of the vintage.
