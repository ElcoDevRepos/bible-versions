The "sword" is a common biblical metaphor for war and divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6-7</a>). Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, but it faced numerous invasions, including those by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, which aligns with Ezekiel's prophecies. This judgment serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>and there will be anguish in Cush</b><br>Cush, often identified with the region south of Egypt, including parts of modern-day Sudan, had close political and economic ties with Egypt. The anguish in Cush reflects the ripple effect of Egypt's downfall on its allies and neighbors. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics and the widespread impact of divine judgment. Cush's distress underscores the theme of God's judgment extending beyond a single nation.<p><b>when the slain fall in Egypt</b><br>The imagery of the slain falling in Egypt emphasizes the severity of the coming destruction. It points to a time of great loss and defeat, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given by Ezekiel. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>its wealth is taken away</b><br>Egypt was known for its immense wealth, accumulated through trade, agriculture, and conquest. The taking away of its wealth signifies not only economic ruin but also the stripping away of its power and influence. This aligns with the biblical principle that material wealth is fleeting and can be easily lost (<a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a>). The loss of wealth serves as a humbling act of divine judgment.<p><b>and its foundations are torn down</b><br>The tearing down of foundations symbolizes the complete overthrow and destabilization of Egypt. Foundations represent stability and strength, and their destruction indicates a total collapse. This imagery is consistent with other biblical prophecies where God dismantles the pride and security of nations (<a href="/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19:1-15</a>). It serves as a warning of the futility of relying on human strength and the ultimate triumph of God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's people.
