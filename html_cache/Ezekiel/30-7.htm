The term "desolate" indicates a state of utter ruin and abandonment, often used in the Old Testament to describe divine judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this prophecy is directed against Egypt, a nation that had been a significant power in the ancient Near East. The desolation is not just physical but also symbolic of the loss of power and influence. Historically, Egypt had been a land of wealth and prosperity, but this prophecy foretells a reversal of fortune. The phrase "among desolate lands" suggests that Egypt's fate will be similar to other nations judged by God, such as Assyria and Babylon, which also faced destruction due to their pride and idolatry.<p><b>and their cities will lie among ruined cities</b><br>The mention of "cities" highlights the urban centers of Egypt, which were the heart of its civilization and culture. Cities like Memphis and Thebes were known for their grandeur and were central to Egyptian identity. The prophecy that these cities will "lie among ruined cities" underscores the totality of the destruction. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against nations that oppose His will. The imagery of ruined cities serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of the final judgment, where all earthly powers are brought low before the sovereignty of God. The desolation of these cities also prefigures the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, where earthly powers are replaced by the eternal city of God, as seen in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.
