The guide's role is to provide insight and understanding, similar to the angelic guides in other prophetic books like Daniel. This guidance emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the vision.<p><b>to the outer gate of the sanctuary</b><br>The outer gate is part of the temple complex described in Ezekiel's vision, which is a detailed blueprint of a future temple. This gate is significant as it represents access to the sacred space. The temple's design reflects the holiness and order of God's dwelling place, reminiscent of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple.<p><b>that faced east</b><br>The east-facing gate holds symbolic importance, as the east is often associated with the presence and glory of God. In biblical tradition, the east is where the sun rises, symbolizing new beginnings and divine revelation. The Garden of Eden was placed in the east, and the glory of the Lord entered the temple from the east in <a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>.<p><b>but it was shut</b><br>The closed gate signifies a restriction on access, symbolizing the holiness and exclusivity of God's presence. This closure is prophetic, pointing to the future when the gate will remain shut because the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered through it (<a href="/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2</a>). It underscores the sanctity of God's dwelling and the need for reverence.
