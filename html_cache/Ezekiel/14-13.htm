It is used over 90 times in the book of Ezekiel. The term "Son of Man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is frequently used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>if a land sins against Me by acting unfaithfully</b><br>The concept of a land sinning reflects the collective responsibility of a nation or people group. Acting unfaithfully implies a breach of covenant, as Israel was in a covenant relationship with God. This echoes the Deuteronomic blessings and curses (Deuteronomy 28), where faithfulness leads to blessings and unfaithfulness to curses. The historical context includes Israel's idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which were seen as acts of unfaithfulness.<p><b>and I stretch out My hand against it</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention and judgment. The imagery of God stretching out His hand is used throughout the Old Testament to signify His power and authority to execute judgment (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>). It underscores God's active role in responding to sin.<p><b>to cut off its supply of food</b><br>Famine is a common form of divine judgment in the Bible, often used to bring a nation to repentance. In the ancient Near East, agriculture was the backbone of society, and cutting off food supply would lead to severe consequences. This reflects the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>, where disobedience results in agricultural failure.<p><b>to send famine upon it</b><br>Famine is not only a physical hardship but also a spiritual wake-up call. It serves as a reminder of human dependence on God for sustenance. In biblical history, famines often led people to seek God, as seen in the story of Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 41) and the famine during the time of Elijah (1 Kings 17).<p><b>and to cut off from it both man and beast</b><br>The inclusion of both man and beast highlights the comprehensive nature of the judgment. It reflects the interconnectedness of creation, where human sin affects the entire ecosystem. This is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where both humans and animals suffered (<a href="/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>). It also points to the ultimate restoration of creation, where harmony will be restored (<a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the one receiving God's message.
