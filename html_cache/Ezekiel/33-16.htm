In the context of Ezekiel, the prophet is addressing the exiles in Babylon, urging them to turn from their wicked ways. The idea that past sins can be forgiven is consistent with the broader biblical narrative of repentance and grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>. Theologically, this reflects God's justice and mercy, where genuine repentance leads to a clean slate. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, which speaks of confession and forgiveness.<p><b>He has done what is just and right;</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of righteous living as evidence of true repentance. In the historical context of ancient Israel, justice and righteousness were central to the covenant relationship between God and His people. The Law, given through Moses, outlined what was considered just and right, and the prophets often called the people back to these standards. This call to justice and righteousness is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. It also prefigures the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the spirit of the law and the importance of inner righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>).<p><b>he will surely live.</b><br>The assurance of life here is both literal and spiritual. In the immediate context, it refers to the promise of physical life and restoration for those who turn from their sins. This is particularly poignant for the exiles, who faced the consequences of national disobedience. Spiritually, it points to eternal life, a theme that is developed more fully in the New Testament. Jesus Christ, as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets, offers eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). This promise of life is a central tenet of Christian faith, symbolizing the ultimate victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in exile due to their disobedience and sin against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>A period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks through Ezekiel, offering both judgment and hope for repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_repentant_sinner.htm">The Repentant Sinner</a></b><br>The individual who turns from sin and does what is just and right, as described in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a complete turning away from sin and a commitment to live righteously.
