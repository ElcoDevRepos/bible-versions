The "path" indicates the sinful practices and idolatry that both cities engaged in, which led to their downfall. Historically, Samaria fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC due to its unfaithfulness to God, serving as a warning to Jerusalem. The concept of following a path is often used in Scripture to denote a lifestyle or pattern of behavior, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>, which warns against following the path of the wicked.<p><b>I will put her cup into your hand.</b><br>The "cup" is a metaphor for experiencing the same judgment and wrath that befell Samaria. In biblical literature, a cup often symbolizes God's judgment or wrath, as seen in <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>. The imagery of drinking from a cup is used to convey the inevitability and completeness of experiencing God's judgment. This phrase underscores the certainty of Jerusalem's impending punishment due to its mirrored sins. The cup metaphor is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the cup of suffering He must drink (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), highlighting the theme of divine judgment and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.
