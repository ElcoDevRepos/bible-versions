Historically, this is understood to be the Babylonians, known for their brutality and idolatry. The Babylonians were used by God as instruments of His wrath, fulfilling prophecies of judgment against Israel for their disobedience and idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using pagan nations to discipline His people, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-7</a>.<p><b>to take possession of their houses.</b><br>The seizure of houses symbolizes the complete overthrow and displacement of the Israelites. In ancient Near Eastern culture, losing one's home was a sign of total defeat and humiliation. This aligns with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to foreigners inhabiting the Israelites' homes. It underscores the severity of God's judgment and the loss of security and identity for the people of Israel.<p><b>I will end the pride of the mighty,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's opposition to human arrogance and self-reliance. The "mighty" likely refers to the leaders and warriors of Israel who trusted in their own strength rather than in God. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction," and serves as a warning against the dangers of pride. It also foreshadows the humbling of all nations before God, as seen in the eschatological visions of Revelation.<p><b>and their holy places will be profaned.</b><br>The desecration of holy places, including the temple in Jerusalem, signifies the depth of Israel's spiritual decline and the seriousness of their sin. The temple, once the dwelling place of God's presence, becomes defiled, illustrating the consequences of idolatry and unfaithfulness. This event prefigures the ultimate cleansing and restoration through Christ, who declared Himself the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and points to the future hope of a new, undefiled creation in <a href="/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel prophesied, facing judgment due to their idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_wicked_of_nations.htm">The Most Wicked of Nations</a></b><br>Likely referring to the Babylonians, who were used by God as instruments of judgment against Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty.htm">The Mighty</a></b><br>The leaders and influential figures in Israel who were prideful and led the nation away from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_places.htm">Holy Places</a></b><br>The sacred sites in Israel, including the temple, which were defiled due to the nation's sin and subsequent judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God uses nations and events to fulfill His purposes.
