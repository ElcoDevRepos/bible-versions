The mention of "daughters" refers to the surrounding towns or people associated with Sodom. The concept of restoration here is significant, as it suggests a reversal of judgment and a return to a state of blessing. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's mercy and willingness to forgive, even those who have fallen far from His grace. Theologically, it underscores the theme of redemption and the possibility of renewal for all, regardless of past transgressions.<p><b>as well as Samaria and her daughters</b><br>Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC due to idolatry and disobedience (2 Kings 17). The "daughters" again refer to the surrounding towns or people. The inclusion of Samaria highlights the theme of God's impartiality in judgment and restoration. It serves as a reminder of the divided kingdom and the consequences of turning away from God. The restoration of Samaria signifies hope for the reunification and healing of God's people, pointing to a future where divisions are reconciled.<p><b>And I will restore you along with them</b><br>This phrase addresses Jerusalem, the primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecy. The promise of restoration "along with them" indicates that Jerusalem, despite its own sins and the resulting Babylonian exile, will also experience God's mercy. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of exile and return, emphasizing God's covenant faithfulness. The restoration of Jerusalem is a prophetic foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who brings reconciliation and restoration to all humanity. It highlights the inclusivity of God's salvation plan, extending grace to both the historically sinful and the chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom.htm">Sodom</a></b><br>An ancient city known for its wickedness, destroyed by God as a judgment for its sins.

The "bringing again of captivity "does not, indeed, necessarily mean a return from exile (into which Sodom had not been carried); but, as explained in <a href="/ezekiel/16-55.htm" title="When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.">Ezekiel 16:55</a>, a return to the former estate, that is, a state of happiness and prosperity. In the case of Sodom this was manifestly impossible; and even in the case of Samaria it would, if accomplished, lack any historical identification. Sodom and her daughters (the surrounding cities) had perished with all their inhabitants many ages ago, leaving no descendants behind. Restoration was, therefore, obviously impossible; and by conditioning the restoration of Jerusalem on an impossible thing, it is meant to be most strongly denied.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall bring again</span>; better, with the Revised Version, both here and in ver. 55, <span class="accented">and I will turn again.</span> The Authorized Version reads like a sentence of hopeless and perpetual condemnation, as <span class="accented">per impossible.</span> When Sodom and Samaria should be pardoned, then, and not till then, should there be hope for Judah. But all that follows in the chapter shows that what is meant is a promise of restoration, not for Judah only, but also for her less guilty sisters. Ezekiel sees a far off hope for his own nation, and he cannot limit the mercy of God in bringing them also, as she was to be brought, to repentance. For them also punishment was a means to an end beyond itself, corrective, and not merely retributive. The language of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/19-23.htm">Isaiah 19:23</a>-2.5) as to Egypt and Assyria presents a striking parallel, and may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I will restore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#7687;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
