In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their persistent sin and rebellion against God. The call to turn from wickedness is a central theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting God's desire for repentance rather than punishment (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>). The Hebrew concept of "turning" (shuv) implies a complete change of direction, akin to the New Testament call to repentance (metanoia). This reflects God's consistent character throughout Scripture, as seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the father's acceptance of the repentant son mirrors God's willingness to forgive.<p><b>and does what is just and right</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of not only turning away from sin but also actively pursuing righteousness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, justice and righteousness were foundational to societal stability and were often linked with covenant faithfulness. The call to do what is just and right is echoed in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God requires His people to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. This reflects the moral and ethical standards that God expects from His people, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and justice as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>he will save his life</b><br>This phrase promises life as a result of repentance and righteous living. In the historical context of Ezekiel, "life" often referred to both physical survival and spiritual well-being. The assurance of life is a recurring theme in the Bible, where obedience to God's commands leads to blessings and life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where eternal life is promised to those who believe in Jesus Christ and follow His teachings (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The idea of salvation through repentance and righteous living is a precursor to the New Testament doctrine of salvation by grace through faith, which produces good works as evidence of genuine faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who have lived in sin but have the opportunity to repent and change their ways.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, they were in exile due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, symbolizing a period of judgment and reflection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>A central theme in this passage, highlighting the transformative power of turning away from sin and towards righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a complete turning away from sin and a commitment to live according to God's standards.
