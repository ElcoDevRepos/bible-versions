In ancient Near Eastern architecture, windows in gateways were not only functional for illumination but also served as a means of surveillance and security. This design reflects the importance of vigilance and transparency in the temple, symbolizing spiritual watchfulness. The windows may also represent the eyes of God, who sees all things, as referenced in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, "The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good."<p><b>like the other windows</b><br>This phrase indicates uniformity and consistency in the temple's design, emphasizing order and divine perfection. The repetition of similar architectural features throughout the temple complex underscores the meticulous planning and divine inspiration behind the structure. This consistency can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging nature, as stated in <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, "For I the LORD do not change."<p><b>It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide</b><br>The specific dimensions of the gateway and portico highlight the precision and grandeur of the temple's construction. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, makes the gateway about 75 feet long and 37.5 feet wide. These measurements indicate a significant and imposing structure, befitting the house of God. The use of precise measurements is reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the construction of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>, emphasizing the importance of following God's exact specifications. The dimensions also reflect the temple's role as a place of order and divine presence, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is described as the cornerstone in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>, bringing together the spiritual temple of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inner_court.htm">The Inner Court</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex in Ezekiel's vision, representing a place of worship and communion with God, symbolizing holiness and separation from the profane.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_portico.htm">The Portico</a></b><br>An architectural feature of the temple, serving as an entrance or a transitional space, often associated with grandeur and reverence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palm_trees.htm">Palm Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic decorations on the pillars, representing victory, peace, and eternal life, often used in biblical imagery to convey prosperity and divine blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/windows.htm">Windows</a></b><br>Architectural elements that allow light into the temple, symbolizing spiritual illumination and the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_temple.htm">Symbolism of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple in Ezekiel's vision symbolizes God's presence among His people.

Jesus later says, &#8220;I am the gate; whoever enters through Me will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), showing how every real doorway in God&#8217;s house ultimately prefigures the Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its portico</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and its portico &#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The portico (porch) extends the welcome of the gateway while still marking sacred space.
