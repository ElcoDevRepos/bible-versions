The worship of idols and detestable images was a significant issue, leading to the nation's downfall and exile. The term "defile" indicates a spiritual impurity that separates the people from God. The promise of no longer defiling themselves suggests a future transformation and purification, aligning with prophecies of a renewed covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). This transformation is often seen as a type of the sanctification process in the life of a believer, where the Holy Spirit enables a turning away from sin.<p><b>or with any of their transgressions</b><br>Transgressions refer to the broader category of sins and violations of God's law. Historically, Israel's transgressions included social injustices, neglect of the Sabbath, and failure to uphold the covenant. This phrase emphasizes a comprehensive cleansing from all forms of sin, not just idolatry. It points to a holistic redemption and restoration, which is a theme echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' sacrifice is seen as atoning for all sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>I will save them from all their apostasies by which they sinned</b><br>Apostasy, the act of abandoning one's faith, was a critical issue for Israel, leading to their exile. God's promise to save them from apostasies indicates a divine intervention to restore faithfulness. This salvation is not just physical but spiritual, suggesting a future where God will ensure their loyalty. This can be connected to the New Testament promise of eternal security for believers (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>), where God preserves His people from falling away.<p><b>and I will cleanse them</b><br>Cleansing is a significant biblical motif, symbolizing purification from sin. In the Old Testament, ritual cleansing was necessary for worship (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>). Here, the cleansing is spiritual, indicating a removal of sin's stain. This foreshadows the New Testament concept of being washed by the blood of Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>), where believers are made pure and righteous before God.<p><b>Then they will be My people, and I will be their God</b><br>This covenantal language echoes God's promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) and is a central theme throughout Scripture. It signifies a restored relationship between God and His people, characterized by mutual belonging and commitment. This phrase finds its ultimate fulfillment in the New Testament, where believers, both Jew and Gentile, are grafted into God's family through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>). It points to the eschatological hope of <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God dwells with His people eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.

Their sins were rather committed in their own land; the "lands of their captivity" were the places where those sins were punished. "Their dwelling places" is then to be understood of their own land of Canaan, where they had been led into idolatry and all abominations by the heathen dwelling among them; and the promise is that this land shall be purged, that all evil shall be cast out from it, and the people delivered from the temptations by which they had hitherto been overcome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dwelling-places wherein they have sinned</span>, from which Jehovah premises to save them, are in accordance with the views expressed above, not, as Hengstenberg and Hitzig conjecture, the dwelling-places of the exile in which the people then were, but the dwelling-places in Canaan in which they had formerly transgressed, but would in future be preserved from transgressing. The idea is, as Schroder suggests, the localization of transgression which is viewed as proceeding from the dwelling-places in which it is committed; or, according to Plumptre, the conception is that, as their habitations had formerly been contaminated by their detestable things, "the worship of teraphim and such like, if not worse," so Jehovah would save them from that contamination.
