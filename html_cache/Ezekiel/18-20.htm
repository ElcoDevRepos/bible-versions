In the context of the Babylonian exile, many Israelites believed they were suffering for the sins of their ancestors. Ezekiel refutes this, asserting that each person is accountable for their own actions. This principle aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that children should not be put to death for their parents' sins. Theologically, this underscores the justice of God, who judges each person based on their own deeds. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, where the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ.<p><b>A son will not bear the iniquity of his father,</b><br>This phrase highlights the shift from collective to individual responsibility. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family and tribal identity often dictated one's fate, but Ezekiel emphasizes personal accountability. This is a radical departure from the generational curses mentioned in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, showing a development in the understanding of justice. It also reflects God's fairness and mercy, ensuring that each person has the opportunity to repent and seek righteousness without being burdened by their ancestors' sins.<p><b>and a father will not bear the iniquity of his son.</b><br>Here, the principle of individual responsibility is further reinforced. This phrase assures that parents are not held accountable for their children's sins, promoting a sense of personal moral agency. It reflects the fairness of God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29-30</a>, where it is stated that everyone will die for their own sin. This teaching encourages personal repentance and transformation, aligning with the New Testament call for individuals to turn to Christ for salvation.<p><b>The righteousness of the righteous man will fall upon him,</b><br>This phrase affirms that righteousness is rewarded on an individual basis. In the historical context, this was a message of hope for the exiled Israelites, encouraging them to pursue personal holiness despite their circumstances. It connects to the broader biblical theme that God rewards those who seek Him, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>. This principle also points to the ultimate righteousness found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers His righteousness to believers.<p><b>and the wickedness of the wicked man will fall upon him.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the certainty of divine justice. Wickedness leads to consequences, reinforcing the idea that each person is responsible for their own actions. This is consistent with the biblical teaching that God is just and will not let the guilty go unpunished, as seen in <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>. It serves as a warning to turn from sin and seek God's mercy, which is fully revealed in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness and new life to those who repent and believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
