It echoes the parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>, where the shepherd leaves the ninety-nine to find the one lost sheep. This demonstrates God's relentless love and desire for reconciliation with His people. Historically, Israel often strayed from God's commandments, and this promise reassures them of God's commitment to restore them.<p><b>bring back the strays</b><br>The imagery of bringing back strays highlights God's role as a shepherd who actively seeks to restore those who have wandered. In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the Israelites who were exiled and scattered due to their disobedience. This action is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises, emphasizing His faithfulness despite Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>bind up the broken</b><br>Binding up the broken signifies healing and restoration. In ancient times, shepherds would tend to the wounds of their sheep, symbolizing care and compassion. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, which speaks of God healing the brokenhearted. It points to God's restorative power and His concern for the well-being of His people.<p><b>and strengthen the weak</b><br>Strengthening the weak indicates God's empowerment and support for those who are vulnerable. This can be seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives strength to the weary. It reflects God's provision and sustenance, ensuring that His people are equipped to face challenges.<p><b>but the sleek and strong I will destroy</b><br>This phrase contrasts God's treatment of the humble and the proud. The "sleek and strong" represent those who are self-reliant and oppressive, often at the expense of others. In the context of Ezekiel, this could refer to corrupt leaders or nations that exploit the weak. God's justice involves bringing down the proud and exalting the humble, as seen in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>.<p><b>I will shepherd them with justice.</b><br>God's role as a shepherd is central to this passage, emphasizing His leadership and care. Shepherding with justice means ruling with fairness and righteousness, ensuring that all are treated equitably. This is a messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who embodies perfect justice and care for His flock, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

He seeks, restores, heals, and empowers vulnerable sheep while dismantling the proud who exploit others. Every action flows from His just, compassionate character, fully revealed in Christ&#8212;our Shepherd who pursues the lost, gathers the straying, mends the broken, strengthens the weak, confronts the arrogant, and rules with unwavering justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The fat and the strong.</span>--While fatness is in general an emblem of prosperity, it is frequently used in Scripture, as here, for that prosperity which begets hardness of heart and forgetfulness of God. (See <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="/acts/28-27.htm" title="For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.">Acts 28:27</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">With judgment.--</span>This does not mean, as the ambiguous sense of the English word might make it possible to suppose, <span class= "ital">with wisdom,</span> but with righteousness and authority, as is plainly seen from the connection with the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will destroy the fat and the strong</span>. What follows introduces another feature into the parable, and is hardly less than an anticipation of the great scene of judgment in <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>. The "fat and the strong," as contrasted with the "broken" and the "sick," are, when we interpret the Darable, the noble and wealthy who, under the kings of Judah, had been allowed to work their evil will upon the people. Of these he says that <span class="cmt_word">he will feed them with</span> (better, in) <span class="cmt_word">judgment</span>, that for them there must be the discipline of punishment. They too are his sheep, but they require a different treatment from the others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will seek</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the lost,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1489;&#1462;&#1444;&#1491;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7687;e&#183;&#7695;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
