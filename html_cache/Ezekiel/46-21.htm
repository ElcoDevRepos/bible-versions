The outer court in the temple vision represents the area accessible to the general populace, symbolizing the inclusivity of God's presence. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this court is part of the eschatological temple, which some interpret as a future literal temple, while others see it as a symbolic representation of God's ultimate plan for His people. The outer court's accessibility can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament's message of salvation being available to all through Christ.<p><b>and led me around to its four corners</b><br>The act of being led to the four corners of the court emphasizes the thoroughness of the vision and the completeness of God's plan. The number four often symbolizes universality in biblical literature, suggesting that God's presence and judgment extend to the entire earth. This can be connected to the four corners of the earth mentioned in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>, indicating the global reach of God's sovereignty. The detailed exploration of the temple's structure highlights the importance of order and precision in God's design.<p><b>and I saw a separate court in each of its corners</b><br>The presence of a separate court in each corner of the outer court suggests designated areas for specific purposes, possibly related to the sacrificial system or other temple functions. This separation can be seen as a reflection of the holiness and order required in worship practices. In historical and cultural context, the temple served as the center of religious life for the Israelites, and its detailed layout underscores the importance of approaching God with reverence and obedience. The separate courts may also symbolize the different roles and responsibilities within the community of believers, each contributing to the overall function of the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of visions from God, including the vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_outer_court.htm">The Outer Court</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex described in Ezekiel's vision, representing a place of worship and gathering for the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_corners.htm">Four Corners</a></b><br>Symbolic of completeness and universality, the four corners of the court suggest the encompassing nature of God's presence and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/separate_court.htm">Separate Court</a></b><br>These courts in each corner may symbolize areas designated for specific purposes, reflecting order and structure in worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_temple.htm">The Vision of the Temple</a></b><br>This vision, given to Ezekiel, outlines a future temple, emphasizing God's holiness and the restoration of proper worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_sacred_space.htm">The Importance of Sacred Space</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple's courts underscores the significance of having dedicated spaces for worship and communion with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_order_and_structure.htm">God's Order and Structure</a></b><br>The separate courts in each corner reflect God's desire for order and purpose in worship, encouraging believers to approach God with reverence and intentionality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_worship.htm">Inclusivity in Worship</a></b><br>The outer court's accessibility to all people symbolizes the inclusive nature of God's invitation to worship, reminding us of the call to welcome all into the community of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_completeness.htm">Symbolism of Completeness</a></b><br>The four corners represent completeness, reminding us of God's all-encompassing presence and the wholeness found in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_restoration.htm">Anticipation of Restoration</a></b><br>Ezekiel's vision points to a future restoration, encouraging believers to hope in God's promise of renewal and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_46_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 46:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_21_God_s_order_in_worship.htm">How does Ezekiel 46:21 illustrate God's order in worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Outer_court_s_four_corners_significance.htm">What significance do the "four corners of the outer court" hold?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_sacred_space_in_church_today.htm">How can we apply the principles of sacred space in our church today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_21_vs_OT_temple_guidelines.htm">What connections exist between Ezekiel 46:21 and other Old Testament temple instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_21_God_s_holiness_reverence.htm">How does understanding Ezekiel 46:21 enhance our reverence for God's holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_four_courts_important_in_Ezekiel.htm">What is the significance of the four courts in Ezekiel 46:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_21_s_link_to_temple_rites.htm">How does Ezekiel 46:21 relate to temple worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Ezekiel_46_21.htm">What historical evidence supports the description in Ezekiel 46:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_46.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_ezekiel_40's_details.htm">How should one reconcile the detailed architectural descriptions in Ezekiel 40 with the absence of any clear historical record of its fulfillment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_there_temple_ruins_with_separate_gates.htm">Ezekiel 46:9 mandates worshipers to enter and exit by different gates;

This last word is omitted in the LXX. and the Vulgate, Hitzig, and Smend, the <span class="accented">puncta extraordinaria</span> showing that the Massorites regarded it as suspicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he brought me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the outer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1510;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2435.htm">Strong's 2435: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, wall side, exterior, secular</span><br /><br /><span class="word">court</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and led me around to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1428;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;r&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">corners,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4740.htm">Strong's 4740: </a> </span><span class="str2">A corner buttress</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
