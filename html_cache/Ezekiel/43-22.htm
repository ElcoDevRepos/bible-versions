The second day follows the initial consecration of the altar, highlighting the ongoing nature of purification and dedication in the temple service. This reflects the meticulous attention to detail in the Levitical laws and the importance of continual sanctification.<p><b>you are to present an unblemished male goat</b><br>The requirement for an "unblemished male goat" underscores the necessity for purity and perfection in offerings to God. In the Old Testament, animals used for sacrifices had to be without defect, symbolizing the holiness and perfection required by God. The male goat as a sin offering is significant, as goats were often used in sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-24</a>). This points to the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement. The unblemished nature of the goat prefigures Christ, who is described as the Lamb without blemish or defect (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and restore the relationship between the people and God. This offering highlights the gravity of sin and the need for a substitute to bear the penalty. The sin offering in Ezekiel's vision points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p><b>and the altar is to be cleansed</b><br>Cleansing the altar signifies the removal of impurity and the preparation of a holy space for worship. This act of cleansing is essential for maintaining the sanctity of the altar, which is the focal point of sacrificial worship. The cleansing process reflects the broader biblical theme of purification and the need for holiness in approaching God (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>).<p><b>as it was with the bull</b><br>This phrase refers back to the initial consecration ritual involving a bull, as described earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43</a>. The bull, a larger and more valuable animal, was used for the initial purification, indicating the significance of the altar's sanctification. The repetition of the cleansing process with the goat reinforces the thoroughness required in the purification rites. This mirrors the repeated sacrifices in the Old Testament, which were ultimately fulfilled in the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving God's instructions regarding the temple and its rituals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Central to the temple worship, the altar is where sacrifices are made.
