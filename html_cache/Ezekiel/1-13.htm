Fire in the Bible often symbolizes God's presence, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire that guided the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The living creatures, identified as cherubim in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, are associated with God's throne and His glory. The fire signifies purification and judgment, reflecting God's holiness and the consuming nature of His presence (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p><b>Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures;</b><br>The movement of fire between the living creatures indicates dynamic activity and the constant presence of God's power. This movement can be seen as a representation of God's omnipresence and His active involvement in the world. The back-and-forth motion suggests a continuous and unending energy, similar to the perpetual worship and service of the heavenly beings described in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>. It also emphasizes the unity and harmony among the creatures, as they are part of a divine order.<p><b>it was bright,</b><br>The brightness of the fire highlights the glory and majesty of God. Light is often associated with God's revelation and truth (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>). The brightness signifies the clarity and purity of God's presence, which illuminates and exposes all things. This brightness is a reflection of God's unapproachable light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>) and serves as a reminder of His transcendence and the awe-inspiring nature of His glory.<p><b>and lightning flashed out of it.</b><br>The flashing lightning represents the power and might of God. Lightning is frequently used in Scripture to depict God's voice and His actions (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/psalms/29-7.htm">Psalm 29:7</a>). It conveys the idea of suddenness and the overwhelming force of God's intervention in human affairs. The lightning also serves as a warning of impending judgment, as seen in the prophetic visions of Revelation (<a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>). This imagery underscores the fearsome and awe-inspiring aspects of God's presence, reminding believers of His sovereignty and authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of the living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are angelic beings, often identified as cherubim, that appear in Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing God's presence and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire_and_lightning.htm">Fire and Lightning</a></b><br>Elements in the vision that represent God's holiness, purity, and the dynamic nature of His presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_purity.htm">God's Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The fire among the living creatures symbolizes God's holiness.

Ezekiel could find no single word to express his meaning, and has therefore given two, that between them the idea of the fiery brilliancy may be better conveyed.<p><span class= "bld">It went up and down.</span>--" It" refers to the fire. This indescribable fiery appearance went up and down among the living creatures, "bright" in itself, and throwing out coruscations of "lightning."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like burning coals of fire, etc</span>. It may not be amiss to note the fact that the phrase throughout the Bible denotes incandescent wood. The nearest approach to its use by Ezekiel is in <a href="/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 13</a>. For "lamps," read, with the Revised Version, "torches." Here the vision of Ezekiel, in which the living creatures were thus incandescent, bathed, as it were, in the fire that played around them, yet not consumed, followed in the path of previous symbols - of the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), of the pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>), of the fire on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), of the "fire of the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>), and the "fire of God" (<a href="/2_kings/1-12.htm">2 Kings 1:12</a>). Speaking generally, "fire," as distinct from "light," seems to be the symbol of the power of God as manifested against evil. "Our God is a consuming Fire" (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).
