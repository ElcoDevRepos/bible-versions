This auditory experience emphasizes the importance of the message and the authority of the vision. In the context of Ezekiel's visions, hearing is as significant as seeing, as it underscores the communication between God and His prophet. The "wheels" refer to the complex vision of the divine chariot seen in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, symbolizing God's omnipresence and mobility. The wheels are part of the cherubim's structure, representing the divine throne and God's ability to move and act throughout the earth.<p><b>&#8220;the whirling wheels.&#8221;</b><br>The term "whirling" suggests constant motion and energy, reflecting the dynamic nature of God's presence and actions. This imagery of movement can be connected to the idea of God's sovereignty and His active involvement in the world. The wheels' ability to move in any direction without turning signifies God's omniscience and omnipotence. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the vision of the throne in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where God's majesty and authority are similarly depicted. The wheels' motion also symbolizes the unfolding of God's plans and judgments, as seen throughout the book of Ezekiel, where God's presence moves from the temple, indicating judgment and eventual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wheels.htm">The Wheels</a></b><br>Part of the vision of God's glory, these wheels are associated with the cherubim and represent divine movement and presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cherubim.htm">The Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings that accompany the glory of God, often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The setting of Ezekiel's vision, representing the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice.htm">The Voice</a></b><br>The divine voice that Ezekiel hears, emphasizing the authority and power of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_presence.htm">God's Sovereignty and Presence</a></b><br>The vision of the wheels and cherubim underscores God's omnipresence and sovereign control over all creation.
