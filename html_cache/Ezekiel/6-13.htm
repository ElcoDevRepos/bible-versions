The recognition of God as LORD is a central goal of His judgments and blessings. This echoes the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where God desires His people to acknowledge Him as their sole deity (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>).<p><b>when their slain lie among their idols</b><br>The imagery of the slain lying among their idols highlights the futility and impotence of idol worship. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, idols were often seen as protectors, yet here they are powerless to save. This serves as a stark contrast to the living God who has power over life and death (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>).<p><b>around their altars</b><br>Altars were central to worship practices, often used for sacrifices and offerings. The presence of the slain around these altars signifies the judgment upon false worship. This is reminiscent of the showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, where the true God demonstrated His power (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>).<p><b>on every high hill</b><br>High places were commonly used for idol worship in ancient Israel and surrounding nations. These locations were chosen for their elevation, believed to be closer to the divine. The condemnation of these sites is frequent in the Old Testament, as they were often associated with pagan practices (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-11</a>).<p><b>on all the mountaintops</b><br>Mountaintops, like high hills, were seen as sacred spaces in many ancient cultures. The use of these sites for idol worship was a direct violation of God's command to worship Him alone. The judgment upon these places underscores the exclusivity of worship that God demands (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>and under every green tree and leafy oak</b><br>Trees, particularly oaks, were often associated with fertility cults and pagan rituals. The reference to these locations indicates the widespread nature of idolatry among the people. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the pervasive unfaithfulness of Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p><b>the places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols</b><br>Incense was a common element in worship, symbolizing prayers and offerings to deities. The use of incense in idol worship is condemned as it represents a misdirected devotion that belongs to God alone. This practice is contrasted with the incense offerings prescribed in the worship of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in rebellion against Him, engaging in idolatry and other sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that the Israelites turned to instead of the one true God, often associated with pagan practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_hills_and_mountaintops.htm">High Hills and Mountaintops</a></b><br>Common locations for idol worship in ancient Near Eastern cultures, symbolizing places of false worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/green_tree_and_leafy_oak.htm">Green Tree and Leafy Oak</a></b><br>Natural settings often used for pagan rituals, representing the allure and pervasiveness of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognition of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The phrase "And you will know that I am the LORD" emphasizes God's ultimate authority and the certainty of His judgment.

The words "sweet savour" are constantly applied to the commanded sacrifices to the Lord, and are here used ironically of the idol sacrifices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The thought is the same as in ver. 6, but the localities are given in greater detail. The "hills" and "mountains" were naturally the scenes of the worship of the "high places," and these were commonly associated with groves of trees, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>. In <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>, oaks (or terebinths), poplars, and elms are specifically named (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Where they did offer sweet savour,</span> etc. The phrase is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel as a priest (<a href="/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28, 41</a>), and is specially prominent in the books which he must have studied. It meets us three times in Exodus, seventeen in Leviticus, seventeen in Numbers, and seldom elsewhere. The crowning sin, from the prophet's point of view, was that the incense which was due to Jehovah had been lavished on the false gods of the nations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then you will know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
