It underscores Ezekiel's role as a representative of humanity, chosen to deliver God's messages. The term "son of man" is also used in the New Testament, particularly in reference to Jesus Christ, highlighting His incarnation and role as the mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>pose a riddle</b><br>Riddles in the biblical context often contain hidden meanings or truths that require discernment to understand. This method of communication is used to engage the audience, prompting them to think deeply about the message. In the ancient Near East, riddles were a common form of teaching, often used to convey wisdom or moral lessons. Here, the riddle serves as a vehicle for divine revelation, challenging the listeners to seek understanding.<p><b>speak a parable</b><br>Parables are simple stories used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. In the Bible, they are often employed to reveal truths about God's kingdom in a way that is accessible yet profound. Jesus frequently used parables in His teachings, and Ezekiel's use of a parable here aligns with this tradition, providing a narrative that conveys deeper spiritual truths about Israel's situation and God's plans.<p><b>to the house of Israel</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, God's chosen nation. At this time, Israel was in exile, facing the consequences of their disobedience and idolatry. The message is directed to them as a call to repentance and understanding of their current plight. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting themes of judgment, redemption, and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Israel during their exile in Babylon.

These literary forms both conceal and reveal, demanding humble inquiry while exposing rebellion. The passage sets the stage for a vivid prophecy that interprets current events through God&#8217;s unchanging covenant faithfulness, urging Israel&#8212;and every reader&#8212;to heed His authoritative, trustworthy word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">A riddle . . .</span> <span class= "bld">a parable.</span>--What the prophet has to say is called a riddle as well as a parable, because there is something in it recondite and obscure--something which, until it is explained, should excite the minds of the people to guess its meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put forth a riddle,</span> etc. Again there is an interval of silence, till another theme is suggested to the prophet's mind and worked out elaborately.

It will task the ingenuity of his hearers or readers to interpret it, and so he subjoins (vers. 12-24) the interpretation. That interpretation enables us to fix the occasion and the date of the prophecy.
