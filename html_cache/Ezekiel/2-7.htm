This directive emphasizes the role of a prophet as a mouthpiece for God, highlighting the divine authority behind the message. The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's command, regardless of the audience's reception. This mirrors the call of other prophets, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>), who were also instructed to speak God's words faithfully.<p><b>whether they listen or refuse to listen</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the potential rejection of the message by the audience. It reflects the persistent rebellion of Israel, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The prophet's duty is to deliver the message, not to ensure its acceptance, similar to the parable of the sower in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>), where the sower spreads the seed regardless of the type of soil. This highlights the sovereignty of God in the process of revelation and response.<p><b>for they are rebellious</b><br>The Israelites are described as rebellious, a recurring characterization in the prophetic books. This rebellion is not just against the prophet but against God Himself. Historically, this rebellion can be traced back to the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>) and continued through the monarchy and into the exile. The term "rebellious" also connects to the broader biblical narrative of humanity's rebellion against God, which is ultimately addressed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed where humanity failed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Faithfulness means sticking to Scripture even when it collides with prevailing opinions.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a> reinforces the principle: &#8220;If anyone speaks, he should speak as one conveying the words of God&#8221;.
