Historically, Israel has faced numerous invasions, but this prophecy points to a significant eschatological event. The term "My people" underscores God's covenant relationship with Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a> and <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>.<p><b>like a cloud covering the land.</b><br>The imagery of a cloud suggests a vast, overwhelming force, emphasizing the scale and intensity of the invasion. This metaphor is used elsewhere in scripture to describe large armies or divine presence, such as in <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>. It conveys the idea of an impending threat that is both unavoidable and all-encompassing.<p><b>It will happen in the latter days,</b><br>"Latter days" is a term often associated with end-times prophecy, indicating events that will occur in the eschatological future. This phrase connects to other prophetic scriptures, such as <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a> and <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, which also speak of events in the "latter days," pointing to a culmination of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>O Gog,</b><br>Gog is a leader or symbolic figure representing a coalition of nations opposed to Israel. The identity of Gog has been debated, with some interpretations linking it to historical figures or regions, while others see it as a future antagonist. The name Gog appears in <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>, suggesting a typological connection to end-times opposition against God's people.<p><b>that I will bring you against My land,</b><br>This phrase indicates divine sovereignty, as God Himself orchestrates the events for His purposes. The land is referred to as "My land," emphasizing God's ownership and covenant promise to Israel. This aligns with passages like <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>, where God declares the land belongs to Him.<p><b>so that the nations may know Me</b><br>The purpose of this event is revelatory, aiming to demonstrate God's power and holiness to the nations. This theme of God revealing Himself to the nations is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, as seen in <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>, where God's actions serve to make His name known globally.<p><b>when I show Myself holy in you before their eyes.</b><br>God's holiness is a central theme, and this event serves to vindicate His holiness before the world. The phrase suggests a public demonstration of God's character and justice, similar to how God's holiness was revealed in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's holiness through Jesus Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or figure representing a coalition of nations that will come against Israel.
