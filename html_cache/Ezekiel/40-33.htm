The consistency in measurements reflects the meticulous nature of God's instructions, similar to the detailed specifications given for the Tabernacle in Exodus. The gate chambers and side pillars were likely used for administrative or ceremonial purposes, emphasizing the organized structure of worship. The portico, a covered entrance, signifies a place of transition from the outside world into the sacred space, symbolizing the passage from the profane to the holy.<p><b>Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around.</b><br>The presence of windows suggests openness and light, symbolizing spiritual illumination and the presence of God. In ancient architecture, windows were often narrow openings that allowed light while maintaining security. This design could represent the balance between divine revelation and protection. The windows all around may also indicate the omnipresence of God, as light is a common biblical metaphor for God's presence and truth (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>).<p><b>It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</b><br>The specific dimensions highlight the grandeur and significance of the temple structure. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, makes the gate about 75 feet long and 37.5 feet wide, indicating a substantial and imposing entrance. These measurements reflect the majesty and glory of God's dwelling place. The use of precise measurements is reminiscent of the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple, underscoring the importance of following God's exact commands. The dimensions also suggest a sense of proportion and harmony, which are characteristics of divine order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
