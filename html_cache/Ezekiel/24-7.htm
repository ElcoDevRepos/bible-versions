In biblical context, bloodshed often signifies violence and injustice, which were rampant in Jerusalem at the time. The imagery of blood being "still within her" suggests that the city has not sought atonement or repentance for its sins. This can be connected to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where Abel's blood cries out from the ground, indicating that God is aware of injustice and holds people accountable.<p><b>she poured it out on the bare rock;</b><br>Pouring blood on a bare rock instead of the ground signifies a blatant and shameless display of sin. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, blood was considered sacred and was typically covered with dust to show respect and to prevent defilement (<a href="/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13</a>). The act of pouring it on a rock indicates a public and unrepentant attitude towards sin, highlighting the people's disregard for God's laws and the sanctity of life.<p><b>she did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the failure to follow the proper ritual of covering blood with dust, as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13</a>. Covering blood with dust was a way to show respect for life and acknowledge the seriousness of taking a life. By not doing so, the people of Jerusalem demonstrate their contempt for divine commandments and their lack of remorse. This act of defiance is a metaphor for their spiritual state, showing a hardened heart and a refusal to seek forgiveness. The imagery also foreshadows the judgment that will come upon them, as their sins are exposed and unatoned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
