These creatures are symbolic of God's majesty and power, often associated with His divine presence. The number four may represent universality, as it is frequently used in Scripture to denote completeness (e.g., four corners of the earth). The living creatures are also seen in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, indicating their role in the heavenly realm. Their presence within the vision signifies the holiness and sovereignty of God, as cherubim are often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, such as the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>).<p><b>And this was their appearance:</b><br>The description of the living creatures' appearance is detailed and symbolic, emphasizing their otherworldly nature. The vivid imagery serves to convey the awe-inspiring and mysterious aspects of God's creation. The appearance of these creatures is not meant to be understood literally but rather as a representation of divine attributes and functions. The detailed description underscores the importance of the vision and the message Ezekiel is about to receive.<p><b>They had a human form,</b><br>The human form of the living creatures suggests intelligence, will, and the ability to communicate, reflecting the image of God in humanity (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>). This anthropomorphic aspect highlights the connection between the divine and human realms, as well as the role of these creatures as intermediaries between God and His people. The human form also points to the incarnation of Christ, who took on human flesh to dwell among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This aspect of the vision foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus, who bridges the gap between heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of the four living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_living_creatures.htm">Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>Mysterious beings that appear in Ezekiel's vision, each having a human form but with unique features that symbolize various aspects of God's creation and attributes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Ezekiel receives his visions.

Now, peering into that storm, he sees something definite, &#8220;the form.&#8221;<p>&#8226;The scene assures us that God&#8217;s glory is not chaotic; amid the fiery turmoil there is order and purpose (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226;The &#8220;form&#8221; points to real beings God created, not mere symbols. Scripture consistently portrays heavenly beings as actual servants who carry out God&#8217;s will (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226;Just as God spoke to Job &#8220;out of the whirlwind&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>), He now reveals Himself to Ezekiel. The storm clouds of judgment will soon break over Judah, yet inside them stands a controlled, holy presence&#8212;God is never out of command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of four living creatures</b><p>Ezekiel immediately counts &#8220;four.&#8221; In Scripture, four often conveys completeness in relation to the created world&#8212;four directions, four corners of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226;These beings are later identified as cherubim (<a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15, 20</a>), the same order posted at Eden&#8217;s gate (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and depicted overshadowing the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>).<p>&#8226;The word &#8220;living&#8221; underlines vitality. Around God there is life in abundance; nothing is static or lifeless (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226;Their number suggests that every quarter of creation is under God&#8217;s surveillance.

God condescends to make His glory understandable (<a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5-7</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They had a human form</b><p>Though awe-inspiring, the creatures resemble people in overall shape.<p>&#8226;Human likeness signals that angels, while distinct, share enough commonality to serve as intermediaries between God and mankind (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).<p>&#8226;It also underscores humanity&#8217;s unique place in creation: we are made &#8220;in Our image, after Our likeness&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). The highest angelic order mirrors that design, highlighting the dignity God has bestowed on people.<p>&#8226;Their upright posture implies readiness to act; they are not reclining but prepared for service (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226;When John sees similar beings around God&#8217;s throne, he, too, notes traits familiar to humans alongside supernatural features (<a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7-8</a>).

The word "likeness" is not without significance. The prophet would make it plain that this was a vision, that these were symbolic, not actually existing creatures. Their prominent characteristic is that they were "living." This word is used over and over again in connection with them (see <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-13.htm" title="As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.">Ezekiel 1:13-15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm" title="And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.">Ezekiel 1:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm" title="When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.">Ezekiel 1:21</a>, &c.); and in fact, in Ezekiel and Revelation (<a href="/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, &c., where it is mis-translated <span class= "ital">beasts</span>) it occurs nearly thirty times. The same characteristic is further emphasized in <a href="/ezekiel/1-14.htm" title="And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.">Ezekiel 1:14</a> by the speed, "as of a flash of lightning," with which they "ran and returned," by the multiplicity of eyes in the wheels connected with them (<a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>), and by their going instantly "whithersoever the spirit was to go" (<a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm" title="Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.">Ezekiel 1:20</a>); while in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a> it is said that "they rest not day and night." Their life is represented as most closely connected with the source of all life, the "living God," whose throne is seen in the vision (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) as above the heads of these "living creatures," . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of four living creatures.</span> The Authorized Version is happier here in its rendering than in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, where we find "beasts" applied to the analogues of the forms of Ezekiel's vision.

What he sees is, in fact, a highly complicated development of the cherubic symbols, which might well appear strange to him. It is possible (as Dean Stanley and others have suggested) that the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, the winged bulls and lions with human heads, which Ezekiel may have seen in his exile, were elements in that development. <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of a man.</span> This apparently was the first impression.
