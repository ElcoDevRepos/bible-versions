The employment of men for this task reflects the seriousness and the scale of the aftermath of the battle. In biblical context, this can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, where the land must be purified from the defilement of the dead. The idea of cleansing the land is consistent with the Levitical laws concerning purity (<a href="/leviticus/11-32.htm">Leviticus 11:32-40</a>).<p><b>to cleanse it by burying the invaders who remain on the ground.</b><br>The act of burying the dead is significant in Jewish culture, as leaving bodies unburied was considered a curse and a defilement of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>). This cleansing process is not just physical but also spiritual, as it restores the land to a state of purity. The invaders mentioned are likely the forces of Gog, as described earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a>, representing the enemies of God's people. This burial signifies the finality of God's victory over these forces.<p><b>At the end of the seven months</b><br>The specific mention of "seven months" is symbolic, as the number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible. This period indicates a thorough and complete process of cleansing. It also suggests a time of reflection and transition from judgment to restoration. The duration underscores the magnitude of the destruction and the need for a significant period to address it.<p><b>they will begin their search.</b><br>The search implies a diligent and careful effort to ensure that no remains are left unburied, highlighting the importance of thoroughness in the cleansing process. This search can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance and the need to address all aspects of sin and defilement. It also connects to the broader theme of restoration and renewal found throughout the prophetic books, where God restores His people and their land after judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

It implies that this occupation is to be one of long continuance, and the fact that they are to search the land through for the remains shows that the army of Gog is not conceived of as perishing when collected in one place, but when distributed all over the land.

It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both "passengers," in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and "buffers," from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the "passengers," i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of the seven months of burying. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/39-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
