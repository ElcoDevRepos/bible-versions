In the context of Ezekiel's ministry, he was tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, who were in exile in Babylon. This highlights the importance of prophetic communication in the Old Testament, where God often used prophets to convey His will and warnings to His people.<p><b>&#8216;As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD,</b><br>This oath-like statement underscores the certainty and seriousness of God's declaration. The phrase "as surely as I live" is a divine assurance, reflecting God's eternal nature and His ultimate authority. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His active involvement in the affairs of humanity. This expression is used elsewhere in Scripture to affirm the truth of God's promises and judgments (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,</b><br>Here, God's character is revealed as compassionate and merciful. Despite the wickedness of humanity, God's desire is not for destruction but for repentance and restoration. This aligns with other biblical passages that emphasize God's patience and willingness to forgive (e.g., <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). It challenges the misconception that God is eager to punish, instead highlighting His longing for redemption.<p><b>but rather that the wicked should turn from their ways and live.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the concept of repentance, a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. The call to "turn" signifies a change of direction, moving away from sin and towards God. The promise of life for those who repent is consistent with the biblical narrative of salvation and restoration. This reflects the heart of the Gospel message, where repentance leads to life through Jesus Christ (e.g., <a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3</a>, <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><b>Turn! Turn from your evil ways!</b><br>The repetition of "turn" underscores the urgency and importance of repentance. It is a passionate plea from God, reflecting His deep desire for His people to abandon their sinful behaviors. This call to action is a common prophetic theme, urging immediate response to avoid impending judgment. It echoes the calls of other prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who also urged Israel to return to God.<p><b>For why should you die, O house of Israel?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the senselessness of choosing death over life. It reflects God's lament over the stubbornness of His people, who persist in sin despite the offer of life. The "house of Israel" refers to the collective nation, emphasizing the communal aspect of sin and repentance. This question is a poignant reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's offer of salvation, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

God lays life and death before His people and pleads for the sensible choice (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart: He is a living, speaking God who mourns over sin but joyfully offers life to any who repent. Judgment is certain for the unrepentant, yet entirely avoidable through turning to Him. The passage summons every reader to heed the watchman&#8217;s warning, abandon evil, and embrace the life God longs to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">I have no pleasure.--</span>Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/18-28.htm" title="Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm" title="For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, said the Lord GOD: why turn yourselves, and live you.">Ezekiel 18:32</a>. Ezekiel meets the despair of the people by the assurance, long before given in another connection, that the Creator and Father of all can have no pleasure in the death of any, and adds an earnest exhortation to repentance that they may be saved. Yet it was very important that there should be no misunderstanding in regard to the basis of acceptance with God, and the prophet therefore, in the following verses (12-20). briefly reiterates the teaching of Ezekiel 18 in regard to the individual responsibility of every one for himself before God. This teaching has already been explained under Ezekiel 18.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say unto them</span>, etc. To meet that despair the prophet has to fall back on the truth which he had proclaimed once before (<a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>). He must appear as uttering a message of pardon resting on the unchanging character of the great Absolver. Now, as ever, it is true that he willeth not the death of the wicked, that all punishment (in this world, at least) is meant to lead to repentance, and that for those who repent there is the hope of restoration and of life. No righteousness in the past avails against the transgression of the present (Ver. 12); but then also no wickedness of the past prevails to shut out the penitent's claim to pardon. As a man is at any given moment, when the judgment comes on him, so is he dealt with. In some sense, as in Ver. 13, the righteousness of the post may become a stumbling-block. The man may trust in it, and be off his guard, ceasing to watch and pray, and so the temptation may prevail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
