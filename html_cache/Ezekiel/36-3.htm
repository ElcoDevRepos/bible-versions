Prophecy in the Old Testament often served as a direct communication from God to His people, providing guidance, warning, or comfort. The authority of the message is underscored by the phrase "the Lord GOD says," emphasizing that the words are not Ezekiel's own but are from Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God of Israel. This reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, a theme consistent throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you on every side,</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the condition of the land of Israel, which has been left desolate and ravaged by surrounding nations. Historically, this refers to the invasions and destruction brought by foreign powers such as the Babylonians. The imagery of being "trampled on every side" suggests total devastation and humiliation, a common fate for conquered lands in the ancient Near East. This desolation is a consequence of Israel's disobedience and the resulting judgment, as outlined in earlier chapters of Ezekiel.<p><b>so that you became a possession of the rest of the nations</b><br>The land of Israel, once a symbol of God's promise and blessing, has become a spoil for other nations. This reflects the historical reality of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were removed from their land, and it was occupied by others. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the consequences of breaking the covenant with God, as the land was a central element of the Abrahamic promise. The possession by other nations also foreshadows the eventual restoration and the hope that God will reclaim and restore His people and their land.<p><b>and were taken up in slander by the lips of their talkers,</b><br>The phrase highlights the ridicule and scorn faced by Israel from other nations. In the ancient world, the defeat of a nation was often seen as the defeat of its gods, leading to mockery and slander. This reflects the cultural context where the honor of a people was closely tied to their land and their deity. The slander also points to the spiritual battle, as the nations' mockery of Israel is ultimately a challenge to the power and faithfulness of Yahweh. This theme of vindication is echoed in other prophetic writings, where God promises to restore His name and His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The verse lays the groundwork for the stunning promises that follow (36:4&#8211;15): God will reverse the desolation, reclaim the land from foreign hands, and turn slander into praise.

In the previous clause the words, "have swallowed you up," should rather be "pant for you," the word being taken from the snuffing and panting of wild beasts. It was after this fashion that "the residue of the heathen," all those whom the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar had yet left, panted for the possession of the lands of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. Ewald calls attention to the fivefold repetition of this conjunction, saying, "It repeats itself five times, the reasons [for God's judgments] against these enemies thrusting themselves forward, before the discourse calmly dwells upon the mountains of Israel, of which it is strictly intended to treat." As it were, the prophet's emotion is so strong, and his indignation against Israel's enemies so vehement, that, though he three times in succession begins to prophesy to the mountains of Israel, he on each occasion breaks off before he can get his message told, to expatiate upon the wickedness of Israel's foes. In the prophet's estimation that wickedness was so heinous as to inevitably carry in its bosom appropriate retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> - literally, <span class="accented">because and because</span>, or <span class="accented">even because</span>, a reduplication for the sake of emphasis, as in <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> - <span class="cmt_word">they have made you desolate</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and swallowed you up on every side</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wasting of and panting after you</span> (are) <span class="accented">round about</span>.

Keil sees in "the tongue" a personification for the "tongue-man" or talker of <a href="/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>; and Gesenius considers the two clauses as tautological. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prophesy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and declare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
