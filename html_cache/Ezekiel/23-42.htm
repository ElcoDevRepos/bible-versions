The carefree nature of the crowd indicates a lack of concern for moral or spiritual matters, reflecting the spiritual adultery of Israel and Judah. This mirrors the behavior condemned in <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, where people indulge in feasting and revelry without regard for impending judgment.<p><b>Drunkards were brought in from the desert</b><br>The mention of "drunkards" highlights the moral decay and lack of restraint among the people. The desert, often a place of desolation and wandering, symbolizes spiritual barrenness. This imagery may also connect to the nomadic tribes or outsiders who were not part of the covenant community, emphasizing the mingling with those who do not know God, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>.<p><b>along with men from the rabble,</b><br>The "rabble" refers to a disorderly crowd, often associated with lower social status or those outside the covenant community. This inclusion of the rabble signifies the extent of Israel and Judah's unfaithfulness, as they align themselves with those who do not uphold God's laws. This is reminiscent of the mixed multitude that left Egypt with the Israelites, who later became a source of trouble (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>, <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>).<p><b>who put bracelets on your wrists</b><br>Bracelets were often symbols of wealth, status, or allegiance in ancient cultures. The act of placing bracelets on wrists can symbolize a binding agreement or covenant, albeit a corrupt one in this context. This act may also reflect the seductive allure of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, where Israel is adorned with jewelry in pursuit of false gods.<p><b>and beautiful crowns on your head.</b><br>Crowns symbolize authority, honor, and sometimes divine favor. In this context, the "beautiful crowns" may represent the false sense of glory and power that comes from alliances with pagan nations and idolatrous practices. This is a counterfeit to the true honor and authority that comes from God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>, where believers are promised the crown of life for their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/carefree_crowd.htm">Carefree Crowd</a></b><br>This refers to a group of people engaged in revelry and indulgence, symbolizing the moral and spiritual decay of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabeans.htm">Sabeans</a></b><br>A people from the desert, possibly from the region of Sheba, known for their wealth and trade.

The phrase translated "with her" is rendered "thereby" in <a href="/genesis/24-14.htm" title="And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness to my master.">Genesis 24:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Men of the common sort </span>is better rendered in the margin, <span class= "ital">the multitude of men; </span>and "Sabeans" is not a proper name, but, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">drunkards. </span>They are represented as from the wilderness, not as their home, but as the region through which they passed in marching to Judaea. The whole sense of the verse is that the conquerors attacking the land were satisfied with heavy tribute, and having received this, many of the warriors gave themselves up to drunkenness and debauchery, decking out their tributary with meretricious ornaments. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice of a multitude</span>, etc. The word for "multitude" is strictly tumult, and Keil and Currey render, The voice of tumult became still," <span class="accented">sc</span>. the threats of the alien powers whom Judah courted were for a time hushed by the tributes thus paid to them. <span class="cmt_word">With the men of the common sort</span>; literally, as in the margin, of <span class="accented">the multitude of men</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Sabeans from the wilderness</span>.

"Sabeans" rests on a Jewish rendering of the text, but, as a people, the Sabeans, who dwelt south of Meroe, though named in <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, were too remote to come within the horizon of the parable. What Ezekiel dwells on is the ever-growing degradation of the harlot city. Not only the officers of the Chaldeans, but the mixed multitude, the very drunkards from the wilderness of Babylon, were admitted to her embraces. Possibly the word may point to the false gods to whom libations of wine were offered, but I incline to refer it rather to those who got drunk at their idol-festivals even in Jerusalem. Drunkenness was one of the vices of the Babylonians, and the prophets, who admired the Rechabites and the Nazarites (<a href="/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>; <a href="/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>), must have looked on Judah's participation in that sin as a measureless degradation. <span class="cmt_word">The bracelets and crowns</span> symbolize the wealth and prestige which the Chaldean alliance was supposed to bring with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sound</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
