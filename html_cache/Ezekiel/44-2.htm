Throughout the book, Ezekiel receives visions and messages from God, emphasizing the authority and authenticity of the prophecy. This divine communication underscores the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>&#8220;This gate is to remain shut.</b><br>The gate referred to is the Eastern Gate of the temple, also known as the Golden Gate. In the context of Ezekiel's vision of the new temple, this gate holds significant symbolic meaning. The closure of the gate signifies a divine decree, emphasizing the holiness and sanctity of the space it protects.<p><b>It shall not be opened,</b><br>The permanent closure of the gate symbolizes the finality and unchangeable nature of God's decision. This can be seen as a representation of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His purposes. The closed gate also serves as a reminder of the sacredness of God's presence.<p><b>and no man shall enter through it,</b><br>This restriction highlights the exclusivity of God's holiness. It signifies that no human effort or authority can alter what God has established. The closed gate serves as a boundary between the divine and the profane, emphasizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin.<p><b>because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the gate was once used by God Himself, marking it as a place of divine presence. The entry of the LORD through the gate signifies His acceptance and occupation of the temple. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate manifestation of God's presence among His people.<p><b>Therefore it will remain shut.</b><br>The finality of the gate's closure is reiterated, emphasizing the enduring nature of God's decree. This closure can be seen as a prophetic symbol of the messianic fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who entered Jerusalem through the Eastern Gate, fulfilling the prophecy of the coming King. The closed gate serves as a reminder of the completed work of Christ and the anticipation of His return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, including the vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is depicted as having entered through the gate, signifying His presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eastern_gate.htm">The Eastern Gate</a></b><br>A specific gate of the temple in Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing the entrance of God's glory and presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for Israel, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_new_temple.htm">The Vision of the New Temple</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Ezekiel, symbolizing restoration and the future hope for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_god.htm">Holiness of God</a></b><br>The closed gate signifies the holiness and exclusivity of God's presence.

The closed gate similarly signals that human activity must yield to divine glory.<p>&#8226; God often marks boundaries around holy places&#8212;Sinai was fenced off (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>), the Most Holy Place was separated by a veil (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Revelation shows gates that never close because God&#8217;s glory fully permeates the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>). Here, the shut gate highlights the present distinction between Creator and creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it</b><p>The prohibition is absolute.<p>&#8226; Uzzah&#8217;s fate for touching the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>) and King Uzziah&#8217;s leprosy for entering the sanctuary (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>) illustrate the peril of violating holy space.<p>&#8226; &#8220;No man can see Me and live&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The closed gate dramatizes that truth.<p>&#8226; The restriction also preserves a single, unrepeatable moment&#8212;God&#8217;s entrance. Like the sealed tomb stone that could not be kept closed once Christ rose (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>), this sealed gate testifies permanently to a past act of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it.

God Himself has passed through.<p>&#8226; His glory returned to the temple by this very gate (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-5</a>), reversing the devastating departure of chapter 10.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7-10</a> personifies gates lifting for the &#8220;King of Glory,&#8221; yet once He has entered, the entrance stands as a monument to His supremacy.<p>&#8226; Jesus applies temple imagery to Himself: &#8220;I am the gate; whoever enters through Me will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). There is one way to God, and once He has provided it, no alternative route remains.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a> explains that the veil&#8212;another barrier&#8212;was torn by the sacrifice of Christ, giving believers bold access.
