It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the words are not from the prophet himself but from God. This establishes the seriousness and certainty of the prophecy.<p><b>&#8216;When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered,</b><br>This refers to the regathering of the Israelites, a recurring theme in prophetic literature. Historically, the Israelites were scattered due to invasions and exiles, notably by the Assyrians and Babylonians. This gathering is seen as a future event, often associated with the Messianic age, where God will restore Israel to its land. It reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>I will show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations.</b><br>God's holiness is demonstrated through His actions, particularly in fulfilling His promises. The regathering of Israel serves as a testament to God's power and faithfulness, witnessed by other nations. This act of restoration is not just for Israel's benefit but also to reveal God's character to the world, aligning with the theme of God's glory being recognized universally.<p><b>Then they will dwell in their own land,</b><br>This promise of dwelling in their own land is significant, as land is a central aspect of God's covenant with Israel. It signifies peace, security, and divine blessing. Historically, the land of Israel is a tangible sign of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>which I have given to My servant Jacob.</b><br>The reference to Jacob connects the promise to the patriarchal covenant. Jacob, later named Israel, is the father of the twelve tribes. This phrase underscores the continuity of God's promises from the patriarchs to the future restoration of Israel.

The judgment upon Judah had already come, in the fall of their holy city and the captivity of the people. This leads them to repentance, and thus God is "sanctified in the sight of the heathen;" His holiness and justice are exhibited to the world. Then comes the promise of the return, and the judgment of the ungodly enemies who have despised Judah (<a href="/ezekiel/28-26.htm" title="And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments on all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.">Ezekiel 28:26</a>). This, too, shall be accomplished in its time, and then peace and prosperity shall return to Israel.<p>The immediate point of this prophecy is the return of the Jews to their own land; yet, as the struggle between them and their enemies has been a struggle between the Church of God and the powers of the world, and as this particular struggle thus in some sort symbolises the greater contest between religion and the world in all ages, so this promise of rest looks forward in some sense to the final victory over all evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servant Jacob</span>.
