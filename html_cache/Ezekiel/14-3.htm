It highlights the distinction between the divine and human, underscoring Ezekiel's position as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. The title is also used extensively in the New Testament, particularly by Jesus, to refer to Himself, indicating His role as the representative human and the fulfillment of prophetic roles.<p><b>these men have set up idols in their hearts</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, often involving physical idols. However, this phrase indicates a deeper, internalized form of idolatry. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. By setting up idols in their hearts, these men have allowed their devotion to be corrupted from within, prioritizing other desires or entities over God. This internal idolatry is akin to the warnings in the New Testament about the love of money or other desires that can take precedence over God (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><b>and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces</b><br>A stumbling block refers to anything that causes someone to sin or fall away from faith. In this context, the wicked stumbling blocks are the consequences of their idolatry, leading them away from God and into sin. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to describe actions or beliefs that lead to spiritual downfall (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>). The placement "before their faces" suggests a deliberate choice to engage with these sinful practices, making it difficult to see or follow God's path.<p><b>Should I consult with them in any way?</b><br>This rhetorical question from God highlights the absurdity of seeking divine guidance while harboring idolatry. It underscores the principle that God desires a sincere and undivided heart from those who seek Him. The question implies that genuine communication with God is hindered by sin and idolatry, a theme echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, which speaks of sin creating a separation between God and His people. This also points to the necessity of repentance and the removal of idols to restore a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_israel.htm">The Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders who came to Ezekiel seeking guidance from God, despite harboring idolatry in their hearts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Representations of false gods or anything that takes the place of God in one's heart.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive to Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection for the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The divine response to the idolatry and unfaithfulness of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just about physical idols but anything that takes precedence over God in our hearts.

Like Lot's wife, they longed for that which they dared not do. With such a disposition, they were in the greatest danger, putting "the stumbling-block of their iniquity," the temptation to sin, directly before them. And not only so, but they kept themselves in a state of alienation from God, so that it was idle to imagine He would allow Himself to be enquired of by them.
