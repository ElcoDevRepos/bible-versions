This title emphasizes his humanity and role as a prophet. It is a reminder of his position as a mediator between God and the people of Israel, highlighting his task to convey divine messages.<p><b>take a single stick and write on it:</b><br>The act of taking a stick and writing on it is symbolic. In ancient times, writing on sticks or tablets was a common practice for recording messages. This action signifies a prophetic act, where the stick represents a message or a covenant. The use of a single stick suggests unity or a singular purpose.<p><b>&#8216;Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase refers to the southern kingdom of Judah, which included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, along with the Levites who served in the temple. Historically, after the division of the united monarchy, Judah remained loyal to the Davidic line. The "Israelites associated with him" indicates those who remained faithful to the worship practices centered in Jerusalem.<p><b>Then take another stick and write on it:</b><br>The instruction to take another stick and write on it parallels the first action, emphasizing the dual nature of the message. This second stick represents another group, highlighting the division within the nation of Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Belonging to Joseph&#8212;the stick of Ephraim&#8212;</b><br>Joseph's descendants, primarily through his son Ephraim, became synonymous with the northern kingdom of Israel. Ephraim was the dominant tribe in the north, often representing the entire northern kingdom. This reflects the historical split after Solomon's reign, where the ten northern tribes formed their own kingdom under Jeroboam.<p><b>and to all the house of Israel associated with him.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entirety of the northern tribes, collectively known as Israel. The "house of Israel" refers to the ten tribes that separated from Judah. This division led to distinct political and religious identities, with the northern kingdom often falling into idolatry. The prophecy here foreshadows a future reunification of these divided kingdoms, a theme that resonates with the hope of restoration and unity under a future messianic king, often seen as a type of Christ who unites all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph/ephraim.htm">Joseph/Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often referred to as Ephraim, the dominant tribe.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of God, divided into the northern and southern kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sticks.htm">Sticks</a></b><br>Symbolic objects used by Ezekiel to represent the divided kingdoms of Israel and their future reunification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_god's_plan.htm">Unity in God's Plan</a></b><br>The division of Israel into two kingdoms was a result of disobedience, but God's plan always included their reunification.

The two pieces were, no doubt, so shaped that being firmly held together they would appear as one.<p><span class= "bld">For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.</span>--The object is to represent by the two pieces of wood the two kingdoms. It would be insufficient, therefore, to mention Judah only; for with him Benjamin had been always associated, and also considerable fragments of the other tribes (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-16.htm" title="And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 11:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9</a>). After the fall of the northern kingdom, individual members of the ten tribes who had not been carried into captivity joined themselves more or less completely to the kingdom of Judah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/30-11.htm" title="Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 30:11-18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.">2Chronicles 31:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee one stick, and write</span>. The symbolic action thus prescribed to the prophet was manifestly based on the well-known historical fact that the tribes of Israel, in Mosaic times, had been represented by a rod, on which was inscribed the name of the tribe (<a href="/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2</a>); but whether the stick Ezekiel was instructed to take was a staff, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX., Hirernick, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend), or a block (Ewald), or simply a piece (Keil, Schroder) of wood on which a few words might be traced, cannot be decided. On the first stick the prophet was directed to write, <span class="cmt_word">For Judah, and the house of his companions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the southern kingdom and those of the northern tribes who adhered to it, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Benjamin, Levi, and part of Simeon, with those devout Jehovah-worshippers who from time to time emigrated from other tribes and settled in the land of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12-16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11, 18</a>, 31; 31:1; though by Wellhausen, Smend, and others, such passages are pronounced unhistorical). On the second stick also the prophet was directed to write; but whether <span class="cmt_word">For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and</span> for (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all the house of Israel his companions</span> (Authorized and Revised Versions), or "For Joseph and the whole house of Israel" (Keil), or simply "For Joseph" (Ewald, Havernick, Smend), cannot be determined. Each interpretation can be supported by quite reasonable considerations. For the first may be pleaded that it best accords with the natural sense of the text; for the second, that the phrase, <span class="accented">the stick of Ephraim</span>, appears to be explanatory of and in opposition to "For Joseph;" for the third, that <span class="accented">all the house of Israel</span> stands, like "Ephraim," under the regimen of "stick." The introduction of Joseph as the representative of the northern kingdom rests, not on the fact that Joseph's was the most honorable name among the ten tribes (Havernick), but on the circumstance that the tribe of Joseph, as represented by Ephraim and Manasseh, constituted the main body of the northern kingdom. The addition of Ephraim's name is best accounted for by remembering that in his hand lay the hegemony of the kingdom. "All the house of Israel his companions" signified the rest of the ten tribes. That the two sticks, when joined together in the prophet's hand, were to become one cannot signify that they were then and there to be miraculously united. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;And you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
