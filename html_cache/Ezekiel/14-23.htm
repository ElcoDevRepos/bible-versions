Their conduct and actions will serve as a testimony to God's justice and mercy. In the context of Ezekiel, the prophet is addressing the exiles in Babylon, assuring them that the judgment on Jerusalem is not arbitrary. The remnant's behavior will demonstrate repentance and faithfulness, providing comfort to those who witness it. This reflects the biblical theme of a faithful remnant, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, where God preserves a group who remain true to Him despite widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done all these things within it,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's justice and righteousness in His actions. The destruction of Jerusalem and the exile were not random acts of divine wrath but were responses to the persistent idolatry and sin of the people. This aligns with the Deuteronomic principle of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The phrase underscores the importance of understanding God's actions as purposeful and just, a theme echoed in <a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>, which assures that God does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This closing phrase asserts the authority and sovereignty of God. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) highlights His supreme power and covenantal relationship with Israel. It serves as a reminder that the message comes directly from God, reinforcing the certainty and seriousness of the prophecy. This declaration is a common feature in prophetic literature, emphasizing that the words spoken are not merely human opinions but divine revelations, as seen throughout the books of the prophets, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Israelites who were taken captive to Babylon, experiencing God's judgment and awaiting His promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign deity of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel to convey His divine purposes and judgments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that faced destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness, serving as a focal point of God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conduct_and_actions.htm">The Conduct and Actions</a></b><br>Refers to the behavior of the remnant that will demonstrate God's justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_justice.htm">Understanding Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's actions are always just and purposeful, even when they involve judgment.
