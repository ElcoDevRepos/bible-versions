Sidon, one of the oldest Phoenician cities, was renowned for its skilled sailors and shipbuilders. Arvad, an island city, was similarly noted for its naval capabilities. The mention of these cities highlights Tyre's reliance on neighboring regions for manpower, emphasizing the interconnectedness of ancient maritime trade networks. This reflects the historical context where city-states often collaborated for economic and military purposes. The use of Sidon and Arvad's men as oarsmen underscores Tyre's extensive trade and influence across the Mediterranean, as well as its dependence on the expertise of others to maintain its commercial dominance.<p><b>Your men of skill, O Tyre, were there as your captains.</b><br>Tyre was a leading city of Phoenicia, famed for its wealth and advanced maritime technology. The reference to "men of skill" indicates the high level of expertise and leadership within Tyre itself. These captains were likely responsible for navigating the complex trade routes and ensuring the safety and success of Tyre's commercial ventures. This phrase highlights the city's internal resources and capabilities, contrasting with its reliance on external manpower for more labor-intensive tasks. The skilled leadership of Tyre's own people would have been crucial in maintaining its status as a powerful and prosperous trading hub.
