In the Old Testament, idolatry is often depicted as spiritual adultery. The Israelites were called to be a holy nation, set apart for God, but they frequently turned to the practices and gods of surrounding nations. The term "lustful neighbors" refers to the nations around Israel that were known for their idolatrous practices and moral corruption. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as Hosea, where Israel's unfaithfulness is likened to a wife's infidelity.<p><b>the Egyptians</b><br>Egypt is frequently mentioned in the Bible as a symbol of worldly power and idolatry. Historically, Egypt was a dominant force in the region and often a temptation for Israel to seek political alliances and military support, rather than relying on God. The Israelites' past enslavement in Egypt also serves as a backdrop for their recurring temptation to return to Egyptian ways, both physically and spiritually. This reference highlights Israel's tendency to look back to Egypt for security, despite God's deliverance from there.<p><b>and increased your promiscuity</b><br>The increase in promiscuity signifies a deepening of Israel's idolatrous practices. This is not just a return to previous sins but an escalation, indicating a growing distance from God. The prophets often warned Israel about the consequences of such actions, emphasizing that their spiritual infidelity would lead to judgment. This phrase underscores the seriousness of Israel's rebellion and the extent to which they have abandoned their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>to provoke Me to anger</b><br>God's anger is a response to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. In the biblical context, God's anger is not arbitrary but a just reaction to sin and idolatry. The covenant established at Sinai included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Israel's actions provoked God because they violated the terms of this covenant, showing disregard for His holiness and love. This phrase serves as a warning of impending judgment, a theme prevalent in the prophetic books, where God's patience is contrasted with His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The verse calls every believer to recognize the gravity of turning anywhere but to the Lord for security and fulfillment, and to cling afresh to the faithful Husband of our souls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">The Egyptians . . . great of flesh.</span>--The Egyptians are properly named first, because, even in the golden calf of the wilderness, the Israelites turned with avidity to the worship of Egypt. This tendency seems to have been only suppressed, not extinguished, during the subsequent ages, and remained ever ready to develop itself, as in the calves of Jeroboam (<a href="/context/1_kings/12-28.htm" title="Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">1Kings 12:28-30</a>); but it received great accession of strength during the reigns of Solomon and his successors. The Egyptians are called "great of flesh" from the character of their popular worship, which was a thoroughly sensuous nature worship. The connection of Israel with Egypt in the latter part of the monarchy was not only religious, but political, in bold defiance of the reiterated Divine commands. Especially at this time, a great part of the work of Jeremiah was to oppose the tendency of the successive kings of Judah to alliance with Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the Egyptians.</span> The words point to political and commercial alliances, in themselves a whoredom (<a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>), such as Zedekiah, like some of his predecessors, had trusted in, as well as to the adoption of Egyptian worship, such as we have seen in <a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>, the one leading naturally to the other.
