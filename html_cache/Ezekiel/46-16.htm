In the prophetic books, this introduction is common, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, similar to how "Thus saith the Lord" is used in other parts of the Old Testament.<p><b>If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons as an inheritance:</b><br>The "prince" here refers to a leader or ruler in the restored Israel, possibly a Davidic figure, as Ezekiel often speaks of a future ideal leader. The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in Israelite culture, where land and property were passed down through generations, as seen in the laws of inheritance in <a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8-11</a>. This reflects the importance of family lineage and the continuity of God's promises to His people.<p><b>it will belong to his descendants:</b><br>This phrase highlights the permanence of the inheritance, ensuring that the gift remains within the family line. It echoes the covenantal promises made to Abraham and his descendants in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>, where God promises the land to Abraham's offspring. This continuity is crucial for maintaining tribal and familial identity in Israel.<p><b>It will become their property by inheritance:</b><br>The emphasis on property rights and inheritance laws is significant in the context of ancient Israel, where land was a primary source of wealth and sustenance. This reflects the legal and social structures in place to protect family holdings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>, which discusses the Year of Jubilee and the redemption of property. Theologically, it points to the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where an imperishable inheritance is promised to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign ruler and ultimate authority, speaking through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler in Israel, possibly representing the Davidic line or a future messianic figure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons.htm">Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of the prince, who are the recipients of the inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The property or gift given by the prince to his sons, signifying a transfer of ownership and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God communicates His laws and visions to the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_inheritance.htm">The Importance of Inheritance</a></b><br>Inheritance is not just a transfer of property but a continuation of legacy and blessing.

Similar prophetic formulae in <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4&#8211;5</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a> remind us that the prophet speaks only what God authorizes. Because the entire vision (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40&#8211;48</a>) comes from the same divine source, the details that follow carry the weight of God&#8217;s unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Identifying the prince</b><p>The &#8220;prince&#8221; appears repeatedly in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/44.htm">Ezekiel 44&#8211;46</a>. He is distinguished from the priests (<a href="/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>) yet closely associated with the Davidic line promised an everlasting throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23&#8211;24</a>). While never called &#8220;king,&#8221; he functions as the civil ruler in the millennial temple economy, anticipating the ultimate reign of Christ (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>) while still representing the restored house of David on earth (<a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Understanding the gift</b><p>&#8220;If the prince gives a gift&#8221; implies voluntary generosity rather than payment or tax. Under Mosaic Law, rulers held territorial allotments (<a href="/1_samuel/8-14.htm">1 Samuel 8:14</a>), but Ezekiel clarifies righteous boundaries so the prince cannot oppress the people (<a href="/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>). The gift, therefore, illustrates servant-leadership that reflects God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Focus on sons and descendants</b><p>The phrase &#8220;to any of his sons as an inheritance&#8221; guarantees that legitimate heirs receive what the prince assigns. This echoes God&#8217;s earlier defense of familial inheritance rights (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15&#8211;17</a>). By specifying &#8220;it will belong to his descendants,&#8221; the passage safeguards against confiscation or redistribution that would violate covenant order (<a href="/1_kings/21-3.htm">1 Kings 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The permanence of inheritance</b><p>&#8220;It will become their property by inheritance&#8221; stresses lasting possession, paralleling God&#8217;s promise of Israel&#8217;s land &#8220;for an everlasting possession&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). In the millennial setting, stability of land ownership reflects the faithfulness of God&#8217;s covenant with David and Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>). The prince may steward land, but once transferred to his sons it is theirs in perpetuity, underscoring the security found in God&#8217;s decrees (<a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Implications for covenant faithfulness</b><p>By legislating the prince&#8217;s generosity and limiting his power, God protects both royal heirs and common Israelites. This prevents abuses that plagued earlier monarchies (<a href="/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1&#8211;2</a>). The structure mirrors the perfect justice of Christ&#8217;s future rule, where righteousness and peace flourish (<a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical takeaways for believers today</b><p>&#8226; God values orderly transfer of blessings; inheritance laws reveal His concern for family continuity (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaders are called to give without exploitation, reflecting Christlike stewardship (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The permanence promised here foreshadows our &#8220;imperishable, undefiled&#8221; inheritance kept in heaven (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a> establishes a just principle: when the future prince grants land to his sons, that land is theirs forever. Rooted in God&#8217;s authority, the command protects family inheritance, restrains governmental overreach, and anticipates the unshakeable security of God&#8217;s kingdom. The verse points us to a righteous rule where gifts are given freely, possessions are held securely, and God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness stands at the center of communal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">If the prince give a gift.--</span><a href="/context/ezekiel/46-15.htm" title="Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.">Ezekiel 46:15-18</a> contain provisions in regard to the prince's alienation of his domain. According to <a href="/context/ezekiel/45-7.htm" title="And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.">Ezekiel 45:7-8</a>, he was to have a portion of land on each side of the "oblation," which should be sufficiently ample to prevent any attempts on his part at violence and exaction. For the same purpose, it was necessary that this territory should remain inalienably in his family. He might therefore convey any portion of it to his sons in fee simple, for they would naturally inherit it; but a conveyance to any one else came under the Mosaic law (Leviticus 25), and reverted to him or his heirs in the year of Jubile, here called "the year of liberty."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - Instructions for the prince as to how he should deal with his property are summarized in three regulations, introduced by the solemn formula of "Thus saith the Lord" (comp. ver. 1; <a href="/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">The first regulation</span>.
