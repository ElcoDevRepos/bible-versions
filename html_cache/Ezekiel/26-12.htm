Historically, Tyre was a wealthy and powerful city-state known for its trade and commerce, particularly in purple dye and luxury goods. The prophecy foretells the stripping away of its economic prosperity. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of divine judgment against pride and reliance on material wealth, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a> and <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which also describe the fall of prosperous cities.<p><b>They will demolish your walls,</b><br>The walls of Tyre were renowned for their strength and fortification, symbolizing security and defense. The prophecy of their demolition signifies the complete vulnerability and defeat of the city. This act of destruction is a common motif in biblical prophecies against cities that have turned away from God, emphasizing that no human-made defenses can withstand divine judgment. The fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a> serves as a parallel example of God&#8217;s power over fortified cities.<p><b>tear down your beautiful homes,</b><br>The mention of "beautiful homes" highlights the opulence and architectural splendor of Tyre. The destruction of these homes signifies not only the loss of physical structures but also the end of a lifestyle characterized by luxury and excess. This reflects the biblical principle that earthly beauty and wealth are temporary and can be swiftly taken away, as echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a> and <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10-11</a>.<p><b>and throw your stones and timber and soil into the water.</b><br>This phrase vividly describes the complete dismantling of the city, with its very materials being cast into the sea. Historically, this was fulfilled when Alexander the Great used the debris of the mainland city to build a causeway to the island city of Tyre during his siege in 332 BC. This act symbolizes the total obliteration and transformation of the city&#8217;s landscape. The imagery of stones and timber being thrown into the water also evokes the idea of irreversible judgment, akin to the casting of Babylon&#8217;s millstone into the sea in <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>, signifying the finality of God&#8217;s judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

It is no longer Nebuchadnezzar who does these things, but "they." This may intimate that the prophet's vision now again passes beyond the immediate future to the long succession of calamities, beginning indeed with Nebuchadnezzar's conquest, with which Tyre was to be visited. The "spoil" and "prey" is to be understood more of what the Tyrians lost than of what the conquerors gained. In the long-continued sieges to which the city was subjected there was great waste of its substance; but their command of the water generally enabled them before the close to send away their moveable wealth, so that the booty of the victor was small. (With the close of the verse comp. <a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm" title="And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.">Ezekiel 26:4</a>.)
