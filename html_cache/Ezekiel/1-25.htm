This voice is indicative of God's direct interaction with His prophets, as seen in other instances such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The voice here underscores the authority and majesty of God, who speaks to Ezekiel, affirming the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>from above the expanse</b><br>The expanse, or firmament, is reminiscent of the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>, where God creates the sky to separate the waters. In Ezekiel's vision, the expanse represents the separation between the divine and earthly realms, highlighting the transcendence of God. This imagery reinforces the idea of God's throne being above all creation, emphasizing His sovereignty and omnipotence.<p><b>over their heads</b><br>The phrase refers to the living creatures described earlier in the chapter, which are cherubim, a type of angelic being. In ancient Near Eastern culture, cherubim were often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, such as the entrance to the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). Their position under the expanse signifies their role as servants and messengers of God, supporting His divine presence.<p><b>as they stood still</b><br>The stillness of the cherubim indicates a moment of reverence and attention, preparing for the divine message. This pause can be seen as a symbol of submission and readiness to receive God's commands. In biblical narratives, moments of stillness often precede significant revelations or actions, such as the calming of the storm by Jesus (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>with their wings lowered</b><br>Lowered wings suggest humility and respect in the presence of God. In the context of ancient worship practices, lowering one's posture was a sign of reverence and submission. The cherubim's actions here reflect the appropriate response to divine authority, paralleling the humility shown by figures like Isaiah in his vision of God's throne room (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>). This imagery also points to the ultimate submission of Christ, who humbled Himself in obedience to the Father (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings described in Ezekiel's vision, characterized by their multiple faces and wings, symbolizing God's majesty and presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_expanse.htm">The Expanse</a></b><br>A firmament or platform above the cherubim, representing the separation between the divine and the earthly realms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_from_above.htm">Voice from Above</a></b><br>Represents the voice of God, indicating divine communication and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites were in captivity, longing for God's guidance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_presence.htm">The Majesty of God's Presence</a></b><br>The vision in <a href="/ezekiel/1-25.htm">Ezekiel 1:25</a> reminds us of the awe-inspiring nature of God's presence.

This is a new feature in the vision: the voice is quite different from the sounds mentioned before, and although not here expressly said to have been articulate, yet it is probably to be identified with the Divine voice spoken of in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm" title="As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.

In its connection, however, it seems rather to convey the idea of a fresh act of reverence towards the majesty above. When the voice was heard the cherubim stood still, the mighty sounds of their going were hushed, and their wings fell motionless, all in the attitude of reverential attention.<p>The vision now advances to another and final stage. We have had the whirlwind from the north, with its great cloud and infolding fire, as the background on which the whole is portrayed; then the cherubim, with all their marvellous symbolism; the wondrous and terrible wheels, connecting them with the earth below, the glowing firmament, connecting them with the throne above; and now we come to the throne itself, and to Him that sat upon it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a voice from the firmament</span>.
