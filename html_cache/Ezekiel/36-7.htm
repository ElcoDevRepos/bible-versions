In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to His people through the prophet, underscoring the seriousness of His message. This is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but divine revelation.<p><b>I have sworn with an uplifted hand:</b><br>Swearing with an uplifted hand is a gesture of making a solemn oath, signifying the certainty and unchangeable nature of God's promise. This imagery is rooted in ancient Near Eastern practices where oaths were often accompanied by physical gestures to demonstrate commitment. It reflects God's unwavering intention to fulfill His word, similar to His covenantal promises found in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a> and <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>.<p><b>that surely the nations around you:</b><br>The "nations around you" refers to the surrounding peoples and countries that have historically been adversaries of Israel, such as Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia. These nations often opposed Israel and rejoiced in its misfortunes. The historical context includes the geopolitical tensions and hostilities that Israel faced, which are documented in various Old Testament narratives.<p><b>will endure reproach of their own:</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes where the nations that once mocked and oppressed Israel will themselves experience shame and disgrace. It is a prophetic assurance of divine justice, where God promises to vindicate His people. This theme of retribution is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11-12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>, where God promises to judge the nations for their actions against Israel.

Because of that abuse, the sovereign LORD now speaks--and when He speaks, His word is final (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8-9</a>). The same prophetic formula appears repeatedly in Ezekiel (e.g., 6:3; 34:10) to underscore two truths:<p>&#8226; God alone has the right to interpret events and announce their outcome.<p>&#8226; Whatever He decrees will come to pass, just as earlier judgments on Judah literally arrived (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have sworn with an uplifted hand</b><p>&#8220;I have sworn with an uplifted hand&#8221; pictures the LORD raising His own hand in court-like oath (<a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>). Because &#8220;it is impossible for God to lie&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>), this gesture signals an unbreakable promise. In Scripture, when God swears an oath:<p>&#8226; He binds Himself to act (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; He offers comfort to His people that His plan cannot be overturned (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p>Here, the hand lifted toward heaven guarantees that what follows is not wishful thinking but settled reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that surely</b><p>The adverb &#8220;surely&#8221; stresses certainty. It echoes the double &#8220;truly, truly&#8221; of Jesus in the Gospels (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>) and the &#8220;Amen&#8221; that closes many biblical prayers (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20-21</a>).

Their shame, plunder, and defeat will match the evil they did to Israel (<a href="/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-8</a>).
