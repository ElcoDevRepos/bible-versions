In biblical symbolism, the human face often represents wisdom and understanding, reflecting humanity's unique role in creation as beings made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>). The human face on these creatures may also signify the relational aspect of God's nature, as humans are capable of personal relationships, mirroring God's desire for a relationship with His creation.<p><b>and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side</b><br>The lion is a symbol of strength, majesty, and kingship. In the ancient Near East, lions were often associated with royalty and divine power. The lion's face on the right side of the creatures may indicate the authority and sovereignty of God. This imagery is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, where Jesus is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah," highlighting His kingly authority and power.<p><b>the face of an ox on the left side</b><br>The ox represents service, strength, and sacrifice. In ancient cultures, oxen were vital for agriculture and were often used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing servitude and endurance. The presence of the ox's face may point to the aspect of God's nature that involves provision and sacrifice. This imagery can be connected to Christ's role as the suffering servant, who came to serve and give His life as a ransom for many (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>and also the face of an eagle</b><br>The eagle is a symbol of swiftness, vision, and transcendence. In biblical literature, eagles are often associated with divine protection and deliverance, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, where God describes carrying the Israelites on "eagles' wings." The eagle's face may represent God's omniscience and His ability to see all things from a heavenly perspective. It also reflects the aspect of God that is above and beyond the earthly realm, pointing to His eternal nature and the promise of renewal and strength for those who trust in Him (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of the four living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_living_creatures.htm">Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are angelic beings described in Ezekiel's vision, each having four faces and four wings, symbolizing different aspects of God's creation and character.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, where the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, leading to a period of reflection and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_faces.htm">Symbolism of the Faces</a></b><br>The face of a man represents intelligence and reason, reminding us of our unique role in creation as bearers of God's image.<br><br>The lion symbolizes strength and majesty, encouraging believers to live boldly in faith.<br><br>The ox signifies service and sacrifice, calling us to a life of dedication and hard work for God's kingdom.<br><br>The eagle represents swiftness and vision, urging us to rise above earthly concerns and focus on heavenly matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_majesty.htm">God's Sovereignty and Majesty</a></b><br>The diverse faces of the creatures reflect the multifaceted nature of God's rule over creation, reminding us of His ultimate authority and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The harmonious presence of different faces on each creature illustrates the unity and diversity within God's creation, encouraging us to appreciate and embrace diversity within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_perspective.htm">Heavenly Perspective</a></b><br>The vision challenges us to adopt a heavenly perspective, seeing beyond the immediate and temporal to the eternal and divine purposes of God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_1_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_1_10_faces_God_s_nature.htm">How do the four faces in Ezekiel 1:10 symbolize God's multifaceted nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_do_Ezekiel_1_10_faces_reveal_of_God.htm">What can we learn about God's character from the creatures' faces in Ezekiel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_1_10_faces_vs_Revelation_beings.htm">How do the faces in Ezekiel 1:10 connect to Revelation's depiction of heavenly beings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_1_10_s_impact_on_worship.htm">How can understanding Ezekiel 1:10 deepen our worship and reverence for God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Ezekiel_1_10_imagery_inspire_us.htm">How might the imagery in Ezekiel 1:10 inspire us in our daily walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_do_the_four_faces_in_Ezekiel_mean_2.htm">What is the significance of the four faces in Ezekiel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Ezekiel_s_faces_reflect_God.htm">How do the four faces in Ezekiel 1:10 relate to God's nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_choose_man_lion_ox_eagle_in_Ezekiel.htm">Why are the faces of a man, lion, ox, and eagle chosen in Ezekiel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/inconsistencies_in_ezekiel_1_vs._isaiah_6.htm">Are there any inconsistencies between Ezekiel&#8217;s vision (Ezekiel 1) and visions of divine glory in other scriptural passages, such as Isaiah 6 or Revelation 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_cherubim_have_four_faces.htm">In Ezekiel 10:14, why do the cherubim have four faces, seemingly inconsistent with other biblical angelic descriptions?

Each facet shines simultaneously, emphasizing that the Lord&#8217;s glory encompasses every virtue without contradiction. As these heavenly servants mirror their Maker, so believers are called to reflect His character in thought, courage, service, and worship, trusting that the God who revealed Himself to Ezekiel remains the same yesterday, today, and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">On the right side . . . on the left side.</span>--The apparent obscurity of this description is due only to the punctuation in the English Bible. "They four had the face of a man" (viz., in front, as Ezekiel viewed them), "and the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle" (viz., on the back, or side opposite to Ezekiel). These faces are the same as those given to the living creatures in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7</a>, except that there each creature had but one of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for the likeness,</span> etc. The Revised Version rightly strikes out the comma after "lion." The human face meets the prophet's gaze. On the right he sees the lion, on the left the ox, while the face of the eagle is behind. What did the symbols mean? <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The human face represents the thought that man, as made "after the image of God" (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), is the highest symbol of the Eternal. So long as we remember that it is but a symbol, anthropomorphism is legitimate in thought, and appropriate in visions; though, like theriomorphism, it becomes perilous, and is therefore forbidden (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>) when it takes concrete form in metal or in stone. So Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9, 13</a>) sees the "Ancient of Days" and "one like unto a son of man;" and St. John's vision (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>) represents the same symbolism. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The lion had been the familiar emblem of sovereignty, both in the temple of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>) and in his palace (<a href="/1_kings/10-20.htm">1 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-18.htm">2 Chronicles 9:18, 19</a>). So, in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>, it is the symbol of the kingly power of Judah, and appears with a yet higher application in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>; while, on the other hand, it represents one of the great monarchies of the world in <a href="/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>. Its modern heraldic use in the arms of England and elsewhere presents yet another analogue. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The ox had appeared, as here, so also in <a href="/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25, 44</a>, in company with the lion, notably in the twelve oxen that supported the "sea" or "laver" in the temple. Here also we have a kind of sovereignty - the natural symbol of a strength made subservient to human uses. Both the lion and the ox, as we have seen, may have become familiar to Ezekiel as a priest ministering in the temple or as an exile.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The form</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
