In the context of ancient Israel, foreigners or "sojourners" were often seen as outsiders. However, this directive indicates a shift towards inclusivity, reflecting God's heart for all nations. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God's plan includes blessing all nations through Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The presence of foreigners in Israelite tribes also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>you are to assign his inheritance there</b><br>The concept of inheritance in Israel was deeply tied to land, which was considered a divine gift and a sign of God's promise. Assigning inheritance to foreigners signifies their full integration into the community, granting them rights and responsibilities similar to native-born Israelites. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament idea of Gentiles being grafted into the spiritual inheritance of Israel (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>). It also reflects the Jubilee principle, where land and property were to be restored, emphasizing God's provision and justice.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and sovereignty of God in making this declaration. It is a reminder that the inclusion of foreigners and the assignment of inheritance is not merely a social or political decision but a divine mandate. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) emphasizes both the covenantal and powerful aspects of God's character. This declaration aligns with God's consistent message throughout Scripture that He is a God of justice, mercy, and inclusion, who desires all people to come to Him (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his visions and prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel and the coming of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, a foreigner (Hebrew: "ger") was someone who lived among the Israelites but was not originally part of the Israelite tribes.
