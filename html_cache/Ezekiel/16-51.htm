Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, is used as a point of comparison. Historically, Samaria was known for its idolatry and rebellion against God, which led to its downfall and conquest by the Assyrians in 722 BC. The phrase highlights the severity of Jerusalem's sins, suggesting that they have surpassed even those of Samaria. This comparison underscores the gravity of Jerusalem's unfaithfulness, as Samaria was already infamous for its transgressions. Theologically, this serves as a warning about the consequences of spiritual adultery and idolatry.<p><b>You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs,</b><br>Jerusalem's sins are described as "abominations," a term often used in the Old Testament to denote actions that are detestable to God, particularly idolatry and moral corruption. The multiplication of these abominations indicates a progressive and deliberate increase in sinful behavior. This reflects a deep-seated rebellion against God's covenant, as Jerusalem not only engaged in idolatry but also adopted the detestable practices of surrounding nations. The historical context includes the influence of Canaanite and other pagan religions, which led to practices such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. This phrase emphasizes the extent of Jerusalem's spiritual decline.<p><b>and all the abominations you have committed have made your sisters appear righteous.</b><br>The "sisters" refer to Samaria and Sodom, as mentioned earlier in the chapter. In biblical typology, Sodom is often associated with extreme wickedness and divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. By stating that Jerusalem's actions have made these cities appear righteous, God is highlighting the shocking nature of Jerusalem's sins. This hyperbolic comparison serves to shame Jerusalem, as even the notoriously sinful cities seem virtuous in contrast. Theologically, this illustrates the concept of relative righteousness and the danger of complacency in one's spiritual state. It also foreshadows the impending judgment that Jerusalem will face due to its unrepentant heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

Now He adds another layer of indictment, much like Jesus escalating His warnings to unrepentant towns in <a href="/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-24</a>. This single word signals that the coming charge is not isolated but the culmination of a long, patient, and righteous case God has been building.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samaria did not commit half the sins you did</b><p>In plain terms, Judah&#8217;s southern capital, Jerusalem, has out-sinned the northern kingdom&#8217;s capital, Samaria. Samaria&#8217;s history&#8212;marked by golden calves, Baal worship, and Assyrian exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>)&#8212;was notorious. Yet God declares that Judah&#8217;s rebellion is at least double.<p>Key implications:<p>&#8226; God measures nations by the light they possess (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>). Judah had the temple, priests, sacrifices, and prophetic voices galore. Greater privilege brings greater accountability.<p>&#8226; The comparison humbles religious pride. Judah presumed superiority over Samaria; God reverses the judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46-47</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that external heritage&#8212;being descendants of David, having the right liturgy&#8212;cannot mask willful disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs</b><p>&#8220;Abominations&#8221; points to detestable idolatries and moral corruption (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6, 16</a>-17). Judah didn&#8217;t merely imitate Samaria; she innovated new layers of sin.<p>Consider how the multiplication looked:<p>&#8226; Idolatry inside the temple itself (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Child sacrifice in the Valley of Hinnom (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Political alliances that traded trust in the Lord for trust in pagan nations (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>).<p>God&#8217;s math is sobering: privilege + persistence in sin = multiplied guilt. It echoes Jesus&#8217; lament, &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem&#8230; how often I would have gathered your children&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the abominations you have committed have made your sisters appear righteous</b><p>&#8220;Sisters&#8221; refers to Samaria (north) and Sodom (south), already labeled wicked in verses 48-50. Judah&#8217;s conduct was so foul it made even those infamous cities look good by comparison. This is a rhetorical shock, similar to Jesus telling Capernaum that Sodom would fare better on judgment day (<a href="/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23-24</a>).<p>Why does their sin elevate the perceived righteousness of others?<p>&#8226; Sin distorts moral perspective; when the covenant people plunge deeper than pagans, the contrast magnifies (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God upholds absolute standards; relative righteousness doesn&#8217;t save Samaria or Sodom, but it exposes Judah&#8217;s greater guilt (<a href="/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the warning is clear: when God&#8217;s people compromise, the watching world feels justified in its unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-51.htm">Ezekiel 16:51</a> piles evidence upon evidence: the covenant city with the greatest light committed the darkest sins, outstripping notorious Samaria and making even Sodom look respectable. God&#8217;s verdict highlights the seriousness of squandered privilege, the escalating nature of sin, and the sobering reality that His people can bring greater reproach on His name than outright pagans. The verse calls us to wholehearted repentance, reverent obedience, and a renewed gratitude for the grace that, in Christ, offers cleansing and restoration to any who will turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">Hast justified thy sisters.</span>--The same expression is repeated in the following verse. In both it is evidently used in a comparative sense.

Sodom and Samaria might claim a verdict of acquittal ("justify," in its technical sense) as compared with Judah. They had not presented, as she had done, a confluence of all the worst idolatries. The words find something like an echo in our Lord's teaching <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>. And, as is common m such cases," she had judged," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> had passed sentence of condemnation on those who were more righteous than herself. The Revised Version changes both meaning and punctuation: <span class="accented">Bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters</span>; <span class="accented">through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou</span>; but the Authorized Version seems preferable. It may be questioned whether the word for <span class="cmt_word">judged</span> is ever used of an acquittal. The point of the sentence is that Judah condemned those who were less guilty than herself (comp. <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Samaria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1443;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
