In biblical context, sight often represents the initial point of temptation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a> with Eve and the forbidden fruit. The Israelites were warned against being led astray by what they saw, as in <a href="/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>. This highlights the importance of guarding one's eyes and heart against idolatry and sin.<p><b>she lusted for them</b><br>Lust here symbolizes a deep, consuming desire that leads to spiritual adultery. In the prophetic literature, Israel's idolatry is often depicted as unfaithfulness to God, akin to marital infidelity. This mirrors the language used in Hosea, where Israel's pursuit of other gods is likened to an adulterous wife. The lust for foreign nations and their gods represents a turning away from the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<p><b>and sent messengers to them</b><br>Sending messengers signifies an active pursuit and deliberate choice to engage with foreign powers, contrary to God's commands. This action reflects Israel's political alliances with pagan nations, seeking security and prosperity outside of God's provision. Historically, Israel and Judah often sought alliances with powerful neighbors like Egypt and Assyria, which led to their downfall.<p><b>in Chaldea</b><br>Chaldea refers to the region of southern Babylonia, known for its wealth and power during the time of Ezekiel. The Chaldeans, or Babylonians, were rising to prominence and would eventually conquer Judah, leading to the Babylonian exile. This geographical reference underscores the historical context of Israel's entanglement with Babylonian culture and politics, which was both a literal and spiritual captivity. The mention of Chaldea also foreshadows the coming judgment and exile as a consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah</a></b><br>This is a symbolic name for Jerusalem, representing the southern kingdom of Judah. In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, Oholibah is depicted as an unfaithful woman who lusts after foreign nations and their idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldea.htm">Chaldea</a></b><br>This refers to the region of Babylonia, known for its powerful empire and influence. The Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and cultural achievements, but also for their idolatry and pagan practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>These are representatives sent by Oholibah (Judah) to Chaldea, symbolizing Judah's desire to form alliances and adopt the ways of the Babylonians, rather than relying on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Just as Oholibah lusted after the Chaldeans, believers today must guard against the allure of modern-day idols, whether they be material possessions, power, or cultural trends.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_alone.htm">Trust in God Alone</a></b><br>Judah's reliance on foreign alliances rather than God serves as a warning to place our trust solely in the Lord, not in worldly powers or solutions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">The Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>The account of Oholibah illustrates the spiritual and physical consequences of turning away from God.

In Scripture, physical lust often mirrors spiritual unfaithfulness.<p>- Ezekiel earlier called this &#8220;playing the harlot&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>); here the language is stronger, showing persistence in sin despite prior discipline (<a href="/ezekiel/23-11.htm">Ezekiel 23:11</a>).<p>- <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a> sets the same pattern: forgetting the Lord leads to running after lovers with &#8220;rings and jewelry.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a> reminds believers that friendship with the world is enmity with God. Jerusalem&#8217;s craving for Babylon&#8217;s power and religion proves the point.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sent messengers to them</b><p>Sin moves from desire to deliberate action. Diplomatic envoys carry gifts and flattery to Babylon, hoping to secure military help and cultural prestige.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1-6</a> records Hezekiah entertaining Babylonian envoys&#8212;an earlier step in the same direction.<p>- <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-2</a> shows how reliance on Babylon eventually backfired, leading to invasion.<p>- Reaching out to a pagan power for security contradicted God&#8217;s call to trust Him alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Chaldea</b><p>&#8220;Chaldea&#8221; pinpoints the heartland of Babylon. The setting matters:<p>- It is the very region God would soon use to judge Judah (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p>- By seeking favor there, Jerusalem effectively ran toward the instrument of its own discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-10</a>).<p>- The phrase highlights how determined the people were, willing to cross both geography and conscience to secure what they wanted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a> exposes a tragic progression: seeing, desiring, acting, and aligning with the world&#8217;s system. Jerusalem willingly pursued Babylon, rejecting covenant faithfulness and inviting judgment. The verse warns every generation that unchecked fascination with worldly power and beauty can lead believers into spiritual adultery, but it also calls us back to wholehearted devotion to the Lord, whose Word remains true and sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Saw them with her eyes.</span>--This is to be taken in a sense wide enough to include knowledge obtained in any way, as well as by actual sight.
