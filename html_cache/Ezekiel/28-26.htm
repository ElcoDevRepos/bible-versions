Historically, Israel faced numerous threats from surrounding nations, including the Philistines, Moabites, and Edomites. The promise of dwelling securely indicates a future time of divine protection and stability. This security is often associated with the Messianic age, a time when God&#8217;s people will experience peace under the reign of the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>.<p><b>build houses, and plant vineyards</b><br>Building houses and planting vineyards symbolize permanence and prosperity. In ancient Israel, these activities were signs of settled life and blessing, contrasting with the nomadic or exilic experiences of the Israelites. The imagery recalls the blessings of the Promised Land described in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>, where God promised a land of abundance. It also reflects the restoration themes found in <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>, where God promises to restore the fortunes of His people.<p><b>They will dwell securely when I execute judgments against all those around them who treat them with contempt</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine justice that God will enact against Israel's enemies. The surrounding nations often oppressed and scorned Israel, as seen in the historical accounts of Assyria and Babylon. God's judgments are a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where He promises to vindicate His people and punish their oppressors, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>. This divine intervention ensures the security and peace of Israel.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The recognition of God as LORD is a central theme in Ezekiel. This acknowledgment comes through His acts of judgment and restoration. The phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God&#8217;s actions reveal His sovereignty and faithfulness. This recognition is not just intellectual but relational, leading to a deeper understanding and worship of God, as seen in similar declarations in <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23 and 39</a>:28. The ultimate fulfillment of this knowledge is found in the New Covenant, where God&#8217;s people will know Him intimately through Jesus Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are promised security and prosperity in their land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>The surrounding nations that have treated Israel with contempt and hostility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises protection and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgments.htm">Judgments</a></b><br>Divine actions against Israel's enemies, ensuring their security.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_israel.htm">Land of Israel</a></b><br>The promised land where the Israelites will dwell securely.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_god's_promises.htm">Security in God's Promises</a></b><br>God's promises of security and prosperity are contingent upon His divine judgment and protection.

This echoes earlier assurances such as &#8220;I will establish a covenant of peace&#8230;and they will live securely&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>) and &#8220;I will gather them&#8230;and none shall make them afraid&#8221; (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). The word &#8220;there&#8221; points to their own land, the same territory sworn to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). Security here is not merely emotional comfort; it is tangible protection, the peace that follows divine restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>build houses</b><p>House-building signals permanence. After years of exile, God pictures His people laying foundations, hammering beams, settling down for generations (<a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>). It recalls the directive to &#8220;build houses and live in them&#8221; in Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5</a>), but this time it is in the promised land, under God&#8217;s direct blessing. Construction activity also reflects economic stability and family life restored (<a href="/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and plant vineyards</b><p>Planting vineyards takes patience; vines mature over seasons. The image underscores confidence in a peaceful future long enough to see fruit (<a href="/leviticus/25-18.htm">Leviticus 25:18-19</a>). It mirrors the prophetic vision of sitting &#8220;under his vine and fig tree&#8221; without fear (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). Agriculture thriving in Israel&#8217;s soil embodies the covenant blessings of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will dwell securely when I execute judgments against all those around them who treat them with contempt</b><p>God ties Israel&#8217;s safety to His active judgment on hostile nations. Earlier chapters foretold judgments on Tyre, Sidon, Egypt, and others (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25&#8211;32</a>). Divine justice disarms the enemies, creating the conditions for peace, just as He defeated Pharaoh before leading Israel through the sea (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a> affirms that those who &#8220;touch the apple of His eye&#8221; face God&#8217;s hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD their God</b><p>The ultimate goal is revelation, not merely relief. When protection and prosperity arrive exactly as promised, Israel will recognize Yahweh&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a>). Similar refrains appear throughout Ezekiel (6:7; 37:6), underscoring that fulfilled prophecy authenticates the Lord&#8217;s identity. Gentile observers will also see and learn (<a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a> paints a future where Israel inhabits its land in unthreatened peace, engages in normal, fruitful labor, and lives under God&#8217;s unmistakable care. Housing and vineyards picture permanence; divine judgment on enemies secures borders; and the resulting tranquility leads all to acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness and authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall build houses</span>, etc. The words sound almost like a direct quotation from <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> and Jeremiah 36:28; and, at all events, present a suggestive parallel. The restoration was to include also the blessing of confidence and hope; no longer a groundless and false confidence, like that of <a href="/jeremiah/2-37.htm">Jeremiah 2:37</a> and Jeremiah 48:13, but one resting on the fact that God was in very deed the Judge of all the earth. We may note, at the close of the chapter, how its juxtaposition of the two Phoenician cities seems to have been present to the mind of the Christ in his references to the judgment that should come upon both of them (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="/luke/10-13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>). He himself, it will be remembered, passed through the coasts of Tyre and Zidon (<a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>), and probably, according to the best text of <a href="/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24</a>, actually trod the streets of the latter city.
