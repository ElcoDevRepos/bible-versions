The "ruler of the nations" is typically understood as Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who was used by God as an instrument of judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign powers to execute His will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>, where Assyria is described as the rod of God's anger. The sovereignty of God over all nations is emphasized, showing that He can raise up and bring down kingdoms according to His purposes.<p><b>for him to deal with it according to its wickedness</b><br>The phrase highlights the principle of divine retribution, where nations are judged according to their actions. The wickedness of the nation, likely referring to its pride and idolatry, warranted divine judgment. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that God judges nations for their moral and spiritual failures, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the fall of Babylon (Revelation 18). The concept of reaping what one sows is a recurring biblical theme (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>I have banished it</b><br>The finality of God's judgment is underscored here. The term "banished" indicates a complete removal or destruction, akin to the fate of the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>) and the exile of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>). This reflects the seriousness of divine judgment and the consequences of turning away from God. The imagery of a tree being cut down and removed is also a type of Christ, who spoke of Himself as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), contrasting the faithfulness of Christ with the unfaithfulness of the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
