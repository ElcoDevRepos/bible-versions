Historically, the Israelites were exiled due to their disobedience, but God assures them of a return. The imagery of "walking upon" the land suggests dominion and possession, reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a>, where God tells him to walk through the land as a sign of his inheritance. This restoration is both physical and spiritual, indicating a renewed relationship with God.<p><b>they will possess you,</b><br>The concept of possession here is tied to the covenantal promise God made with the patriarchs, particularly in <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>, where God promises Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession. This possession is not merely about land ownership but also about fulfilling God's promises and the establishment of His kingdom on earth. It reflects the hope of a future where God's people live in harmony with His will.<p><b>and you will be their inheritance,</b><br>Inheritance in biblical terms often refers to the blessings and promises God bestows upon His people. In the context of Ezekiel, this inheritance is the land itself, a symbol of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant. The land as an inheritance also points to a deeper spiritual truth, where believers are seen as heirs of God's promises, as echoed in the New Testament in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, where believers are called co-heirs with Christ.<p><b>and you will no longer deprive them of their children.</b><br>This phrase addresses the historical context of Israel's suffering and loss during exile, where the land seemed to consume its inhabitants, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-13.htm">Ezekiel 36:13-14</a>. The promise that the land will no longer deprive them of their children signifies a reversal of the curse and a return to fruitfulness and blessing. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration and peace found in Christ, who brings life and abundance to His people, as seen in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel's messages often focused on both judgment and restoration for Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often depicted as straying from His commandments but promised restoration and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the physical land of Israel, which is promised to be fruitful and inhabited by God's people once again.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a time of judgment but also of prophetic hope for restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event prophesied by Ezekiel where God promises to bring His people back to their land and bless them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains committed to His covenant promises.
