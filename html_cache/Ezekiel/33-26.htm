In the historical context of ancient Israel, reliance on swords symbolizes a dependence on violence and warfare for security and success. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God calls His people to trust in Him rather than in their own might (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The Israelites' reliance on swords contrasts with the divine protection promised to those who obey God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-7</a>).<p><b>You have committed detestable acts</b><br>The term "detestable acts" refers to actions that are abominable in the sight of God, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. In the context of Ezekiel, these acts likely include idol worship and practices that violate the covenant relationship with God. The prophets frequently condemned such behavior, which led to the downfall of Israel and Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>). These acts are a direct violation of the holiness God demands from His people (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>).<p><b>And each of you has defiled his neighbor&#8217;s wife</b><br>This phrase addresses the sin of adultery, which is a breach of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Adultery not only violates the sanctity of marriage but also disrupts the social and moral fabric of the community. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, such actions were seen as a serious offense against both God and neighbor, warranting severe consequences (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). This sin is emblematic of the broader unfaithfulness of the people to their covenant with God.<p><b>Should you then possess the land?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the people's expectation of inheriting the land despite their disobedience. The land was a central promise of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), contingent upon the people's faithfulness to God. The question implies that their sinful behavior disqualifies them from enjoying the blessings of the covenant. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience and disobedience. The possession of the land is not merely a matter of inheritance but of living in accordance with God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book bearing his name.

The noun, Ezekiel's ever-recurring word, indicates both the act of idolatry and the foul orgiastic rites that accompanied it. The verb, curiously enough, has the feminine suffix.

So some have thought; but I agree with Keil, Smend, and others, in seeing only an error of transcription.
