In the context of ancient Israel, oppression often involved exploiting the poor or vulnerable, contrary to the Mosaic Law, which called for justice and care for the marginalized (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21-24</a>). The prophets frequently condemned oppression, highlighting God's concern for the downtrodden (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). This reflects God's character as just and compassionate, and it foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and justice (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<p><b>or retain a pledge</b><br>In ancient times, a pledge was a form of collateral for a loan. The Law of Moses provided specific instructions regarding pledges, such as returning a poor man's cloak by sunset (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12-13</a>). This ensured that the dignity and basic needs of the borrower were respected. The refusal to retain a pledge unjustly demonstrates integrity and compassion, aligning with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>or commit robbery</b><br>Robbery, the unlawful taking of another's property, was strictly prohibited in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of respecting others' rights and property. The prophets often rebuked Israel for such injustices, which were symptomatic of a broader societal decay (<a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). This call to honesty and respect for others' possessions is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to live righteously (<a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>).<p><b>He gives his bread to the hungry</b><br>Providing for the hungry is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting God's heart for the needy (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>). In the ancient Near East, hospitality and sharing food were vital cultural practices. This act of generosity is a tangible expression of love and obedience to God's commands (<a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>). Jesus exemplified this by feeding the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>) and teaching His followers to care for the least of these (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>).<p><b>and covers the naked with clothing</b><br>Clothing the naked is another expression of compassion and justice. In biblical times, clothing was a basic necessity, and providing it was a sign of mercy and righteousness (<a href="/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19-20</a>). This act is part of the broader biblical mandate to care for the poor and vulnerable. Jesus' parable of the sheep and the goats highlights the importance of such deeds as evidence of true faith (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>). This reflects God's provision and care, as seen in His covering of Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Holding it overnight signaled cold-hearted greed.
