Embroidered cloth was a luxury item in ancient times, often associated with royalty and wealth (<a href="/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>). This imagery reflects God's grace in elevating Israel to a position of prominence among the nations. The use of embroidery also suggests intricate and intentional design, indicating God's purposeful and detailed care for His people.<p><b>and gave you sandals of fine leather</b><br>Sandals of fine leather represent protection and status. In the ancient Near East, footwear was a sign of wealth and social standing. Leather sandals were durable and comfortable, contrasting with the barefoot state of poverty or slavery. This gift symbolizes God's provision of security and a new identity for Israel, elevating them from their previous state of destitution. The mention of leather, a valuable material, underscores the richness of God's blessings.<p><b>I wrapped you in fine linen</b><br>Fine linen was a symbol of purity and righteousness, often used in priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>). This phrase indicates a covering of holiness and a call to a life set apart for God. Linen was also associated with wealth and nobility, further emphasizing the honor bestowed upon Israel. The act of wrapping suggests a protective and intimate relationship, highlighting God's desire to envelop His people in His righteousness.<p><b>and covered you with silk</b><br>Silk, though not native to Israel, was a luxurious fabric imported from the East, signifying opulence and beauty. Covering with silk indicates God's abundant provision and the bestowing of beauty and splendor upon Israel. This imagery can be seen as a type of the righteousness of Christ, which covers believers, transforming them into a new creation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).

The thing intended is a fine kind of leather prepared from the skin of some sea animal; but the critics differ as to the particular animal intended, whether the dolphin or the dugong. "Fine linen" was a luxury much valued by the ancients, while "silk" is a word used only here and in <a href="/ezekiel/16-13.htm" title="Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceeding beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.">Ezekiel 16:13</a>, and its meaning is much questioned. By its etymology it is thought to express fineness of texture; and our translators have followed the rabbinical tradition in understanding it to mean silk.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Broidered work</span>; the "raiment of needlework" of <a href="/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; <a href="/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>. The word meets us again in <a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>, as among the imports of Tyre from Egypt. Curiously enough, the Hebrew verb (<span class="accented">rakam</span>) has passed through Arabic into tide languages of Western Europe, and we have the Italian <span class="accented">ricamare</span>, the Spanish <span class="accented">recamare</span>, the French <span class="accented">recamer</span>, for" embroidering." <span class="cmt_word">Badgers' skin.</span> Elsewhere in the Old Testament the word is found only in the Pentateuch (<a href="/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6, 8, 10</a>, e<span class="accented">t al.</span>). It has been commonly taken as meaning the skin of some animal - badger, dolphin, or porpoise, or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">seal</span>, which was used for sandals. All the older versions, however, take it as a word of colour, the LXX. giving <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("dark red"); Aquila, Symmachus, and Vulgate, <span class="accented">ianthino</span> ("violet"). Possibly the two meanings may coalesce, one giving the material, the other the tint which met the eye. <span class="cmt_word">Fine linen.</span> The byssus of Egyptian manufacture (<a href="/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Silk</span>. The Hebrew word (here and in ver. 13) does not occur elsewhere. The word so translated in <a href="/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a> is that which we find here and elsewhere for "fine linen." Silk, in the strict sense of the term, had its birthplace in China, and there is no evidence that even the commerce of Tyre extended so far; but the context points to some fine texture of the lawn or muslin kind, like the Coan vestments of the Greeks. So the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, as though it were made of fine hair; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">subtilia.</span> It is significant that three out of the four articles specified are prominent (as the references show) in the description of the tabernacle and the priestly dress, in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 39</a>.
