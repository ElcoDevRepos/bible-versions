These chambers likely served as storage or living quarters for priests. The inner walkway suggests a space for movement and access, emphasizing the organized and functional design of the temple. This reflects the orderliness and holiness expected in the service of God, paralleling the detailed instructions given for the Tabernacle in Exodus.<p><b>ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long</b><br>The specific measurements highlight the precision and intentionality in God's design. A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the walkway about 15 feet wide and 150 feet long. This size indicates a significant area for movement, suggesting the importance of accessibility and order in worship practices. The use of specific measurements is reminiscent of the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple, underscoring the continuity of God's plan and the importance of obedience to His specifications.<p><b>Their doors were on the north</b><br>The orientation of the doors to the north may have practical implications, such as protection from the sun, or symbolic ones, as the north often represents judgment or God's presence in biblical literature. In Ezekiel's vision, the north gate is associated with the glory of God entering the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>).

The phrase &#8220;in front&#8221; spotlights their public-facing side, indicating openness and service rather than secrecy.<p>&#8226; Similar arrangements are noted earlier: &#8220;Then he brought me into the outer court, where there were chambers&#8230; a pavement ran alongside the chambers&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17&#8211;18</a>). God designs His house so that ministry areas are visibly connected to the place of worship.<p>&#8226; By placing these rooms at the forefront, the vision reflects <a href="/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>, where priests must change garments before ministering&#8212;an outward-facing reminder of holiness made ready for service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was an inner walkway</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Inner walkway&#8221; (or passage) marks a corridor set apart from the bustle of the outer court (compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3&#8211;4</a>). It pictures an ordered flow: from common space &#8594; inner way &#8594; sacred chambers.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5&#8211;8</a> records Solomon&#8217;s temple having side chambers with passages. God repeats that pattern here, underscoring continuity in His design.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a> speaks of a &#8220;new and living way&#8221; into God&#8217;s presence. While Ezekiel sees a literal corridor, it echoes the spiritual truth that the Lord always provides a clear, consecrated approach for those He calls to serve.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long</b><p>&#8226; The Spirit-led guide carefully measures every dimension (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; 42:15&#8211;20). Ten cubits (about 15 ft / 4.5 m) grants ample space for priestly traffic; one hundred cubits (about 150 ft / 45 m) shows significant length.<p>&#8226; Precise numbers highlight God&#8217;s exactness (<a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15&#8211;17</a>) and invite trust that nothing in His sanctuary is random.<p>&#8226; These fixed dimensions also forecast stability in the coming millennial temple (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40&#8211;48</a>): worship won&#8217;t be cramped, rushed, or haphazard but spacious, orderly, and enduring.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their doors were on the north</b><p>&#8226; All entrances face the same direction, ensuring unified movement.

Consistent orientation knits the complex together.<p>&#8226; The north in Scripture often represents where threats arose (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>). Here, doors on the north declare that ministry rooms open toward the very quarter from which past judgment had come; grace now stands ready to meet what once brought peril.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a> records the prophet entering the temple by the north gate and seeing &#8220;the glory of the LORD fill the temple.&#8221; These doors thus position priests to move directly from service areas into the glorious presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a> portrays a literal corridor in God&#8217;s future temple: priestly chambers fronted by a generous inner walkway, precisely measured and opening to the north. Each detail&#8212;visibility, separation yet accessibility, exact dimensions, and unified orientation&#8212;reveals God&#8217;s commitment to order, holiness, and welcoming provision for those who serve Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A walk of ten cubits breadth inward.</span>--The meaning of this clause depends upon that of the next, "a way of one cubit." There is every reason <span class= "ital">to</span> suppose here an error of the text, and that <span class= "ital">one cubit</span> should be <span class= "ital">one hundred,</span> as it reads in the Greek. The change requires only a transposition of the first letters in one word, and a consequent alteration of one letter in the other. Exactly the same transposition has occurred in <a href="/ezekiel/42-16.htm" title="He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, where it is corrected in the margin of the Hebrew, and properly translated "five hundred" instead of "five cubits." One cannot conceive of a walk or an entrance of one cubit (twenty inches) serving any useful purpose. Assuming this change, the meaning will be that a walk (see Plan II., K [<a href="/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]) of 10 cubits wide and 100 long led to the entrance of the chambers. That this was on the north is plain from its being expressly said that the door was on the north. It may seem surprising that this should have been in the outer court, but a glance at the plan in connection with what is said below will explain the reason of the arrangement. The length of the walk, 100 cubits, just reaches to the steps of the north gate of the inner court. It will be remembered that in <a href="/context/ezekiel/40-39.htm" title="And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.">Ezekiel 40:39-43</a> this was described as the place for killing and preparing the sacrifices. Now, only the fat and kidneys of the sin and trespass and peace offerings were burnt upon the altar; the whole of the former (ordinarily) and the priests' portion of the latter were to be carried to this chamber (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm" title="Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). The walk was therefore placed in the best possible situation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the chambers a walk</span>. Whether this walk ran along the longer, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> northern, or in front of the eastern side of the chambers, and how it stood related to the <span class="cmt_word">way</span>, which is likewise mentioned in connection with the chambers, are litigated questions. The LXX. identifies the two, and understands a way in front of the chambers of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. Ewald and Keil so far agree with the LXX. as to change the one cubit way into a hundred-cubit way; but whereas Ewald thinks of a passage ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long, running from west to east between two sets of chambers, Keil speaks of a <span class="accented">walk</span> of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long in front of the cells, extending into a way of equal breadth and length, leading westward into the inner court. Havernick's, Hengstenberg's, and Kliefoth's idea, favored by Schroder, and probably the best, is that of a walk of ten cubits in front of the cells, and a <span class="accented">way</span> of one cubit leading into them from the walk. Dr. Currey reverses this, and makes a walk of ten cubits leading inward, and a <span class="accented">way</span>, or kerb, of one cubit in front.
