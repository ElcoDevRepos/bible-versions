It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the words are not Ezekiel's own but are directly from God. This establishes the seriousness and authenticity of the prophecy, aligning with similar introductions in other prophetic books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>Clap your hands, stomp your feet, and cry out &#8220;Alas!&#8221;</b><br>These actions symbolize intense emotion and lamentation. Clapping hands and stomping feet were gestures of derision or mourning in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The expression "Alas!" is a cry of woe, indicating deep sorrow or distress. This reflects the gravity of the situation and the impending judgment. Similar expressions of lament are found in Lamentations and other prophetic writings.<p><b>because of all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel,</b><br>The "wicked abominations" refer to the idolatry and moral corruption prevalent in Israel. This phrase highlights the reason for God's judgment, as Israel had turned away from the covenant and engaged in practices detestable to God. The term "abominations" is often used in the Old Testament to describe idolatry and other sins that provoke God's wrath, as seen in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.<p><b>who will fall by sword and famine and plague.</b><br>This triad of sword, famine, and plague represents the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. These were common forms of divine retribution in the ancient world, often used by God to discipline His people, as seen in the curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The use of these specific judgments underscores the severity of Israel's sin and the certainty of their punishment. This pattern of judgment is also echoed in the book of Revelation, indicating a continuity in how God deals with unrepentant sin throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and holy God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who have turned away from Him and engaged in idolatry and other abominations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword,_famine,_and_plague.htm">Sword, Famine, and Plague</a></b><br>These are the instruments of judgment that God declares will come upon Israel due to their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile_in_babylon.htm">Exile in Babylon</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, where the Israelites were living in captivity due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not a trivial matter to God.

Whenever the phrase &#8220;Lord GOD&#8221; appears, it unites God&#8217;s covenant name with His sovereign title, reminding readers that the coming judgment flows from both His faithfulness and His rulership (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Clap your hands</b><p>A sharp, physical gesture that draws instant attention. In Scripture, hand-clapping can mark approval (<a href="/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a>) but here it signals solemn warning, much like God&#8217;s own striking of hands in <a href="/ezekiel/21-17.htm">Ezekiel 21:17</a>. The prophet&#8217;s action becomes a visible sermon: judgment is not abstract; it is approaching tangibly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stomp your feet</b><p>Another vivid sign act. Stomping conveys urgency and indignation (<a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s footfalls echo God&#8217;s heartbeat against sin&#8212;each stomp announces, &#8220;This will happen; take notice.&#8221; The repeated sounds make the invisible verdict audible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cry out &#8220;Alas!&#8221;</b><p>A mournful exclamation that mingles grief with prophecy (<a href="/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>). Although judgment is certain, the lament shows God&#8217;s heart still aches over the loss (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). His messenger must feel what God feels: sorrow over sin&#8217;s consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel</b><p>The charge is comprehensive&#8212;&#8220;all&#8221; abominations.

God&#8217;s authority initiates the warning, His holiness demands judgment, and His grieving tone reveals that even in wrath He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot.</span>--The prophecy returns again to its heavy tidings of woe.
